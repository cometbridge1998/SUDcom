"Hi Samia,
Just a quick email to say that sounds like a great idea. Saturday is better for me because I'm meeting my parents on Sunday. So if that's still good for you, why don't you come here? Then you can see the new flat and all the work we've done on the kitchen since we moved in. We can eat at home and then go for a walk in the afternoon. It's going to be so good to catch up finally. I want to hear all about your new job!
Our address is 52 Charles Road, but it's a bit difficult to find because the house numbers are really strange here. If you turn left at the post office and keep going past the big white house on Charles Road, there's a small side street behind it with the houses 50-56 in. Don't ask me why the side street doesn't have a different name! But call me if you get lost and I'll come and get you.
Let me know if there's anything you do/don't like to eat. Really looking forward to seeing you!
See you soon!

"I had the most wonderful childhood. I grew up in San Diego, where it rains about two days a year, and it's always sunny and bright. I could ride my bike just about any day of the year, and had lots of friends. My best friend was George Kenny. George lived just a few houses down the block from me and we were the same age. Actually, I was about 28 days older than him - a fact that I always threw in his face. ""You must respect your elders,"" I would sometimes tell him. That usually got a nasty response from him. Anyway, George came up to me one day and said, ""Hey Richard, why don't we form a bicycle club?""
 
I thought about it for a while, and then he said, ""We could give ourselves a cool name and get hats and stickers and have lots of fun. What do you say?""  I immediately fell in love with the idea. ""You bet, Georgie Porgy!""  I used to call him that all the time even though I knew he hated it. Well before we knew it, we got a couple of other guys together and came up with the best name for a club ever. We were the ""White Skulls.""  Why we chose that name, I'll never know, but all the kids seemed to like it, so I was okay with it, too.
The four of us went to the local bike shop and we each picked out a skull decal to put on our bikes. I chose a green one, while Georgie Porgy picked red. He shouted: ""I am the red skull! I am the king of the club! If you don't like it, try to take it from me!""  George was a pretty big guy, so no one argued with him. We rode our bikes everywhere and had a great summer. That's how we formed the greatest bike club ever!",A2

Well done, Javier, on all your hard work this term. You are always active in speaking activities, and this is great. I always enjoy reading your writing too; you have very good ideas. You can see from your marks that reading is not a problem for you.
Sometimes you still make small grammar mistakes, and I think you can improve your vocabulary. I recommend you review many of the language points we studied this term. There is extra language practice in your online workbook.
The area you need to work on the most is listening. I know this is difficult for you. I recommend more practice at home. Listen to English TV shows, podcasts and radio as much as possible. I can give you a list of things to listen to.
I've enjoyed working with you. Have a nice holiday, and good luck for next term!

"Winter was approaching. Jason was excited for the coming season. It was his favorite time of a year. He loved the cold weather and snow. Jason lived in New York. During winter it would snow in New York. He always played in the snow, even as an adult. Jason would gather his family and friends at the park, where they had snowball fights. It was a lot of fun.
 
His favorite holiday Christmas occurred in winter. This was another reason why winter was Jason's favorite season. Every year, he bought presents for his friends and family. Jason loved seeing the look on their faces when they unwrapped their Christmas presents. It was better to give than to receive, Jason thought. Jason loved everything about Christmas. He enjoyed caroling. He loved singing Christmas music. He loved kissing his wife under the mistletoe. He loved drinking sweet eggnog. Jason sometimes even dressed up as Santa Claus for fun, and entertained his nephews.
Winter also came at the end of a year. New Year's Day would come after Christmas. Jason also loved this holiday. It was a day to celebrate the new year to come, while reflecting on the past one. Jason always made New Year's resolutions. Every year he made a new resolution. This year he promised to go skydiving. Last year, he promised himself to lose twenty pounds. Jason always kept his New Year's resolution. He lost twenty pounds in three months. This year was no exception. He planned to sign up for skydiving lessons in January of next year.
Jason could not stop thinking about winter. He could not wait for it to come. It was going to be the best winter yet. Jason needed to wait five more months because it was barely mid July.",A2

"Brian Nelson got his first skateboard when he was 9 years old. He started skating right away. He had friends at school that knew how to skate, so he would go to their houses after school. As time went by, Brian got better and better at skating. He could do a lot of tricks on his skateboard, but what Brian really loved was jumping over stairs with his skateboard. His record was 15 stairs, but he wanted to beat that record. Brian and his friends went to the Hollywood 18, where a lot of skaters go to make skating videos.
 
Brian knew that if he jumped over those stairs, he would become a legend with his friends. As he went up to the stairs, he started counting each stair one by one. He wanted to make sure they passed 15. On his first try, Brian jumped off his skateboard and landed on the grass next to the stairs. He wanted to try again, but he was scared. He finally got the nerve to try it again. This time he actually jumped over some stairs. Unfortunately, he didn't pass the 16th step in the staircase. He fell off his board, but he didn't get that hurt. Some girls were looking at Brian, and asked him if he could do it again. Brian knew he had to get it this time.
As Brian prepared for his jump, he kept looking at the girls that had gathered to see him. He was breathing heavy, but he knew he could do it. The time had arrived. Brian was ready to try it again. He pushed off the pavement, and started pedaling his skateboard faster and faster. He got to the top of the stairs and then he jumped. Brian was in the air for about 5 seconds and then he landed. The girls all applauded, and then Brian stopped his skateboard. He had done it. He beat his record. All the girls went up to give him a hug, but they all stayed away because he smelled. He started laughing. Everyone laughed and congratulated Brian.

"Kim was a housekeeper for a family in Beverly Hills. One morning when she went to work, she found a note from her boss. The note asked her to go to the supermarket and pick up a few things. There was a list of things Kim was supposed to buy. The note surprised Kim. She had only been a housekeeper for a week and had never been asked to go shopping before. Kim didn't even know where the nearest grocery store was. She also didn't know how to drive. Thankfully the note also told her that the boss's driver would take her to the market. There was also a $50 bill.
 
Once at the market Kim walked through looking for the items on her list. She was confused though. The list read ""one pound of apples"". Kim had purchased one kilogram of apples but never a pound. In her country, they used the metric system. She wasn't sure if a pound was more or less than a kilogram. Kim decided to ask one of the grocery workers. The grocery worker was kind and explained that a pound was about half a kilogram.
""I wouldn't worry about it though. Just use the scale,"" the grocery worker. Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric system she was used to. Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping cart.
The next item on the list was a gallon of milk. Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon was. She was used to buying a liter of milk. There was also no way to weigh a liter of milk. She was glad that the milk containers were labeled. She just wished the U.S. used the metric system.",A2
"Johnny enjoyed walking around with his long black hair. He also enjoyed the attention strangers and friends would give him. Strolling down the street was never the same after he started doing it with long hair. Johnny never wanted to cut his hair short ever again. He could think of no good reason to do so. This would all change with one conversation on a Saturday morning while having breakfast with his parents.
 
It seemed like any other regular Saturday morning at Johnny's house. Mom was cooking pancakes; dad was reading the newspaper; Johnny was waiting, sitting at the table drinking some orange juice. ""Johnny, it is time for you to get a job,"" Johnny's dad said all of a sudden, without any warning. Johnny nearly spit out his orange juice after hearing his dad's startling remark. ""What?"" Johnny said after gulping.
""There comes a time in every boy's life when he must finally cut his hair and get a job,"" Johnny's dad told him. ""But, dad!"" Johnny said, trying reasoning. ""No buts,"" Johnny's dad snapped. That afternoon Johnny's parents took him to a barber shop to get a haircut. He tried his best to hold back his tears on the way to the barber shop.
Johnny reluctantly sat down on the barber's chair wearing a frown on his face. ""Why the long face?"" asked the barber. ""He doesn't want to get a haircut,"" Johnny's mom replied. ""It's just hair. It'll grow back one day,"" the barber said, trying to cheer him up.
The following week, Johnny was hired at McDonald's. He had neat, short hair.",A2

"It has always been a dream of mine to visit New York. My parents always talked about going to New York, but we never went. I loved a lot of things about New York, but one thing that I really wanted to see was the Statue of Liberty. My parents aren't from the United States, but I was born here. They saw the Statue of Liberty as something more, not just as something people wanted to go see and take pictures of.
 
My parents never saw the Statue of Liberty because we lived in Texas. They crossed the border, and longed to see the Statue of Liberty with their own eyes, but never got the chance. I decided that I was going to fulfill their dream. I finally saved enough money for a plane ticket, and went to stay with a friend that I had met at home but now in New York. We talked over the Internet, and she told me that if I ever got the chance to go to New York, I could stay with her. I called her the day I got my plane ticket.
""Guess who's going to New York,"" I said. She started yelling and saying that it was going to be a lot of fun. I told her that my first stop had to be the Statue of Liberty. She told me that she couldn't wait. When I got out of the plane, I couldn't believe how cold it was. I got my luggage and met my friend outside of the airport. I hugged her and we got a taxi to take us to her home.
When we got to her house, she showed me her room and told me we would be leaving for the Statue of Liberty in an hour. I took a shower and put on two sweaters. We got a taxi, and went to see the Statue of Liberty. It took a while, but we finally got to the island. I couldn't believe the Statue of Liberty was right before my eyes. I started crying, and felt my parents were right here with me. I always felt like a foreigner in this country even though I was born here. Now I understood why they wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty so much.",A2
"Mike was having a beer in the living room one evening while watching a football game. His five-year-old son Rob was playing with Legos on the floor. ""Hey Dad, bet I can make one of these Legos disappear,"" Rob told his dad. Mike was only half paying attention to his son since his favorite team was playing. ""Uh huh,"" Mike absent-mindedly answered. ""Tada! I made it disappear!"" Rob said proudly. Mike asked his son what his secret was. ""A magician never tells,"" Rob said while tapping his nose. Mike shrugged his shoulders. ""Guess, Daddy. Guess!"" Rob encouraged.
 
Mike first guessed the Lego was in his son's pocket. He was wrong. Then Mike guessed that the Lego was in his son's sock. That too was a wrong guess. Mike gave up. ""It's in my nose, Dad!"" Rob proudly declared. Mike spit out his beer and rushed to look up his son's nose. He couldn't see anything up there. He went to the kitchen junk drawer and took out a small flashlight. Mike looked up his son's nose again. He still couldn't see the bright yellow Lego piece. ""Are you sure it's up there?"" Mike asked his son. Rob nodded. ""Does it hurt?"" Mike asked. Rob shook his head.
Mike didn't want to stick anything up his son's nose to try and take out the mini toy brick out. He was scared he would push the Lego up higher and hurt his son. ""I guess we have to go to the hospital,"" Mike told his son. Rob looked scared. It was a short drive to the hospital emergency room. Mike felt like the most negligent dad in the world when he told the triage nurse the reason for the visit. ""My son has a Lego stuck up his left nostril,"" Mike said in a low voice.",A2
"My best friend's name is Joseph Taylor, but he prefers to be called Joe. He does a lot of stupid stuff, and it usually gets him in trouble. The other day, while he was trying to impress some girls, he fell off his skateboard and broke his arm. Joe had to get his arm in a cast, but he told me it was worth it. He had already gotten three phone numbers from the girls he was trying to impress.
 
I always love Joe coming over to my house, because it makes my day more exciting. After he showed me his arm, Joe asked me if I wanted to go to the mall. ""Sure, why not?"" I said. I asked my mom for permission, and she said yes.
When we got to the mall, Joe wanted to get something to eat, so we went to McDonald's. We got two hamburgers and two sodas, and then we went walking around the mall. For some reason, Joe always liked stealing things from the stores at the mall. I never understood why he stole the things he did. For example, that day he stole three key chains, five pairs of socks, and a t-shirt of a television show that he had never heard of. Joe always said the same thing when he got out of the store, ""I love the rush of stealing!"" I always looked at him, shook my head, and called him an idiot.
The worst was yet to come. When we were leaving the mall to go catch the bus, a security guard grabbed Joe and me by the shoulders and told us we couldn't leave. The security guard took us to his office, and called our parents. I was worried because I knew my dad would yell at me. Joe, on the other hand, was laughing and was telling me jokes. When our parents showed up to pick us up, Joe looked at me, smiling, and said, ""See you in a couple of months."" I looked at him, shook my head, and called him an idiot.",A2

"Richard grew up in Los Angeles, California, and had a pretty good life. There was food on the table and he had plenty of clothes to wear. He didn't really have any needs. He went to a good school in a nice area of the city, and had many friends. Richard grew up with three older sisters, who also enjoyed their life in California, and had many friends. All this was possible because of their father Michael.
 
Michael was born into poverty in a small town just outside of Mexico City. When Michael was a boy, he remembered times when there was not enough food to eat, or fresh water to drink. Whenever he was thirsty, he would go to the river to collect water. Michael lived in a hut that had no floor. Many times he slept on the dirt, with just a blanket between him and the ground.
That all changed when, at the age of 17, Michael emigrated to the United States with his family. The first few years were almost as difficult as it was in Mexico, but gradually things began getting better for Michael and his family.
When Michael turned 19, he decided to enroll into a community college. His father had always stressed the importance of learning English while they lived in Mexico. That talent was very useful to Michael now. Soon Michael was bringing home excellent report cards. Because of this, he was able to transfer to a university and earned his degree in engineering.
Michael got a great job that paid well, which allowed him to move into a better part of town, and to help his parents, too. He soon had a family of his own. When Richard was born, it was the happiest day in Michael's life.",A2
"It was the first week of June. Gabi just finished her third year of high school in El Sereno. However, when she received her report card in the mail, she learned that she failed a semester of algebra. This meant she had to go to summer school.
 
Gabi was glad she had the chance to make up the class. She can't move on to the next level in math if she doesn't pass algebra. Summer school isn't easy though. Gabi has to master the material in 6 weeks instead of the 20 she had during the regular school year.
Summer school also meant that Gabi would be stuck in a hot classroom while most of her friends were at the beach or local amusement parks. Her friends passed algebra, so they had most of June, July, and August free from school work. Going to summer school also meant that Gabi's family had to change their summer vacation plans.
Gabi had to be in summer school from 9 a.m. to noon. She couldn't stay up late on weeknights or sleep in. She had to be on the bus at least an hour before class started or else she would be late. The classrooms were hot since the school building was old and did not have air conditioning. When Gabi came home from school, she couldn't do whatever she wanted. After Gabi took the bus home from school, she had homework to do.
This was the first time Gabi had to go to summer school. She wanted it to be the last time. Gabi made a promise to herself. In the fall, when regular classes begin again, she will try her hardest to pass. Sweating in a classroom while your friends are out having a good time is not fun. Summer break is not so much of a break when you have school.",A2

Learning to drive seemed scary for Joel at first. He had recently purchased his first car, which was now sitting on his driveway, looking clean and shiny. The previous owner had maintained it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its original condition. The car was a BMW, made in the year 1984. It was black and had only two doors. The interior was also black and had leather seating. The vehicle looked practically new to Joel, despite it being older than the new owner of it.
 
Joel was eager to start driving his new car. At 21, Joel had felt the need to be driving already. He was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. Joel had been getting around by means of public transportation. He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.
The first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his name. After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written test. Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit. Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find someone to teach him how to drive.
Joel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. ""If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent. Do you understand?"" Joel's uncle asked him. ""Yes, sir,"" responded Joel. After a month full of trial and error, Joel finally learned how to drive his car. Although it was scary at first, driving eventually became easy enough for Joel.",A2

"Anthony was a senior at high school and had a car. Even though Anthony wasn't 21, which is the legal age to buy alcohol, he would occasionally have a drink with his friends. Anthony was excited, because today was his prom day. He had his tuxedo on, and had a flower for his date. He got into his car and went to pick up his friend Jacob, and then to pick up Jennifer, his date.
 
When they showed up to the prom, Jacob's date and Jennifer went to the restroom. Jacob took out a small bottle of whiskey from his jacket pocket and told Anthony to take a drink. Anthony took some and didn't like it, but he still drank. As Anthony and Jennifer danced, he began to feel dizzy. He was drunk. ""Anthony, are you okay?"" Jennifer asked. Anthony looked at her and laughed. She figured out that he was drunk, and decided to leave with Jacob's date.
Anthony got mad and decided to leave. He got in his car and left. As he was driving down Mentel Avenue, he saw a police car following him. He got nervous and started chewing gum. Anthony was looking at the police car through his mirror so much that he almost took a red light. When the police saw this, he stopped Anthony.
The police gave him a few tests to see if he had been drinking, and Anthony failed them. The police took him away. His father picked him up and they went to talk to a lawyer. The lawyer said that Anthony would have to take alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, do community service, and pay a fine. Anthony's father said that Anthony would have to get a job as well to pay for the fine. Anthony decided never to drink after that. He said that it wasn't worth it.",A2

"It was the beginning of summer. David Lopez's dad wanted him to get a summer job. David had just finished school and was looking forward to enjoying his time off school. He wanted to sleep late, he wanted to play video games, and he wanted to spend time with his friends. David's dad decided that he would get a job for David. When he came home, he handed David a uniform for the Burger Hut. David was sad because he didn't want to work at the Burger Hut. He knew all of his friends went there, and he knew that his friends would make fun of him. David knew that his dad was able to get him this job because the owner was his dad's friend. The owner's name is Michael. David didn't really like him that much.
 
David had the first day at work. Everyone that worked at the Burger Hut had to wear a hat. David's hat fell into the oil where they made the fries. Michael had to get it out with a big spoon. After a week had passed by, David seemed to be getting used to working at the Burger Hut. Michael was impressed with how hard David worked, and told him he could take a day off.
During his day off, David went out with his friends. They went to the park and played some basketball, and then his friends decided to go get something to eat. David asked them where they wanted to go. They said they wanted to go eat at the Burger Hut. David tried to convince them to go somewhere else, but his friends really wanted to go to the Burger Hut.
When they got to the Burger Hut, David put on his sweater and his hat. He sat down in the far corner of the restaurant, and tried to hide himself from his co-workers and his boss. When his friends got their food, they went to sit down with David. Michael came out and saw David. He went up to him and said, ""You just can't get enough of this place, huh, David?"" Michael chuckled and then left. David's friends took a bite out of their burgers, and looked at David. ""You work here?"" One of David's friend asked. His another friend looked at him and said, ""Can you get me a job?"" David smiled and nervously said, ""I'll try.""",A2
"Hi Lucia
How are you? It was so nice to meet you last week in Sydney at the sales meeting. How was the rest of your trip? Did you see any kangaroos? I hope you got home to Mexico City OK.
Anyway, I have the documents about the new Berlin offices. We're going to be open in three months. I moved here from London just last week. They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect. There are lots of restaurants, cafes and banks in the area. There's also public transport; we are next to an U-Bahn (that is the name for the metro here). Maybe you can come and see them one day? I would love to show you Berlin, especially in the winter. You said you have never seen snow - you will see lots here!
Here's a photo of you and me at the restaurant in Sydney. That was a very fun night! Remember the singing Englishman? Crazy! Please send me any other photos you have of that night. Good memories.
Please give me your email address and I will send you the documents.

"The Empire State Building may be the most famous building in New York City. It is called the Empire State Building because New York State is called the Empire State. It is 1,454 feet tall. Many people think it is the tallest building in the world. This was true when it was built in 1931. In 1970, when the World Trade Center was built, that became the tallest building. Now, the Empire State Building is the fourth tallest building in the U.S. and the 23rd tallest in the world. Inside the building is mostly occupied by offices and stores.
 
People can go to the top of the building, where there is an observation deck. From the top there are beautiful views of New York City, especially at night. Most people take one of 73 elevators to the top. It takes less than one minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor. That is where there is a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can walk up to the top the fastest.
The landmark is not just famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane crashed into it. More than 30 people have tried to kill themselves by jumping off the building. In 1933 it was featured in the movie King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The building was also in the movie Sleepless in Seattle with Tom Hanks.
At night, the top of the Empire State Building is lit up in different colors. It is red and green on Christmas, red for Lunar New Year, and blue for Hanukkah. On the Fourth of July it is red, white, and blue.",A2

"I hate Professor Hernandez!
Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!
You think that's bad? He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!
But every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!
Professor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.
That's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?
He says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're stupid.
We should start a petition, and get him fired!
We should, but he can find out.
I know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.
He is so evil.
That's why this petition has to work!",A2
"He looked at the rising moon. It was rising above the houses. It was big and orange. It looked bigger than the rising sun. How could it be so big? How could it be so orange? Several hours later, he looked at the moon again. Now it was high in the sky. Now it was smaller. It wasn't orange anymore. Now it was white. What happened? It changed size. It changed color. Before, it was big and orange. It was like a big pumpkin. Now, it was smaller and white. It was like a light bulb. But it was still pretty. It was still bright. It was the brightest light in the sky.",A2

Why don't you try a different library?
I don't want to waste gas money.
But you might find your book.
What library do you suggest?

I don't know about that. What if you lose the books?
I won't. I swear on my life.
Wow, you're so serious.",A2

"The night was calm in Los Angeles, although the wind was particularly chilly. Frank had gotten out of work in Downtown Los Angeles around 11 p.m. He got his sweater, put his headphones on to listen to music, and put his backpack on. Frank liked taking his backpack to work, because he could take a change of clothes to work, so that he didn't have to wear his uniform after he got out. In order to get to his house, Frank had to take a bus and a train, but he didn't mind because he could listen to music.
 
After getting off the train, Frank got something to eat at a little restaurant that stayed open late and served hamburgers. After eating, Frank still had to walk for 30 minutes. While Frank was walking through a small street with a lot of homes, he noticed there was a car behind him following him slowly. He looked back and noticed it was a police car. He didn't mind because he wasn't doing anything illegal, so he kept walking.
As Frank was about to get home, the police car turned on the lights and drove directly to where Frank was at. They stopped and got out of the car. The two police officers surrounded Frank. Frank was used to this, and put his hands in the air. The police officers told him to put his hands on the hood, which he did.
As Frank was being searched, he asked the police officers why he was being searched. They ignored him and asked him questions. ""Do you have anything illegal on you? Have you been arrested before? Do you have a weapon?"" Frank answered ""no,"" to all of their questions. They put Frank in the back of the police car. Frank asked again, why he was being searched. One officer said, ""Because you are walking around the neighborhood with a hooded sweatshirt."" Frank had done nothing wrong, so the police let him go after searching his backpack.",A2

Oh, my word. Thank you so much.
It's raining cats and dogs out there.
More like lions and wolves!
I was watching the news.
What did they say?
This is going to be one heck of a storm.

No problem. I'm making some tea; would you like some?
Please. Something warm would be great at the moment!",A2
"Charles and Richard were known around the school for being troublemakers. They weren't allowed to attend the school dance, because they had gotten caught trying to sneak into the girls' locker room. Although Charles and Richard always got in trouble, sometimes they didn't deserve it. They just had a bad reputation. That's what happens when you have a bad reputation. The school dance was coming up. Charles and Richard had a plan on how to sneak in. They were really troublemakers this time.
 
It was the tradition that before each dance, the school band would perform the school's song. Along with the band, our mascot would come out to dance. Our mascot was a bulldog, but we had both a male and a female bulldogs. Charles and Richard decided to go into the dance as the bulldogs. They convinced the students who were going to be the mascots not to go.
On the night of the dance, Charles and Richard entered the gym as the mascots. They were dancing and running around the dance floor as mascots are supposed to do. Then the principal came up to say a few words and introduce the school band. Charles and Richard had a plan though. After the band started playing, they got behind the principal and started carrying him. The principal started yelling, but Charles and Richard didn't listen. They started walking closer and closer to the pool that was on the other side of the gym. Before the principal realized what was going to happen, they let him go directly into the pool. Everyone started laughing. Charles and Richard ran out of the gym quickly. No one realized they were Charles and Richard. Of course, the next day they got caught. They were really in trouble.",A2
"It is flu season. You must be careful. It is very easy to catch the flu. You should wash your hands often. You should get a flu shot. A flu shot will help protect you. But there is a problem with a flu shot. The problem is the needle. The nurse will stick a needle in your arm. Your arm will be sore for a day. Maybe two days. Nobody likes to have a sore arm. But which is worse--a sore arm, or a sore body? A sore body is worse than a sore arm. Do you want your arm to hurt, or do you want your whole body to hurt? Your body will hurt for a week. Maybe it will hurt for two weeks.",A2
"Why were you absent yesterday?
Why do you care?
You should be thankful I care so much about your education.
The truth is, I didn't hear the alarm clock.
You missed out on a very important lecture.
It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture.
Is she a good note taker?
I don't know. I guess?
If you were in class, you wouldn't have to rely on anyone's notes.
I can't change the past.
I know. Anyways, you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.
I suppose I could do that.",A2
"How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?
It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?
I want it in color.
Then it will be 20 cents per page.
That's kind of expensive.
Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.
I have one, but it's broken.
That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and white.
No, it has to be color.
Do you really not have 20 cents?
I do, but I'm really cheap.
Well, you don't really have a choice at this point.",A2
"Amisa was a single mother who worked from home tutoring students. She liked this job because it allowed her to stay home with her own little daughter Nimisha. Amisa saw all her clients at her kitchen table. She picked the kitchen table because from there she could watch her daughter, who usually stayed in the living room. Nimisha usually stayed in the living room when her mother was working with another student.
 
One afternoon though, Nimisha felt so thirsty. She had to get into the kitchen to get a drink. ""Mom, can I please have a drink?"" Nimisha asked. Amisa was annoyed. She was in the middle of a lesson. ""Yes, but you have to serve yourself because I'm working,"" Amisa said. Nimisha pulled a stepstool up to the kitchen cabinet and stood on it. She opened the kitchen cabinet and reached up to the top shelf to get a blue plastic cup. Then she slipped. Nimesha let out a huge scream. When Amisa got up to see what was wrong, she saw that her daughter's hand had slipped and the tongs of a large serving fork had gone through Nimisha's finger. Nimisha was crying. Amisa was scared. She had her client go home early, and was going to rush her daughter to the hospital. She didn't want to try and pull the fork out herself because she was worried that she might make the situation worse.
Nimisha lived four blocks from the hospital. She felt it was faster to walk to the hospital than call and wait for an ambulance. There was only one problem. It was very cold outside, and Amisa couldn't put a coat on her daughter when she had a huge serving fork protruding from one of her fingers. Amisa wrapped a blanket around her child and together they quickly walked to the hospital.
""My daughter has a fork stuck in her finger!"" Amisa yelled as she entered the emergency room.

" 
As a bartender at one of Los Angeles's busiest clubs, Daniel King often saw a lot of weird stuff. During the last party he worked, he saw five people throwing up on the dance floor, two fights, and a girl losing her top in front of everyone. The weirdest thing that ever happened to Daniel was when a drunken girl asked him to dance. He denied at first, but when she came back for another drink, she dragged him to the dance floor.
 
Girls had dragged Daniel to the dance floor before, but this time was different. The girls that dragged him out before actually knew how to dance, but this girl did not and was drunk. She kept jumping up and down. Shaking her body and looking at Daniel straight in the eyes. She was so drunk that she kept bumping into the other people that were dancing.
As the music played, the girl kept jumping and dancing. She kept yelling to Daniel that she had to go to the restroom, but he couldn't hear her. She yelled at Daniel once more and that's when it happened. She had an accident on the dance floor. Some of her urine actually got on Daniel's shoes. After it happened, the girl was so embarrassed that she ran out of the club crying. Daniel couldn't believe what had happened. He told people to move out of the way, while his friend came over to clean up the dance floor.
The weird thing about that incident was that the girl came back the next day looking for her cell phone, but she didn't remember Daniel. Daniel wanted to go hide, because he thought she would recognize him, but she didn't. Daniel decided that he would never go out to dance with another girl while he was working.",A2

7 . I got up and prepared my breakfast - the usual eggs and bread with coffee.
3 . Then, when I sat in the garden to eat, I noticed two enormous brown eyes looking at me.
5 . They belonged to a large white dog I had never seen before.
4 . Feeling frightened, I tried to smile and said 'Hello boy'.
6. The dog heard this and jumped onto the chair next to me, smelt my eggs and started to eat.

Of course, take as much as you need.
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's no problem at all.
I love the subtle smell of this brand!

"Gabriel loved working as a waiter. He loved going to work during holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter. When there was work during holidays, it usually meant there would be a big tip in his check. He was very friendly with the people, and everyone liked working with him. The restaurant where he worked was doing a special brunch for Easter this year. Gabriel's boss Jackie called him to see if he could work. Gabriel said yes.
 
When Gabriel showed up, he saw a giant Easter bunny walking around the restaurant. He started chuckling to himself. He had always wanted to wear a costume, and walk around talking to people. As people started showing up, he noticed that the Easter bunny wasn't coming out to greet the people. Gabriel had a job to do though. He started cleaning the tables he was assigned; when he finished, he went to take his break.
While he was eating, Jackie went up to Gabriel and said ""I think we need you to take over as the Easter bunny, would you be willing to do that?"" Gabriel said of course, because he didn't want to let down the boss, but also because he secretly wanted to do it. As he walked out fully dressed like the Easter Bunny, he saw children lining up to take pictures with him. He walked over and took pictures with everyone that was in line.
There was a little train for the children outside in the garden. After he took the pictures, he decided to go on the train and ride it with the children. The children were asking him if he was the real Easter Bunny, and if he had been to Disneyland, Gabriel nodded his head. After he got off the train, he walked around the restaurant and started dancing in the restaurant. People started to applaud as they ate. It was the first time Gabriel ever dressed up as the Easter Bunny, but he loved every second of it.",A2
"Last week Chris went on her first deep sea fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island. She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but had never gone fishing in the ocean. Her dad liked to fish very often. Her big brother Jack was never the outdoor type, so her dad took her out often. One of his favorite spots was Lake Isabella, which was about two hours from their home. She recalls how she and her dad would spend a long, leisurely day driving to the lake, and then taking his small boat out on the water. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Those memories remain some of her most cherished moments of her life.
 
Chris has a friend called Robert. On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on his company's fishing trip. Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but would be a lot of fun. He knew Chris enjoyed lake fishing and figured she would have a great time. ""Okay,"" said Chris, and to the ocean they went.
The first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. ""Wow, this boat really rocks,"" Chris told Robert. ""Don't worry about it. You will get used to it,"" he said. The trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how quickly she lost sight of the mainland. It was a bit scary when she thought about how alone they were in this great ocean.  Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid. Before long, thousands of squid rose to the surface and were collected for bait.
After about an hour, Chris didn't feel the rocking motion anymore. They were ready to fish. Chris caught her first ocean trout. It was a beautiful day.",A2
"Age doesn't matter when it comes to helping out the needy. Shane is a 9-year-old boy that loves to help out. During a school field trip, Shane's class went to visit a warehouse where people donate food and clothes for the homeless. Shane was inspired by the workers he saw there. When he got home, he told his mom all about his field trip. Shane told his mom that he wanted to go help out.
 
A week later, Shane's mom told him the good news. They were going to help out at a local kitchen that gave food to the homeless. Shane got excited. He got his coat and shoes. As Shane and his mom were getting to the local kitchen, Shane saw how all the homeless people were living. He saw the tents in the street and how some people didn't even have shoes. He got sad, and told his mom that he was going to make sure everyone had shoes, food, and blankets.
When they got inside, the manager of the kitchen thanked Shane and his mom for coming down to help. They started serving food to the homeless and everyone that passed by thanked Shane for coming down to help. Shane felt safe and started talking to the homeless people. He told them that he wanted to help them. When they finished, Shane didn't want to leave, but they had to.
Shane told his mom that he wanted to do more. During school, Shane asked his teacher to let him say something to the class. He told them about what he had seen. He asked his friends and his teacher if they had any clothes they didn't wear anymore, so that he could donate them. His friends brought some clothes the next day, but his teacher did something better. She brought her friend, who was a reporter, and ran a story on Shane about how much he wanted to help out the homeless. Thousands of people donated clothes and food. Shane and his mother couldn't believe it.",A2
"Carl was just 15 when he was charged with arson. He snuck into his high school with a friend and lit the auditorium curtains on fire. They thought they would have gotten away with it, but the store across the street from the school had a camera that saw Carl and his friend come out of the school. The police caught Carl and his friend while they were eating at a restaurant that was next to the high school. They were taken to jail.
 
Carl admitted to burning down the auditorium, and got sentenced for 10 years in prison. His friend got the same. The judge asked them why they did it, and Carl said, ""Because we were bored and we didn't like the school.""
News reporters were at the school. They wanted to talk to the parents, who were at the school talking to the police and the principal. Carl's father came out first and was on his way to the police station when a news reporter asked him about the situation. He said, ""My son just lost his childhood, and he will never get that back. Carl was never a bad child, but he started acting up when he got to high school. His mom couldn't believe what he had done. People make mistakes, and Carl's mistake is going to cost him a lot.""
The principal said that the school will be working hard to get the auditorium rebuilt, but it will take a couple of years. The school says that it will cost a million dollars to rebuild the auditorium. According to his parents, Carl said that he wishes he could take it all back and that it was a stupid mistake.",A2

"Music had always played a big role in Jonathan's life. He liked different types of music, from Hip-Hop to Rock 'n' Roll. One of his favorite bands was The Beatles. He could hear them every day. Jonathan didn't feel that way towards any other band. He had all of their albums, and he knew all the lyrics to their songs.
 
One day, Jonathan and his girlfriend Sarah went for a ride in Jonathan's car. Sarah was excited to show Jonathan a new band she had heard about. Sarah brought the CD and played it for Jonathan as they drove around town. The first song was called 40 Day Dream, and the band's name was Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeroes. Jonathan didn't think much of them at first, maybe because he was driving, but after they stopped driving, he had the song stuck in his head.
Jonathan decided to look for their albums. They had three out, so Jonathan decided to buy them all. During a rainy day, Jonathan invited Sarah to his house and they listened to all three of their albums. Jonathan loved the band. He loved how they sounded like bands from the past. He loved how they reminded him of The Beatles.
When he and Sarah were listening to the third album, the song If I were Free came on. Jonathan jumped off his bed and started dancing alone. Sarah looked at him, smiled, and laughed. Jonathan started clapping, and then he started singing. ""The light became too heavy, and I fell into a dream,"" he sang. He fell next to Sarah, looked at her and said, ""I feel like I'm in a dream when I listen to this band. Thank you for introducing me to them.""",A2

"Getting a driving license is very important for a 16-year-old. Today was my 16th birthday, and my dad promised to take me to the Department of Motor Vehicles to do my driving test. I passed my written test already, so it was for a road test today. When we got to DMV, I began to get really nervous. I was driving my dad's car, and I didn't want to mess up and crash. My dad looked at me and told me that everything would be fine.
 
I had stayed up all night thinking about how it would go and if I would pass the test. When the driver instructor came out, he told me to get in the car and turn on the lights. I did as I was told. He then told me to turn on the left turn signal, and then the right turn signal. They both worked, so it was time to start driving. The instructor had dark sunglasses on, and he didn't say much when we got in the car.
The instructor gave me directions to go straight and make a right turn at the next stop sign, which was a couple of blocks away. I did as I was told, and then kept going straight. Then the instructor told me to keep going straight until I reached a street called Marengo and then to turn left. As I drove, I kept looking for Marengo Street, and thought I might pass it and the instructor would deduct points from my test.
When I finally found Marengo Street, I turned to tell the instructor. That was when I realized that he was asleep. I couldn't believe it. This was an important event in my life, an event that I had been worried about for months. When we finished, he woke up and told me I had done a good job, and that I would be getting my license in about a month. I laughed, and thanked him. I went to tell my dad the good news.",A2
"Tom noticed that every morning when he went to school, his mother would give him a letter to drop in the mailbox on the corner. ""Who are you writing to so much?"" he asked. ""I'm just trying my luck,"" Tom's mother told him.
 
A few weeks after Tom started mailing out the letters, he noticed that his mother was getting a lot more mail. Some of the mail advertised on the envelope that she might already be a winner. His mother was also getting many more magazines. Some of the magazines were about things his mother didn't eve care about, like cats.
""Mom, why are you getting so many magazines?"" Tom asked her. She told him that she had been entering contests and that part of the process included subscribing to magazines. ""It will increase my chances of winning the jackpot,"" she told him. Soon the family mailbox was filled with more contests announcements, magazines, and bills.
Tom's mother was surprised. She didn't think that checking off the boxes of magazines that looked interesting and affixing stickers to the return forms would cost her. She was spending more and more money and hadn't won anything. She wanted to be like the people in the commercials she saw on television. People bringing balloons and oversized checks surprised those people who entered the contests. Tom read the fine print. The magazines weren't free and Tom's mother was not increasing her chances of winning anything by subscribing. Tom did some research and found out there had even been lawsuits against the companies running the contests and selling the magazine subscriptions.
Tom's mother felt bad. ""It pays to win, mom, but you can't pay to win,"" Tom told her. Tom's mother wondered what she was going to do with all these magazines.",A2
"Jenny had always wanted a pet of her own. She wanted something to take care of, someone to be there whenever she came back home, and most of all, an animal to be best friends with. Jenny would constantly ask her dad to buy her a pet, but her dad always refused. Jenny's dad knew having a pet was a big responsibility. He did not think Jenny was ready to own a pet at ten years old, and that was exactly what he told her when she asked for one. ""When will I be ready?"" Jenny asked one day. ""Wait until you're twelve,"" Jenny's dad replied. This was good news for Jenny. All she had to do now was to be patient.
 
Two years had passed. Jenny had been counting down the days on her calendar. The morning of her twelfth birthday, Jenny jumped on her dad's bed and immediately reminded him of what he had said two years ago. ""Have you decided on what pet to get?"" Jenny's dad asked. Jenny could not respond. She had not made up her mind on what kind of pet she wanted. ""Let me think about it,"" she said and ran to her room.
Jenny took into consideration all the pets she could imagine. She imagined a white fluffy cat that she'd name Tabby or a large bright golden retriever that she'd name Yellow and play Frisbee with in the afternoons. She imagined owning colorful Macaw that she'd name Polly and have conversations with whenever she felt lonely. After an hour of weighing in the options, Jenny had made up her mind.
Jenny's dad was surprised when he found out what pet his daughter had chosen. ""I want a horse,"" she declared when she walked back into her dad's bedroom. ""How about something a little less expensive,"" he said to Jenny. ""A pony?"" she cleverly replied. ""Let's go to the pet shop,"" Jenny's dad said.",A2

They're all math books, and according to the system, you still have them.
Oh yeah, I do! I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed.
Once you return them and pay the fee, you can borrow books again.
But I really need to borrow those books now.
I can put them on hold for you.

"Carla moved to San Francisco two years ago. All of her family was in Boston. Every year she tried to visit her family twice. She would go once in the summer and once during the Christmas holiday. Traveling cross-country was expensive though. She needed to find a way to save money on her travel. She decided to try and use an airline loyalty program to see if that would help.
 
There was one airline that Carla preferred to travel on. Every time she used that airline, there were hardly any delays and the trip was always comfortable. That airline featured in-seat DIRECTV, so she could watch her favorite television shows while traveling. She could also order food and beverages right from her seat. An extra perk was that each seat had an electric outlet. This made it easy for Carla to plug in her computer and do work on her trip.
On her last trip, Carla decided to sign up for that airline's loyalty program. She would earn points for every trip she made. Those points could be used towards air travel. The airline worker informed Carla that she could earn even more points if she signed up for the airline sponsored credit card. The card had a low interest rate and no annual fee. For every dollar Carla spent, she would earn one point to use towards travel. Carla signed up for the credit card. She had good credit, so she was approved. Carla used that credit card to pay for a round-trip ticket to Boston.
After only one trip, Carla had earned enough points for a free one-way ticket. That saved her almost $500. It felt like traveling for free. Carla decided to stay loyal to this airline.",A2

"I really need a book, but I didn't see it on the shelf.
According to the computer, it's not checked out yet.
Then why isn't it on the proper shelf?
It means that someone in this library is holding it right now.
So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?
Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it.
I really need that book.
You're going to have to look everywhere for it.
Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?

Soccer is a fun game. It is very popular. It is popular all over the world. It is fun to watch. It is fun to play. It is a simple game. There are two teams. They play on a big grassy field. There is one ball. There are two goals with nets. Each team tries to kick the ball into the other team's net. The players cannot use their hands. They cannot touch the ball with their hands. They use their feet to move the ball. They use their chests to move the ball. They use their heads to move the ball. The players run back and forth. They slide on the grass. They crash into one another. They play to win.,A2
"Nancy Young had always loved celebrating the Fourth of July, the holiday that celebrates America's independence. She loved the meaning of the day. She also loved lighting fireworks. She loved all types of fireworks. Nancy had three brothers, and they all loved the Fourth of July. Nancy's youngest brother Peter loved lighting up the fireworks. Although Nancy's parents didn't have that much money, they decided to buy a lot of fireworks for their children. They wanted their children to have a great Fourth of July. Once they got the fireworks, Nancy decided to split them with her brothers. She got the most, and her brothers got the rest.
 
Nancy's parents decided to go to the park to light the fireworks this year. Peter decided to light the first one. It exploded, and scared Nancy. Nancy decided to light one. It was a sparkler, which meant that it would only send sparks up into the sky, and would not explode. Nancy loved how it looked. She lit another one to see how it would look like. Peter had the idea to jump over the fireworks. Even though Nancy said no, Peter decided to jump over it.
Peter got ready. He tied his shoes to make sure his shoe laces weren't hanging out of his shoes, and that he had enough distance to jump over the sparks. Peter started running and then jumped. When he landed on the other side, he started screaming in pain. A spark had gotten into Peter's eye. He fell to the ground and started asking for ice. Nancy brought him a bag of ice to cover his eye. During the next day, Peter had to get glasses because of the damage he had suffered in his eye. The doctor asked him, ""What's the important lesson here?"" Peter responded with, ""Don't jump over fireworks.""",A2
"Emma's son Johnny had been bugging her about joining a sports team like all his friends. One day she took Johnny to the local recreational center, where they were having tryouts for baseball. She found out about the tryouts from a banner she saw hanging outside the recreation center when she was driving by. Baseball seemed like the perfect sport for Johnny to learn to play since it is nicknamed America's Pastime.
 
Emma took her son to the tryouts after school. ""I'm sorry,"" one of the coaches told Emma. ""Johnny was too young to try out for baseball. Since he was six years old, he could try out for T-ball, though.""
T-ball is similar to baseball except that there is no pitcher. Instead the ball is placed on a stand called a ""T"" because of its shape. This makes it easier for younger kids to hit. T-ball games are also shorter than regular baseball games. Regular baseball games last nine innings. Emma couldn't imagine her son standing still for nine minutes.
T-ball sounded like a good way to introduce her son to the responsibilities of being on a sports team and the rules of baseball. Emma had to bring Johnny back on a different day to try out for T-ball. When she did, he was put on a team. After paying a fee, Johnny was given a uniform. Johnny looked at the back of his uniform. ""Hey, look! Mom. I'm number one!"" he said proudly.
Once Johnny started playing though, it was clear to Emma that he was not very good at baseball. He stuck with it though, and his team ended the season in fourth place. There were only four teams in the T-ball league. ""Can I play again next season,"" Johnny asked his mom. ""Yes, but see if you can get another number,"" she told him.",A2
"George is going to make a salad. He is going to make a simple salad. It will be a simple salad, but it will also be delicious. His salad will have only two ingredients. One ingredient is fresh cucumber. A cucumber is dark green and long. George will peel the skin off the cucumber. He will throw the skin in the trash. He won't eat the skin.

" 
It is the first day of the summer. George and his friend Carlos are planning on going on a camping trip. It is going to be the best camping trip, which will last three days. While Carlos makes invitations for their friends, George is going to make a list of activities to do while they are there. Last year, their camping trip was not entirely a success. They got a flat tire on the way to their campsite. They also had a bear take some of their food. They don't want to encounter that again.
 
This year, they plan to go prepared. George is going to take a spare tire and gas, just in case they run out. Carlos is going to try and find a better method of storing food without attracting animals to their campsite. They don't want anything to ruin this year's trip. On this trip, George and Carlos have invited ten of their friends. Everyone is excited. George has prepared his list of activities to do with his friends.
They plan to go mountain climbing, hiking, kayaking, fishing, and to play a few games of flag football. For night activities, they plan to tell stories, sing songs along with George's guitar, and play some board games. Carlos and his friends have pitched in some money for food. With the list Carlos made, they are going to have food, vegetables, chicken, and fruit juice.

"My job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning, as I'm always in a rush. There's never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive.
I usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it's not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical music CD's in the car - Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.
The drive to work takes about one hour. Going back home in the evening after work takes even longer, maybe around 70 minutes. Lately I've been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time.",A2

"""Hello Dolly"" is one of the classic American plays. It was first shown in New York City in 1964 and won 10 Tony Awards. The Tony Awards are live theater's version of the Oscars. When I was in high school, our theater department decided to put on our version of ""Hello Dolly"", and I just had to get involved. I wasn't an actor, but I was hoping there was something I could do, so I went to the director and asked him if he needed help. To my surprise, he said yes!
 
The director's name was Michael Thomas. I almost screamed in delight when he said I could be a part of the play. ""Oh, my god!"" I said. ""I would love to be a stagehand. Are you kidding me?"" A stagehand is someone who moves all the props and background in between acts. It is precision work that takes coordination between several people. I loved working in the ""wings"", which is what the backstage in called in theater lingo. The stage manager is the person who runs the backstage during a play, and the job carries a lot of responsibility. My first stage manager was a cool guy who liked me a lot, so I got the best assignments. ""Hey George, how would you like to man the lighting?"" he asked, and I jumped at the opportunity.
""You bet, boss!"" I responded. That was how I got put in charge of the lighting for one of the best plays ever written. Even though this was just a high school production, we played to packed houses almost every night we were on. I did such a great job that when the theater department decided to put on ""West Side Story"" the next semester, they asked me if I wanted to join the team. It was such an honor to be selected, so of course my answer was yes!",A2

"Francesca picked up her seven-year-old son from school one afternoon. Isaac proudly showed his mother what he had made at school that day. It was a card made out of brightly colored construction paper. ""It's for Father's Day,"" Isaac explained. The card was cut into the shape of a man's dress shirt with a drawing of a man's dress tie. Inside the card, Isaac had written the words ""Happy Father's Day.""
 
Francesca wasn't familiar with Father's Day as it wasn't something celebrated in her home country. So she asked her neighbor Genny about it. Genny told her that Father's Day, like Mother's Day, is a made up holiday in the United States. It is always celebrated on the second Sunday in June. People give fathers cards, presents, go out to eat at a restaurant, or do something special that day. ""It's a day to show gratitude to your father,"" Genny explained.
Francesca understood, but she also felt a little bad. While the Father's Day card Isaac made was nice, Isaac's father never wore a dress shirt or a tie. Isaac's father, Tim, wore a uniform to work. On his days off, he liked to dress casually and comfortably. The most dressed up he got was by wearing a polo shirt.
Francesca had an idea. She went shopping the day before Father's Day to get her husband a surprise. On Father's Day morning, she and Isaac gave Tim a box wrapped up in nice paper. ""Happy Father's Day,"" Francesca and Tim shouted.
When Tim unwrapped the box, he laughed. Inside the box was the Father's Day card Isaac made in school. Also inside the box were a dress shirt and a tie. They were the same color as the card Isaac made. Tim, Francesca, and Isaac went next door to Genny's house for a barbecue. Tim wore the dress shirt and tie.",A2
"David's cell phone started vibrating in the middle of the night. He woke up right away and nervously reached to his nightstand. He always set his cell phone to vibrate and charged it next to his bed when he went to sleep. David looked at the time on his cell phone. It was two in the morning. The only time someone contacted him at that hour was when there was an emergency.
 
He read the message on his cell phone. It was an emergency. The text message said that a little boy had been kidnapped near where David lived. The boy had been taken into an orange Honda Civic. The text message also gave the license plate number of the car. There was also a picture of the little boy and a written description of what the boy was wearing when he was kidnapped. The boy's name was Adam.
David didn't feel like he could do anything at two o'clock in the morning. He went back to sleep. In the morning, however, he woke up thinking about the message and about the boy. David had never heard about an Amber Alert before. He decided to look it up on his computer. He learned that the Amber Alert system is an emergency broadcast system used to let people know when a child is abducted. It was named for a little girl named Amber Hagerman, who was kidnapped when riding her bike in Texas. Little Amber was found dead later.
The news made David feel sad and angry, but he also felt like now he could do something to help. He decided to stay aware to see if he saw a boy or a car matching the description in the Amber Alert.",A2
"Karen and Jack had been trying to have a child for many years with no success. All that changed one day, when they received the greatest gift in the world. That day, nearly one year ago, they had a healthy baby girl. They named her Julie, and it was the happiest day of their lives.
 
Karen loves to dress Julie up in pretty pastel colors complete with bows and ribbons. Karen thinks she's the most beautiful girl in the world. The other day, the small family went shopping, and all of a sudden, Karen let out a loud scream! ""Oh, my god!"" Jack ran over thinking something had gone wrong. ""What's the matter?"" he asked. ""Nothing, she answered. ""Look at this adorable outfit. It's perfect for little Julie,"" she said. Jack got a little upset about this. He was running toward Karen thinking she had fallen or that something had happened to Julie, but all that happened is that she found a pretty blue dress for their baby girl.
Shopping malls in the United States are all over the country. Some are very large, but most of them have anywhere between 50 to 100 shops each. They are places people go to eat and shop, or go to see a movie, or just hang out with friends. American teenagers love these places, especially in Los Angeles, when it gets very warm. The kids go there to cool off. It was no surprise Karen wanted to go there to buy little Julie her dress. If shoppers don't find what they are looking for in one shop, there's always another one close by at a shopping mall.

"Johnny has always loved taking long walks. He lived close to Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The park is very beautiful. It has trees and winding roads leading up to the hills where he could get lost for hours. Whenever he hiked up there, he always felt at peace with the world and with himself. It was his personal safe zone.
 
One day Johnny was hiking up a trail that he had not tried before, and soon he was lost. Griffith Park is very large and people have been lost up there in the past, but he knew he would find a way back. After about an hour of walking around in circles, Johnny heard something move in the bushes. It scared him for a second, but he just kept walking.
It was starting to get dark and he began thinking that he might have to spend the night in a cave or under a rock or something. That was when he heard more noise coming from the trail. It was very loud. ""Hey!"" Johnny shouted. ""What's out there?  Stay away!""  He was sure it was a coyote or maybe a mountain lion. He started looking for something to fight back with in case of an attack. Johnny was in a full-panic and started shaking uncontrollably as the noise got closer and closer. Just as he thought that an animal was going to jump out of the bushes, he saw the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. She was tall and blonde and had long straight hair and the first thing she said was ""Are you okay?""
It turned out her name was Sheila, and she was a park ranger. She told Johnny that she had seen him walk up the trail earlier, but did not see him come back down, so she decided to come up to see if everything was okay. Johnny had never been so embarrassed in his life, but that was okay. The couple ended up getting married a little more than a year after that. She saved Johnny's life that day, in more ways than one.",A2
"""You want me to buy you what?"" Ken asked Elizabeth. He was sure he hadn't heard her correctly. Elizabeth had just moved in with Ken. She came to Los Angeles from New York City after a year of long distance dating. ""I want you to buy me a shopping cart,"" Elizabeth repeated. ""In Los Angeles there are two types of people who use shopping carts. The homeless are one. They use shopping carts to carry their possessions. Old ladies are the second. They use it to carry their laundry back and forth, their groceries, and maybe even to sell tamales,"" Ken explained.
 
Elizabeth felt insulted. ""Are you saying I'm an old lady?"" she asked. She then continued to explain that she didn't want to rely on Ken to drive her to the supermarket or the laundromat. Elizabeth didn't know how to drive, but she wanted to be self-sufficient. ""Besides,"" she continued, ""in New York City everyone has a shopping cart, not just the homeless or old ladies.""
One afternoon when Elizabeth came home from work, there was a red shopping cart in the driveway. Ken had put a big red bow on it. ""Do you like your new wheels?"" Ken asked Elizabeth. She felt happy now that she could handle some chores on her own.
The next day she loaded the shopping cart with dirty clothes and set off to walk the three blocks to the nearest laundromat. This was not as easy as she thought. The sidewalks were uneven and the cart often got stuck, causing dirty socks to leap out of the cart. Elizabeth had to stop several times to pick up stray clothes. Then nearly every house between her house and the laundromat had a big dog that barked at her. Elizabeth hated big scary dogs.",A2

"Jose Luis was taking the train to work one day when he noticed a woman with a big German Shepard getting on the train. This made him nervous. What if that dog attacked someone? Jose Luis didn't know that people could bring pets with them onto trains. It seemed unsafe. He stepped closer to the dog. The German Shepard seemed friendly enough. Just as he put out his hand to pet the dog, the woman stopped him.
 
""Please don't pet him. He's working,"" the lady told him. Jose Luis didn't understand. The woman explained that she was blind and that the dog Hampton acted as her eyes, helping her navigate her way around the city. The woman pointed out the special vest that Hampton was wearing. The vest was printed with the words ""service animal"".
Jose Luis had never heard of service animals before. ""Service animals like Hampton are allowed into public places that most pets are not. Hampton is more than a pet. He helps me be self-sufficient and do the things that I need to do in the city,"" the woman explained. The woman also told Jose Luis that service animals had to go through special training so that they learn how to behave in public places and do not get distracted. ""People need to help too though, by not petting him,"" the woman added.
The woman continued to explain that service animals do not just help the blind. Some animals act as therapy animals. Therapy animals go into hospitals and nursing homes. These animals lower the stress levels of people who are very sick or who have just had operations. They also encourage people to recover. Therapy animals are especially popular in children's hospitals. Dogs really can be man's best friends.",A2
"John had been saving his allowance for three weeks so that he could buy a telescope he had seen advertised in the newspaper. According to the advertisement, the telescope cost $94,99. John also did some odd jobs around the neighborhood where he lived. He mowed the neighbor's lawn and took another neighbor's dog for a walk. Finally he had 95 dollars.
 
One Saturday John walked to the store. He had brought with him the advertisement, which he had cut out from the newspaper. He asked a salesperson in the store where he could find the telescope advertised. He pulled out the newspaper ad and showed it to the salesperson to make sure they took him to the right one. The salesperson showed John where the telescopes were and together they looked for the one he wanted. It was called the Vega 600.
""I found it!"" John told the salesperson. The salesperson confirmed that the Vega 600 cost $94.99 and brought the box to the cash register so that John could pay for it. John was so excited. He felt like jumping up and down. He had worked so hard to get this.
""That will be $104.01,"" the salesperson told John. ""Did you advertise it as $94.99?"" John asked angrily. He thought the salesperson was trying to take advantage of him. ""Yes, it is, but we have to add sales tax. It's the law. In California the sales tax is 9.5 percent, ""the salesperson explained. ""Why don't you just put the final price on advertisements and price tags then?"" John asked. ""Then everything seems more expensive and people won't come into the store to buy,"" the salesperson explained. ""Everything is more expensive!"" John said angrily, walking out of the store without the telescope.

She paid him. She thanked him. Now her worries were over. She didn't have to worry anymore. Every time she turned the key, her car started immediately. But a week later, her car didn't start immediately. It started after five minutes. She called up the mechanic. He said to bring the car in. He would look at it again.",A2
"When Mario was 19 years old, he bought his first car. It was a brand-new 1985 Toyota Corolla. He was on top of the world! It was beautiful, and was really fast and fun to drive. Living in Southern California without a car is not a good idea. The region is so spread out that it could take hours getting from one part of town to another if you use public transportation. You are not anyone in Los Angeles if you don't have a car, or at least that is what some people say.
 
Before that, Mario had never owned or bought a car in his life. His father warned him about the sales people. ""Don't ever pay the asking price, son,"" he said. Mario looked at him with disbelief. ""What do you take me for, dad?  I am not an idiot. I know not to pay the first offer,"" he screamed back. His dad offered to go with him to the car dealer, but Mario wanted to go alone. It was his money and his car, and he was determined to do this alone.
When Mario got to the car dealer, a nice man came up to him and asked if he wanted to take the car he was looking at for a test drive. Mario said, ""Yes, of course.""  So they went for a drive. Mario fell in love with the car and the salesman knew immediately that he was going to make some money. It turns out that you should never let a salesman know you're interested in anything you want to purchase. Mario didn't know how to negotiate and wound up paying too much for the car. He really didn't care, though. He owned his first car. When he told his dad what he paid for it, he thought his dad was going to be mad, but he just said, ""That's okay, son. That same dealer ripped me off when I bought my first car, too.""",A2

"Many years ago, one of the best ways to spend a Saturday night with your girlfriend was to take her to the drive-in. Drive-in theaters were first opened in Southern California because of the car culture that exists here. People could go see a movie in the comfort and privacy of their own car. I remember the first time I went to a drive-in. I was 18 years old and was dating my future wife Caroline. We went on a double-date with my best friend Alfred and his girl Jeannie. The drive-in we visited that night was called the Starlight. It was close to home, and it had the best sound system of all the drive-ins. It also had a huge screen. We went to see ""Forrest Gump"" that night, mainly because Carol wanted to see it. ""I heard it is a great movie,"" she said. I really didn't know anything about the movie, but I did want to see something.
 
""Forrest Gump"" was indeed one of the best movies ever made. It had everything -- humor, drama, tragedy, and triumph. It is a great film. Watching it that night under the stars with Carol on my arm was the greatest night. ""I tell you babe, I was wrong about this movie. I really liked it,"" I said. She just smiled and gave me a hug. Alfred and Jeannie were busy kissing in the back seat, which is another advantage of going to a drive-in.
Those old drive-ins were around for decades, but soon after ""Forrest Gump"" came out, many of them started closing. They closed because of the new multiplex theaters popping up all over the country. People had a choice of many films to watch at those theaters, and soon the drive-in was gone.  In Los Angeles, there is only one remaining drive-in I know of -- the Vineland. There might be more, but I don't know where. It is sad to see them go, but the memories are still with me.",A2
"What have you done to my hair?
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I asked for a light trim, not for a butchering!
I had to cut out all the split ends.
I look like a grapefruit! My head is too round!
It's a short bob, very stylish.
It looks more like a bowl cut to me!
It looks fantastic, don't exaggerate.
I hate it! I'm not paying for this!
You have to pay me for my labor!
I'm never coming here ever again!
Trust me, you won't be missed.",A2
"Helen was outside watering her lawn like she does every other day. She loves her lawn and her garden. She has the prettiest house on the block, but it's only because she works at it very hard. Helen is in her mid-40s but you wouldn't know it by looking at her. Her face is nearly wrinkle-free, and it seems she has more energy than people half her age.
 
""Good morning, Helen."" I said as I walked outside on my way to work. ""Hi Robert, how are you?"" she asked. ""Fine! I'm doing fine. Your yard is looking good,"" I said. And it was. Sometimes it really bothers me that I can't get my lawn to look as nice as hers. ""What's your secret, Helen?"" I asked. ""Secret to what?"" She answered. ""To having such a beautiful lawn!  I water mine, I seed mine every year and I still can't get it to look as good as yours. I'm jealous!"" I said with a smile. Helen just nodded and had this funny little look on her face that suggested she was just better at keeping her lawn nice than I was.
I didn't like that look, but I guess it's okay that she feels that way. I've known Helen since she was a little girl and things have not gone well with her lately. She's been alone for a long time. She wasn't very pretty when she was young. She had terrible acne that covered her face from ear to ear. It made her very self-conscious so she didn't go out on dates very much, but that all changed when she met Josh. They were together for more than 10 years until, sadly, they went their separate ways. Since then, Helen has nurtured and tended her garden as if it were her child.
When I got home later that day, she was outside working on her roses. I said hello to her as I walked to my door, and she smiled brightly. She looked beautiful.",A2
"I got out of school at 7 p.m. and didn't have anything to do, so I started walking home. I lived an hour away from my school, so I got home at around 8 p.m. When I opened the door to go inside, I saw my brother, my mom, and my brother's girlfriend all sitting down on the couch. My brother Jeff was sitting with his girlfriend Betty. I walked in slowly. I looked at my mom, who had tears in her eyes. It was very tense. I turned to Jeff. ""She's pregnant!"" Jeff said.
 
Jeff and his girlfriend started laughing and said, ""Yes!"" I started jumping up and down with joy. I always wanted to be an uncle. My first reaction was to start screaming, ""It wasn't me! It wasn't me!"" I started screaming that because my parents always thought I was going to be the first one to give them a grandchild. They certainly didn't think Jeff was going to do it. I gave them each a hug, and I wished them luck.
After eight and a half months had passed, Betty gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. My family and I were as happy as it could be. They named the baby Mark. Mark was the name of my father, who passed away a year ago. My brother said that he looked like my dad, so he decided to give him the name in honor of my dad. We all gathered at the hospital and started laughing, talking. We each took turns carrying the baby. It was the happiest moment in our family's history. We only wished that my father would have been a part of it. Jeff looked at baby Mark. He told me that my father's spirit was here. He would always be there to look over and take care of Mark. I smiled and gave him a hug.",A2
"Ruth Campbell had never gone to Disneyland as a child. She was now 40 years old with two children, a boy and girl. The boy's name was Jeff and the girl's name was Carol. When Jeff was 11 and Carol was 13, Ruth decided to take her kids to Disneyland, which would be the first time any of them ever went. When they arrived at Disneyland, Ruth explained to her children that if they got split up, they would meet at the front of the park.
 
The first thing Ruth did when they got inside was looking for Mickey Mouse. She wanted to take pictures with all the characters at Disneyland. She even made a list of the characters she wanted to take pictures with. Her children looked at her and smiled. They saw that their mom was acting like a little girl again. She was giggling every time she took a picture with a character.
Her favorite Disney character was Donald Duck, so she kept an eye open for him. When they were in line for a ride, she saw that Donald was taking pictures with people by a restaurant. She told her children: ""Look, guys, it's Donald! Hopefully, he is still there when we get out."" When they got out of the ride, Donald wasn't there anymore. Ruth told her children that it was okay, and that they would bump into him later on.
They enjoyed their day at Disneyland until it was time for the park to close. Ruth and her children were looking at the fireworks that they put on every night at Disneyland. She hugged her children and told them she loved them. They hugged her back and continued to watch the show. When they were leaving the park, her children noticed that Donald was taking photos with some other people, and their mom hadn't noticed him yet. Carol told her mom that she needed to go to the restroom, and asked her mom to wait for her for a moment. While she was waiting for Carol to come back from the restroom, Ruth felt someone poke her on her shoulder. It was Donald Duck with Carol! Ruth began tearing up a bit, and hugged both of them. They all took photos with Donald Duck, the last character on Ruth's list.",A2
Andrew got down on his hands and knees. He put a dry sponge into the bucket. The bucket was full of soapy water. He squeezed the sponge. He scrubbed the kitchen floor. There were marks on the floor. There were spots on the floor. There was old food on the floor. He scrubbed the floor clean. Then he took the bucket into the bathroom. He poured the soapy water into the tub. The water went down the drain. He turned on the shower. He rinsed the tub. He turned the bucket over so it would dry. He washed his hands.,A2
"His dad liked to fly balloons. His dad bought big balloons and filled them with helium. Helium is a gas. It is a gas that makes balloons float into the sky. One day his dad brought home a new balloon. He took it out of the box. He took it outside. He tied the balloon to spikes with ropes. The spikes were in the ground. The ropes and spikes kept the balloon on the ground. He filled the balloon with helium. He asked Junior what the new balloon looked like. ""It looks like a flying saucer!"" said Junior. ""It looks like a real flying saucer! Is there an alien inside?""",A2
"When Donna was a little girl, she had a dog named Sandy. Sandy was a furry, brown, medium-sized dog. She weighed about 25 lbs., and was a happy dog. Donna was only 10 years old, and couldn't remember a day in her life without Sandy by her side. Sandy was Donna's best friend.
 
The two could be seen together on most days. Donna cared for Sandy every day. She fed her, brushed her, and played with her. Donna went with Sandy whenever it was time to take her to the veterinarian's office for a physical checkup. Donna always wanted to be with her furry friend on those occasions because she didn't want Sandy to feel alone and afraid. Donna was also responsible for cleaning up after Sandy, which meant picking up her poop. Donna didn't mind though. She loved Sandy.
One day, Donna and Sandy were coming home from the park. They were walking down the street near their home when Donna let Sandy off her leash. Donna knew she wasn't supposed to let her off the leash, but she always did when they were just a few houses away. Sandy would run into the yard, yelping and howling while waiting for Donna to get home.
This day was different though. Sandy saw a cat across the street and started running after the cat just as Donna's neighbor was driving home. Sandy was hit and killed by the speeding car as Donna screamed in shock. ""No!"" yelled Donna, but it was too late. Sandy was gone. Donna was very sad. She blamed herself for Sandy's tragic death, but her mom told her that Sandy was happy in Heaven now. Donna held a little service for her doggie and buried her in the back yard so that Sandy would always be near her. Donna knew they would be together again.",A2

"It was a stupid mistake. Before I tell you about my mistake, I have to tell you about my father. My father Joseph Thomas was a big name in the music business. He managed a lot of different rock bands in the '60s. By the end of his career, he had saved up some money and decided to buy himself a cabin in a little town in Oregon. He didn't want to live in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, or any other big cities. He wanted to escape the big city life.
 
My father died in that cabin three years ago. I found out about his life in the cabin a week after he died. He never really liked to answer his cell phone. It would always be on low battery, or off. He never bothered to charge it. He simply liked listening to his records and drinking whiskey.
During his time in the music industry, my father had collected various objects. He had different items from different artists. He had one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, and a medallion that Janis Joplin had given him. Did I know this? No, I didn't. My dad always kept to himself. He was out on the road a lot, and he never really cared about keeping in touch with his kids. So, when he died, I figured all of his stuff at the cabin would be garbage. I told the town's Sheriff to throw everything out. I also told him to send me the paperwork for the cabin. I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. I couldn't believe it! Hendrix's guitar sold for over a million dollars, and so did the medallion. As I had already asked the Shariff to throw out everything as garbage, I wasn't entitled to anything, which probably made my father happy.",A2

"Three men once lived in a small town in Texas. One was a musician, another was an artist, and the other was a poor homeless man. One day the artist was going to start working on a new sculpture, but didn't have the necessary tools to start. He went downtown and saw a poor homeless man. Because the artist was new in town and got lost, he asked the homeless man where the nearest art supply store was. The homeless man told him that it was the red and white building around the corner. The artist looked at him and said thank you. He gave the homeless man a ten-dollar bill with the words ""pass it forward"" written on the bill. The homeless man took the money and said: ""God bless you!""
 
A few hours had passed, and the homeless man started getting hungry. He walked around in town, and saw a young musician playing outside a cafe. The homeless man sat down and started listening to the music played by the musician. A waiter from the cafe came out and told the homeless man that he had to leave, because he wasn't buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy the homeless man something to eat. The waiter looked at the musician and said okay. The homeless man thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The homeless man left.
After the musician had finished playing at the cafe, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. As they were walking around and looking at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked. It was a young man helping out an older man who had fallen down. She wanted to buy it, but didn't have enough money. The musician told her not to worry. He pulled out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist. As the musician and his girlfriend walked away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill, and smiled. ""Well, look at that, you found your way back home,"" said the artist.",A2
"Callie noticed that her son Jesus, a high school senior, was acting very strangely. He seemed to be hoarding his allowance and having many whispery conversations with his friends. When Callie asked Jesus about it, he admitted that he was nervous about prom, a dance held at the end of senior year of high school for those graduating. Jesus was feeling a lot of pressure to ask a girl to be his date for the prom. Girls, like Lexi, were also feeling pressure about a guy they liked asking to the prom. A photographer would be on hand to capture on film forever who said yes.
 
Then there was the matter of the clothes. Young men like Jesus didn't have to worry so much. Most of them would just rent tuxedos. Young women, like Lexi, however, had to make sure that whatever dress they wore would be unique. There is nothing more embarrassing than going to the prom and having another girl wearing the same dress.
For the parents, like Callie, one of the biggest stressor was money. Tickets to the prom cost $120 per student. Renting tuxedos cost a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that traditionally he had to buy his date a corsage. Most students split the cost of a limousine among friends.
Callie had more than money on her mind, though. She had heard stories about wild things happening on prom night. She worried about Jesus drinking alcohol, even though he was underage.
Callie encouraged her son not to worry so much about finding a date. Maybe he could go to prom with a group of friends. That was what Jesus ended up doing. It was fine until it was time to be photographed. All of Jesus's friends split up into couples. Jesus posed alone.",A2
"In a small town of California, there lived a boy by the name of Desmond Walker. Desmond lived with his mom and dad in a red three-bedroom house. Desmond was ten years old and had an active imagination. His mother had her hand full watching over Desmond. That boy of hers would get in all sorts of trouble. ""Always safety first, Desmond!"" is what she always repeated to her son.
 
Desmond and his mother went out grocery shopping one Friday evening. The supermarket's parking lot was jam-packed with cars that Friday evening. ""Stick close to me, Desmond,"" said his mom as they entered the supermarket. Desmond's mom asked him to fetch a shopping cart. He grabbed a shopping cart, and started heading back to where his mom was. Desmond then hopped on the shopping cart and raced away at top speed. ""That's not too smart, Desmond,"" said a voice in Desmond's head. Desmond stopped and began pushing the cart like before. He remembered what his mom always said to him, ""Always safety first"".
After Desmond handed the cart to his mother, the two headed towards the dairy section to grab some milk. ""Desmond, stay close to me,"" Desmond's mom said. The supermarket was bustling with shoppers. Desmond stood close to his mother as they treaded carefully through the hordes of people. Then, in an instance, Desmond thought of running away and hiding from his mom as a trick. Just as he was about to do so, Desmond heard the voice again. ""That's not a good idea, Desmond,"" the voice said. Desmond had remembered his mom's golden rule: ""Always safety first.""
""You've been such a good boy today,"" Desmond's mom said to Desmond. Desmond said thank you and was treated to ice-cream as a reward.",A2
"My last class of the day was my physical education class. I always hated it. For the past three years, people had found ways to embarrass me. Things weren't so bad at first. A basketball hit me in the head when I was talking to a girl. I was trying to climb the big rope in the gym and fell down in front of everyone, who started laughing. However, the worst thing was yet to happen.
 
At the end of a year, we always have a test to see how we have improved. We have to run a mile. The whole class does this at the same time. I wasn't the fastest runner, but I knew I could get a good score for this test. For this activity, we have to go into the locker room and change into our uniform. I left my uniform in my locker the other day since it was clean. When I opened my locker, I saw a note saying, ""Buy new uniform, loser."" Someone had broken into my locker and took my clothes. I told the teacher, who went into his office and gave me an old uniform that had been left behind. ""Suit up and I'll see you out there,"" he said.
I tried tying a rope around the shorts to make them fit, but they wouldn't. The bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be mad if I didn't get out there. I started running, and barely got there before he started calling names. After he finished with the roll call, we started the test. The whole class set off running. I was doing okay at the beginning. After a while, people started passing me. A lot of people laughed at my shorts. Then it happened. One guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up falling. My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. That was when all the girls started passing me. One of them shouted, ""Ew, he doesn't have clean underwear."" I picked up my shorts, and walked the rest of the mile. It was the most embarrassing moment in my life.",A2
"Bobby loved to eat. He ate hamburgers, French fries, hot dogs, pizza, donuts, and ice-cream, just to name a few. No matter how much Bobby ate, he never got a stomachache. It is no surprise that Bobby weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. It might be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. Bobby didn't care that he was big. He was content with how he looked and loved eating as much as he could.
 
Bobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. ""Knock, knock,"" Bobby would say. ""Who's there?"" friends would ask. ""Gorilla,"" Bobby replied. ""Gorilla who?"" they'd ask back. ""Gorilla me a hamburger!"" Bobby replied, delivering the punch line. The joke was in how the word gorilla sounded like grill. Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.
Even though Bobby was popular and friendly, he was still teased by some kids in school. Fat boy Bobby was the nick name the mean kids gave to Bobby. Whenever Bobby heard the nick name, he would reply with gusto, ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" The bullies would funnily reply, ""I bet you would eat those sticks and stones, fat boy Bobby!"" and scurry off running.
Bobby did not let idiotic name calling bother him. He had more important things to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. Bobby knew that one day he would have to lose weight if he wished to live a longer life. Until that day came, Bobby would continue eating what he wanted and as much he wanted.",A2

"One hot summer day, Jay and his friends were playing outside. The sun shined down on Jay and his friends as they kicked a soccer ball back and fourth. Soccer was Jay's favorite sport to play. Almost every day Jay would invite his friends from his neighborhood to come out and play soccer in the street. Jay dreamed of one day being a professional soccer player. He imagined shooting a goal and hearing the roar of thousands of people as they cheered his name throughout the soccer stadium. Jay knew it would require a lot of practice if he wished to make his dream a reality.
 
One day, as the sun was beaming down on the street where Jay and his friends played earlier, an ice-cream truck approached. As soon as Jay heard the ice-cream truck's music playing, he ran outside his house with two dollars in his hand. Jay looked around to see where the ice-cream truck was. As soon as he spotted it down the street he bolted towards it. Jay's friends had arrived first and were already asking the ice-cream man for a cone of their favorite flavor of ice-cream. This gave Jay time to think about what flavor to get. ""Should I get chocolate or vanilla?"" Jay asked himself. ""What's it going to be, son?"" the ice-cream man asked Jay when he noticed he was the last kid standing without an ice-cream cone. ""I'll have Pistachio, please,"" Jay responded after some hesitation.
This summer had turned out to be the best so far for Jay. Tomorrow he would play soccer once more, and if the ice-cream truck came around, he would ask his parents for another two dollars. Jay was not looking forward to starting his school year in two weeks.",A2

"It was Sunday, the last time I saw my dog. His name is Spot, because his whole body is covered with spots. He is a good dog. He never bites, and almost never barks. I got Spot when I was around 9 years old. All of my friends knew that Spot was like my best friend. So, when I told everyone that Spot had gotten lost, they all came out trying to help out. We looked for hours.
 
My dad told me that maybe Spot got picked up by a dog catcher. If that was true, then he would be at the dog pound, which is where they send all the dogs that get lost. My friend Mark told me that they put pictures of all the dogs they find in the street online, so I went online to try. I spent more than an hour checking the online pictures of the dogs, and finally found my Spot. I started jumping with joy.
I went with my mom and dad to pick up Spot. When we got there, he started barking and running in circles all around his cage. I knew he was happy to see us. He had been lost for about two weeks. When we got him home, he ran around the backyard and ran directly into his little house my dad and I built for him. He started barking really loudly, which is weird for Spot. As soon as my sister heard Spot, she came running out to try and catch him. He ran around her and then let himself be captured. I think he just wanted to be petted. I knew he was happy to be back home and even happier when I brought out his food. I hope Spot never gets lost again.

"His friends used to call him Hoss, as in Hoss Cartwright from the TV show Bonanza. At 62 and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character.
Now, they call him The Beast. 
The nickname is apt. Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon. He's completed an Olympic-distance triathlon and lost more than 100 pounds. And on August 26, he 'll participate in his first full-length Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky.
Like they say, he's a beast.
 What he does after this Ironman, I do n't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh. I hope he can find something to focus all this energy on. 
From Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 -- First day of the Couch to 5K program. That was not good. But at least I did the whole workout -LRB- 1.98 miles / 32 minutes / 16:10 pace -RRB-
Change is a funny thing, Rucker says. Often, the desire to change grows over time. A series of events leads to an a ha moment, when desire must meet with the proper tools and the right inspiration.
In the summer of 2010, Rucker, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee. His daughter was 11 at the time, a little daredevil, and wanted to ride all the roller coasters. Unfortunately, Rucker could n't fit on any of them with her.
 She was devastated; I was crushed, Rucker said. But even that was n't enough to get me started on the journey. I guess I just did n't know how to do it. 
Does parenting make us fat ?
In January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills240-pound weight loss.
Her transformation was his inspiration. But he still was n't ready to change.
After weighing in at about 365 pounds, he stopped stepping on the scale. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and put on medication for high blood pressure. He feared that he was diabetic but would n't visit his doctor.
The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain. Once again, he had overindulged the night before, and his digestive system revolted. He was tired, sick and unhappy.
 Something clicked, he said. I realized that if I kept doing it, I would significantly shorten my life. 
Rucker took Millsdieting hints to heart and cut out sugary drinks. He dropped his two-liter-a-day soda habit and picked up water. He stopped ordering McDonald's McGriddles for breakfast and eating peanut M&M s by the pound. He threw away his Cheez-Its.
 It's hard to say what my daily -LRB- calorie -RRB- intake was, he said, looking back. I did it to myself. I was really unhappy with the way my life was, and I think food was that comfort for me. 
June 19, 2011 -- Last day of Couch 2 5K. I think I 'll call it The Father's Day Beastly 5K. I was the only competitor and I finished in 1st place. I ca n't even begin to explain how I feel right now. And no one or no thing can ever take this away from me. I AM a runner. I AM an achiever. I AM a Beast. On to Bridge 2 10K !!! 
Rucker's job as a real estate attorney kept him sedentary. So he started to walk on his lunch break, using his iPhone to post his distance on DailyMile.com. The site shared his progress on Twitter and Facebook. Friends posted replies that the site's app read aloud to Rucker through his headphones during workouts.
Wiring the world to fight obesity
 That was a huge motivator to me, he said. Even though I was by myself, I still had people to encourage me. 
He ran his first official 5K race, the Great Buffalo Chase, on July 4, 2011, in 39 minutes. Less than a month later, he tackled a 10K, finishing dead last but finishing all the same. His blog that night complained about the cross-country course's hills but promised to begin training for a half-marathon the next day.
 The focus he has, the drive he has... it's so refreshing, Annita Rucker said. It's the old Mark I did n't even know -- probably the Mark from law school. 
The Ruckers married in October 2000. For 11 years, Annita Rucker watched the man she married -- the dreamer, the achiever -- struggle to maintain his optimism while grappling with a shrinking housing market and a growing body.
Their son and daughter -- two children from Rucker's first marriage -- came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young kids while her husband remained stationary.
 I used to complain that he was living life on the sidelines, never participating, she said. Now, he's so active with them. Last year, my father had Parkinson's and was hospitalized for 10 weeks. Mark stepped up to the plate and did all the cooking, the laundry, everything. Before this, that never would have happened. 
 My wife jokes, I 've got a brand new husband, Rucker said with a long laugh. I think she's a lot happier with me... because I 'm much happier. 
August 18, 2011 -- Three mile walk at work on my lunch break. Some days I got ta dig down deep to find the motivation. Some days it's really hard. Today is one of those days. 
Rucker is now training for his first Ironman competition. A typical week includes 4:30 a.m. swims, 6-mile runs after work and hours of cycling on Saturday and Sunday. At 260 pounds, he's stopped focusing on losing weight and started focusing on building muscle.
There are good and bad days. Some blog posts sing of the serotonin rushing through his brain. Others show his discouragement of a bad swim or a slow run. He's a beast, but one who feels pain.
Ironman champ: The importance of R&R
Still, it's amazing, even to him, that a guy who less than two years ago got winded walking up a flight of stairs can push himself this far, this fast.
 I 'm the guy in the overalls -LRB- who's -RRB- shoveling the coal in the train, he said. I do n't know exactly where it's going, but I 'm going to do everything I can to keep it moving. 
February 18, 2012 -- Woot woot !! I 'm a marathoner !! -LRB- 26.4 miles / 6 hours, 13 minutes / 14:07 pace -RRB-
Rucker has rejoined the social world. He volunteers at the Red Cross and is involved in his local Rotary chapter. This year, his family went back to Dollywood and rode all the rides together.
Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him. Possible title for his speech: Be the Beast that you can be. 
 When I was so overweight, I felt so dead to everything, Rucker said. There was this little voice in my head that said, for so long, This is the best your life is ever going to be.And that voice is gone. I 've extinguished that voice.

"Friends make life easier, or at least they should. My best friend's name is Susan. I call her Suzy. Suzy and I would always hang out together. Just to clarify, my name is Michael. Yes, I am a boy, and Susan is a girl. Everyone that knew us always thought we were in a relationship, but that wasn't the case. I loved Suzy like a sister, and she loved me like a brother. Well, I used to think she did.
 
It all started when Suzy got a boyfriend. I was happy for her, because she was sad and lonely. Those were her words, not mine. When she introduced me to Richard, her boyfriend, I tried my best to get along with him. Although I tried my best, Richard didn't seem to like me. Maybe his friends told him that Suzy and I were always hanging around, and they thought we were secretly in love with each other.
Richard became increasingly jealous whenever my name was mentioned. It started tearing up their relationship. Suzy began to stay away from me. I would call her, go over to her house, or wait for her outside of school, but she was always busy with Richard. She would say, ""Sorry, Mike. I'll call you when I get home, okay?"" I knew it was a lie. Suzy and I haven't spoken in a month. As I knew Suzy had always wanted to go to Las Vegas, so I was going to surprise Suzy by telling her that I was going to take her. However, it seemed that the ship had sailed. I heard Suzy and Richard were going to Las Vegas for her birthday.
I'm moving on, and I'm hanging out with some other friends. It's not the same, but I guess anyone who chooses a relationship over a friendship was never a good friend to begin with. Yet, I find myself questioning ""What are Friends?""",A2
"Chris knew many of the other fathers made fun of him. He was pretty sure some of the mothers did too. He was the president of the Parent-Teacher Association at his daughter's school. He organized all the bake sales, book sales and met with the school principal regularly to share concerns he heard from other parents. This is not why parents made fun of him. Other parents made fun of him because this was all he did. Chris was a stay-at-home dad. His wife Maureen had a demanding full-time job working for an investment bank. She made an excellent salary, but the job meant going in early and coming home late.
 
rather focus on his daughter and what was going on at her school. He became the main caregiver. Chris handled all of the household duties. He took his daughter to and from school. He did all the grocery shopping and cooked all the meals. He cleaned the house and helped his daughter with her homework. Everyone in the neighborhood called Chris ""Mr. Mom"". There were other names Chris heard people calling him, like ""house husband"" and ""house-spouse"".
Chris didn't mind his role at all. He felt secure as a man. He didn't believe that a woman's place was in the home. He was glad that his wife loved her job and worked hard. He worked hard, too. He just didn't get a salary like Maureen did. He was happy being paid the love and appreciation from his family.
Sometimes Chris felt lonely though. When he took his daughter to the park, there were no other dads around. He felt strange talking to the mothers. He didn't want them to think he was hitting on them or trying to pick them up.",A2
"It's been six months since Jason White's parents were officially divorced. At first Jason was sad. He thought that it was his fault that his parents had gotten divorced. One day, while Jason was at his dad's new apartment, he asked his dad a question. ""Why did you get divorced with mom, dad?"" Jason asked. His dad didn't want to talk about it. He told Jason that he would understand when he was older.
 
The following day, Jason went back home with his mother. During the car ride, he asked his mother the same question. ""Why did you get divorced with dad, mom?"" Jason asked. She told Jason the same thing his father had told him. Jason didn't understand why they couldn't tell him the reason. He was ten years old, but he felt like he was still six. A week had passed since Jason asked his parents the question. Things weren't looking great for his parents. His mom would cry, and his dad would always be mad.
Jason began getting angry with his parents. One day, after school, Jason decided to go over to his friend Matt's house. He asked Matt if he could sleep over for a couple of days. Matt said yes, so Jason went to get some clothes from his house before his mom got home. Jason got back to Matt's house. He told Matt not to tell Matt's mom and his mom that he was staying there. He didn't want anyone to know that he was there. Matt agreed.
At around midnight, Jason's mom called Matt's mom to ask if Jason had stopped by. As Matt didn't tell his mom, so his mom said no. The following day, Jason saw that the police were looking for him. His mother and father had called the police. Matt began to get worried because he didn't want to lie to the police. He called Jason's parents, and told them that Jason was at his house. When Jason's parents arrived at Matt's house, Jason wanted to leave through the window. Matt told him that his parents were worried sick, and that he had to go back. His parents came into Matt's room, and saw Jason. They ran to him and hugged him. Jason's dad turned to his ex-wife and gave her a big hug and a kiss. Jason felt happy, but confused.",A2
"I was 10 years old when we first got a computer. I didn't know what to do with it, so I just played video games on it. My brother was six years older than me, so he would use the computer to go into chat rooms. After we had had the computer for around a year, I noticed my brother would always be in chat rooms. He would always have a private message open as well. It took me another year to realize that my brother was dating someone online.
 
I always knew my brother's girlfriend as SnowBunny85, because he never told us officially that she was his girlfriend. I later found out her name was Lily. My brother always tried to be careful not to leave any pictures Lily sent him on the desktop of the computer, but sometimes he would. She looked pretty. I didn't understand why my brother wanted, or felt that he needed to keep his relationship secret.
A few years later, my brother told me that he had broken up with a girlfriend he had. I asked why, but he didn't want to talk about it. I found out what really happened one day while I was using the computer. My brother had saved his last conversation with Lily. It seemed like Lily had lied to my brother. They had met a couple of times in real life, and they seemed to have had a real relationship. The only problem was that Lily already had a husband. My brother was crushed to find out that she was married. On that day I realized that an online relationship is risky. It's up to you to find someone that you can trust and hopefully isn't lying to you. I hope my brother realized that, too.",A2
"Nancy Scott just turned 21 last October. She was excited about finally being able to go to concerts that were strictly 21 and over. She decided that she would go to Las Vegas for her first concert. Jennifer, Nancy's sister, decided to go along with her because she didn't want her sister to go alone and get lost. Jennifer called her friends Matt and Jake, and they all decided to make the drive to Las Vegas.
 
As they arrived in Las Vegas, they parked their car in the parking lot of the hotel they were staying in. Nancy took a shower, and then Jennifer took one. They got dressed and then met both Matt and Jake in the lobby of the hotel. Nancy was so excited; she asked her sister if she wanted to get a drink. Jennifer agreed and said ""OK, but only one."" Jennifer bought her sister a giant drink that came in a four-foot tall cup, and she got the same. Nancy couldn't believe how big the drink was. ""It's almost as tall as me,"" Nancy said. Jennifer laughed and took a drink from her cup.
Matt and Jake arrived first at the place where the concert was going to be. They called the sisters, and told them where to meet them. Nancy was excited to see the concert, because one of her favorite bands was playing. As they got in line to get in, Jennifer went to the restroom. When Jennifer was getting back to her friends and sister, she met one of the members of the band named Jill. Jennifer told Jill about Nancy coming all the way to Las Vegas to see this show, and if she could do something special for her. Jill smiled and said sure. She reached into her purse and gave Jennifer four backstage passes. Jennifer hugged Jill and said thank you. Jennifer ran back to Nancy, and told her to close her eyes. When Jennifer told Nancy to open her eyes, she was holding up the backstage passes in front of Nancy. Nancy began jumping up and down with joy.",A2
"Many studies about language learning ask the question: What makes a good language learner? There are some things that good language learners do and some things they don't do. Here are some of the most useful suggestions from studies.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes. People often get things wrong. Good language learners notice their mistakes and learn from them.
Do group activities. People use language to communicate with other people. A good language learner always looks for opportunities to talk with other students.
Make notes during every class. Notes help you to remember new language. Look at your notes when you do your homework.
Use a dictionary. Good language learners often use dictionaries to check the meaning of words they don't know. They also make their own vocabulary lists.
Think in the language you're learning outside the classroom. When you're shopping or walking down the street, remember useful words and phrases. Sometimes, when you're at home, say new words to practise your pronunciation.
Do extra practice. Test and improve your language, reading and listening skills with self-study material. You can find a lot of this online.
Imagine yourself speaking in the language. Many good language learners can see and hear themselves speaking in the language. This helps their motivation.
Enjoy the process. Good language learners have fun with the language. Watch a TV series or film, listen to songs, play video games or read a book. It's never too late to become a good language learner.",A2
"The big room is air-conditioned. But it smells. Dead bodies are in metal drawers. The bodies have no clothes. The bodies are naked. A white sheet covers each dead body. The drawers slide in. The drawers slide out. A doctor works in the big room with the dead bodies. He works there almost every day. He cuts the bodies open. He cuts them open with a knife. He cuts them open with a saw. He looks at the bodies. He looks inside the bodies. Why did these people die? Why did this young man die, he wonders. He tries to answer the question. Every dead body is a puzzle. The doctor tries to solve the puzzle. Then he tells the police why the people died.",A2
"One of the greatest moments in a young person's life is the day when he or she starts learning to drive. Learning to drive is a rite of passage. It is one of the steps young people take to develop into adulthood. This is a wondrous time full of excitement and expectations. One of the most attractive things about learning to drive is the freedom that comes from operating a vehicle.
 
Once people are able to drive a vehicle, they can go anywhere in the city and beyond. In Southern California, the region was planned and built in a spread-out fashion with miles and miles of freeway access. A new driver no longer needs to rely on others to go somewhere. He or she is now free to go out on their own.
When Michael Allen first learned to drive, he was so excited. He was 16 years old, which in California means he can get a driver's permit. After six months with a permit, he could have a license to drive. Michael had been pestering his father to teach him how to drive for months and now came the big day. His father Edward was a big strong man, who insisted on teaching Michael on a standard transmission car. That meant Michael had to learn how to operate a clutch and gear shifter, which is not easy.
The two began their lessons. Edward was a difficult task-master, and Michael was having great difficulty at first. ""Let the clutch out slowly,"" Edward began yelling every time Michael didn't do it correctly. ""Ease it through. You can do it,"" said Edward to his son. ""I'm trying, dad. I'm trying,"" said Michael. It was not pleasant at first, but soon Michael was driving up and down the block. He was very pleased, and so was his dad. Michael was now a driver.",A2

Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?
This is your bank calling in regards to an overcharge on your credit card.
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
It says here that you charged over $500 on it yesterday.
That can't be right; I have not used it in months!
Are you saying you did not make that charge?
That's exactly what I am saying.
Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.
I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.
This calls for further investigation.
I assure you I did not make the purchase.",A2
"one day, Abel opened his refrigerator and gasped when he noticed there wasn't anything in there. ""Who ate all the food?"" Abel asked his brother Mel, who was in the living room sitting down on the couch watching cartoons. ""You probably woke up in the middle of the night and ate it all!"" Mel humorously responded. Abel was not amused. His stomach was growling and he had no time for Mel's childish quips. ""I'm so hungry! I could eat a horse!"" Abel proclaimed. ""I bet you can easily eat two,"" Mel jokingly said. ""You are so funny,"" Abel sarcastically replied.
 
Abel thought of ordering a pepperoni pizza by phone, but soon realized he had only five dollars. He needed ten dollars to make the purchase. He was short by five dollars. Abel asked his brother if he could pitch in for the rest, but he had no cash. ""Are you even hungry?"" Abel asked Mel. ""I already ate,"" Mel said. This made Abel jealous and a bit angry. ""What did you eat?"" Abel inquired, with furrowed brows. ""A ten-dollar Pizza,"" Mel casually replied. ""You must be kidding,"" Abel said, almost yelling. Mel just sat there watching a recording of an episode from The Simpsons.
""When is mom coming back?"" Abel asked Mel. ""I don't know"" he replied. Abel could now only hope that his mom would come to the rescue and bring a large fresh pizza from Pizza Mountain. Abel plopped down next to Mel on the couch and started watching television with him. They both laughed out loud at the cartoon's funny characters. Abel was enjoying himself so much that he had forgotten that he was hungry. Then commercials began playing. Abel's stomach started calling for food again. ""I'm going to starve to death,"" Abel said, as the front door to his house started opening. ""I'm back, and I brought pizza!"" Abel's mom said as she came in through the door. Abel could not wait to get his hands on the pizza.",A2

"Adrian loves to collect vinyl records. He got his first record from his grandpa. It was a record of Louis Armstrong. His grandpa even gave him a record player to play his records. The only thing Adrian didn't like was that he lived in a small town, so there weren't any stores that sold records. His brother told him to try looking on Craigslist.
 
Adrian looked on Craigslist for people who were selling records of his favorite bands. He had to look for sellers in the nearest city, and found one. His brother went into the city every week. Adrian asked his brother if he could go with him next time. His brother said yes. The person he found was selling his whole record collection for $200. Adrian was excited and took out the money he had been saving. Adrian's brother told him he had read about bad stuff happening to people over Craigslist.
They emailed the guy that was selling the records and told him to meet at a Starbucks. When Adrian and his brother got there, they saw the guy outside of the Starbucks drinking a coffee. He had a box of records with him. The guy told him that it actually wasn't his collection; it belonged to his brother who had passed away. He wanted to sell it to someone who would appreciate them and listen to them every day, like his brother once had. Adrian said that he would play one record a day.
When Adrian got into his brother's car, he started looking through the records. He saw a copy of ""Abbey Road,"" by The Beatles and was happy. When he took the record out, he couldn't believe what he saw. It was autographed by all four members of the band.",A2

"Steven Baker loves his car. He owns a beautiful 1977 Chevrolet Corvette that he bought many years ago. Steve, as he is known to his friends, got a great deal on the car. He bought it from a guy who was the original owner. This is the best possible situation a used car buyer can find. The car culture in California is unique. Detroit automakers look to California for trends to include into their car designs. Many people in California like lower cars, which make them look sleeker and more streamline. This comes from the practice of cruising the boulevard, an activity that is very popular among people of all ages, especially in Southern California.
 
It was Saturday night in August. Steve gave me a call to see what I was doing that night. ""Hey, let's go cruising, brother,"" said Steve. And of course I said yes. I loved cruising in his car. The girls loved that car. It was a two-seater with a T-top roof that is removable. That night we cruised Van Nuys Blvd., a popular street where lots of young people like cruising. This is where guys can meet girls and vice versa. It wasn't long before we spotted a car load of girls in an old Ford Thunderbird. ""Hey!"" I shouted to the girls as we came up near them. ""Anyone want to cruise with us?"" I said, and to my surprise a couple of young blondes jumped in and we drove away. It was a tight fit, but the girls were small and thin. I was in heaven! Before long, I was dating one of them, and Steve dated the other.
We went on a few double dates after that, but Steve and his folks moved away one year later and I never heard from him again. That was a sad day in my life, but at least I had a new girlfriend, thanks to him and his 1977 Corvette!",A2
"There once was a little living doll. She lived inside a doll house that was placed in the corner of a little girl's room. The doll's name was Jane, and the little girl's was Diana. Diana and Jane were best friends. No one else knows that Jane can talk and breathe like anyone else. It was a secret between Jane and Diana.
 
Jane and Diana would play together every day. Sometimes they would play within the doll house. They liked watching movies, playing hide and seek, and painting. They also liked playing outside with toy cars and drawing with chalk on the ground. Since Diana was far too big and Jane far too small, they could not play hide and seek and run over long distances. Instead they enjoyed playing their own version of hide and seek. When they played, it would have to be inside a small room. Jane was always the one to hide since it was easy for her to do so.
One day, it was Diana's birthday, and she had several of classmates from school come over to celebrate. Jane stayed hidden from plain sight in Diana's room. At one point, things became rowdy among some of the boys and girls, and they began to chase each other around the house. Then a few of them entered Diana's room and began invading her things. One of the boys got a hold of Jane who was in her doll house and started to toss and play catch with her among the boys. Then Diana came into the room and took notice of what was happening to Jane and immediately yelled for them to stop. They put Jane back down. Jane was so frightened but relieved to be saved.
""Get out!"" Diana screamed. After everybody left, Diana lifted up Jane and asked her if she was okay. Diana was happy to see that Jane was in one piece. It would be the last time that Diana would bring anyone over to play. This secret was too great to risk its discovery. Nobody could ever know of Jane the living doll.",A2
"When I was 13 years old, I loved playing the drums. I guess banging on the drums gave me an emotional outlet for a very troubled time in my youth. When you're 13, everything seems to come at you from all directions. The drums helped me cope with being a teenager. One day, I called my friend Rudy on the phone. Rudy loved playing around with his guitar. Neither one of us had ever taken music lessons, but we loved our instruments. ""Hey Rudy, why don't you come over? We can play for a while,"" I suggested. ""No problem, man. If it's okay with you, I'll bring my cousin Bobby with me. He plays the bass guitar."" I told him that would be great and waited for them to arrive.
 
Bobby didn't just play the bass, he jammed at it. ""You're really rock on that bass, Bobby,"" I told him. He said he had been playing for years and wanted to form a band. We all looked at each other, and it hit us like a bolt of lightning. ""We can do this!"" Rudy and I said at the same time. ""All we need is a vocalist,"" I said, to which Bobby chirped, ""I can do that, too!"" That was the beginning of the best Rock 'N' Roll band ever - ""The Coke Bottles"". Of course that was an exaggeration, but it turned out we were pretty good for a bunch of novices.
The three of us began meeting at my place every week to practice playing together and to bounce song ideas off each other. Bobby could actually sing. With Rudy and me putting in all those hours of practice, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties and at a free Concert in the Park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got though. Rudy joined the Army the following year. Bobby and I were never able to find another lead guitarist, so the greatest Rock 'N' Roll band ""The Coke Bottles"" never made it big, but that was okay with me. We had our day in the sun.",A2
"Phil grew up in a very poor family in a very poor town. It was pretty bad. Sometimes Phil and his sisters didn't have enough to eat and went to bed hungry. That was okay with Phil though because that was his life, and he thought it was just the way everybody in the world lived.
 
Phil had a lot of fun and had many friends. It wasn't until Phil was about 12 years old that he began to realize that there were better things out there in the world. Phil and his best friend Albert would sit around and talk about getting out of this place to see the world. It was a fantasy, but it was a good fantasy. They really didn't know how they would do it, but they had a dream. Then one day Phil's cousin Ralphie came to visit.
Phil didn't know Ralphie very well. Ralphie grew up in Texas and was about 8 years older than Phil. It had been years since Phil saw his cousin. That day Ralphie changed Phil's life. Ralphie walked into the house wearing his Marine Corp uniform, and Phil knew at that moment that he wanted to become a Marine.
Phil and Ralphie talked all night long. Ralphie told him all about the Corp and Phil was fascinated. Ralphie was wearing his medals and awards, and his uniform was so neat and clean that Phil wanted to join at that moment. Five years later, Phil enlisted in the Marines.

"George is at the pet store, looking at what kind of pet he might want to get for his birthday. George asked if he could have a horse, but his parents said no because horses are too big.
First, he sees dogs and cats. Baby dogs are called puppies. Baby cats are called kittens. George likes them because they are easy to take care of and can play a lot, but they will get bigger. George wants a small pet.
Then George sees animals that have to live in a cage. He sees rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. Mice are what you call more than one mouse. He likes these animals because they are small. Birds live in cages too. George sees a parrot and a canary. He likes them all, but he doesn't want to clean the cage.
George sees the animals in tanks. The tanks full of water have fish and turtles in them. He thinks about a goldfish but decides he likes the turtles more. There are also tanks with rocks and sand that have snakes, spiders, and scorpions, but George is afraid of them. George likes the turtles best, but they won't fit in the little fishbowls. Turtles need bigger tanks, so they can swim sometimes and hide sometimes.
George decides he wants to get a turtle for his birthday. He buys a book on how to take care of a turtle and a list of what types of turtles the store has.",A2
"Maria received a Facebook notification on her mobile phone, which says: ""You have a new message from Jimmy."" Maria didn't know any Jimmy except an ex-boyfriend ten years ago. Maria opened the message and sure enough it was from the man she dated a long time ago.
 
""You should Google me and see what I've been up to,"" the message said. Maria thought the message was strange, but out of curiosity, she typed in Jimmy's full name in the Google search bar. She saw pictures of him and a number of articles. The articles were about him filing for divorce from his wife who was a high school teacher in New York City. She had been accused of having an affair with one of her students. She had been fired and was facing criminal charges. She had a daughter with Jimmy, a successful attorney.
""Is your mind blown?"" Jimmy wrote in a separate Facebook message after a while. Maria didn't know if she should respond. Why was he reaching out to her after so many years? Did he want her to know he was divorced so that they could date again? Maria decided to play along. ""Yes, my mind is blown, and I hope things have settled down for you and your daughter,"" Maria typed. Jimmy didn't respond that night. Maria thought it would be the last time she heard from Jimmy.
A week later Maria received another Facebook notification. It was another message from Jimmy. ""I was hoping that you would have time in your busy schedule to see me,"" the message read. Maria hesitated. When they stopped dating years ago, it was because Jimmy had written a cruel message to her. Should she give him another chance?",A2
"Maria Gonzalez didn't like how technology was slowly taking over everyone's life. She always took the bus to school. Whenever she got on the bus, she would notice that more than half of the people were staring down at their phones. Fewer people were having actual conversations with each other. She felt bad. She thought that this was the reason why people had trouble relating to people in the real world. Everyone was living online now.
 
Maria had trouble making new friends because she hated being on social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. She rarely met new people. She tried going up to people on the bus and starting a conversation, but they always looked at her weirdly. She felt like she was an outsider, and the only one that was not caught in the Internet's web of lies.
One day, while Maria was walking in the park, she saw a girl walking through the park. The girl wore a long, colorful dress, and was always smiling. Maria wanted to talk to this girl. She walked up to the girl and said hello. At first the girl was startled, because she didn't see Maria coming, but then she smiled and said, ""Hello. Do we know each other?"" Maria shook her head and said no. Maria asked her if she wanted to hang out and talk. The girl said sure. Maria and the girl talked for hours. They talked about everything: music, boys, family, food, and their shared distrust of technology. Maria had done something she hadn't done since she was a young girl: she made a new friend in the real world.",A2
"Riding the bus is as easy as pie. The bus driver is there to answer any questions passengers may have. And it only costs one dollar and fifty cents. These were the things Valery had heard from all her friends about public transportation. She had never ridden on the bus alone before. This was about to change in fifteen minutes as she stood waiting at the bus stop at the corner of Atlantic Avenue and 61th Street. Valery had just turned fifteen and was ready to start riding the bus on her own.
 
Valery's mom had sent her to Grandma's house for a weekend stay. She had packed all her belongings in a backpack, and was dressed in her lucky outfit in case she crossed any black cats. She was heading to the city of Montebello where her Grandmother lived. Her heart began racing when she saw the number 260 bus approaching in the distance. She looked around to see if she was alone, but there wasn't anyone else waiting for the bus. She was all alone.
""Come on, you can do this,"" Valery said to herself. She remembered she and her mother had taken the same bus to her Grandma's house the dozens of times. ""It's just like before, except mom is not here,"" Valery said, trying to ease herself. The bus finally came to a halt at its stop, and its doors opened in front of Valery. She took a deep breath, looked at the bus driver, and stepped inside.
Valery put the money into the slot and greeted the bus driver. She then proceeded to the back of the bus and quickly sat down next to an elderly woman. The scariest part was over. ""Now all I have to do is sit and wait until I reached my destination,"" said Valery to herself. ""Don't forget to pull the cord,"" a familiar voice said in her head.",A2
"Michael Hall always loved playing basketball with his brother Scott. They lived next to a park, and they went to play basketball at the park every day. Michael was a junior at his college, and Scott was a freshman. They both tried out for the college team, but were so nervous during the tryouts that they didn't make it. One day, while they were playing basketball, Michael noticed that a guy was watching them play. When Michael and Scott finished playing, the guy who was watching them went up to Michael.
 
""You guys have some skills,"" the guy said. Michael finally realized who the man was. It was Charles King, a famous basketball player. Charles told them that he used to play basketball at that park too when he was younger. Charles asked them if they played for school, or if they had a team with friends. They said they didn't make it into their school's team. ""I never made it into my school's basketball team either,"" Charles said.
Charles asked the brothers if they wanted to play a game of 2 on 1, they happily said yes. Charles won, of course, but he told the brothers that they were really good. Charles then told the brothers that he was starting a basketball camp at his old high school, and if they were interested; they could join it for free. The brothers had heard about it, and said that they would love to join. ""We just have to ask our mother,"" Scott said. Charles laughed, and said, ""Of course, you don't want to get mom mad."" The two brothers ran back home, and they told their mom about what had happened at the park. She told them that they could join as long as they kept up with their homework and their classes. The brothers agreed, and went back to the park to practice.",A2

"Eddie loved to play the guitar. His favorite kind of music to play and listen to was Rock and Roll. Eddie had been playing the guitar since the age of thirteen. He had an older brother who also played the guitar. It was his older brother who first taught him how to play the guitar. Eddie, now seventeen years old, aspired to be a famous musician one day. He knew he could not do this by himself, so he set out on a talent search for someone to play alongside with him.
 
One day Eddie met another guitar player named Jake. Jake was around the same age as Eddie. Both Eddie and Jake shared a similar taste in music. When Eddie asked Jake if he would like to form a band, Jake said yes. ""What's the name of our band?"" Jake asked. Eddie had not thought of a name for the group yet. ""I'm open to any suggestions you might have,"" Eddie said to Jake. The next day, Jake thought of a perfect name. Eddie liked the name as soon as he heard it. From then on, the name of Eddie and Jake's band was Jetsam.
Eddie and Jake started learning how to play songs on their guitars together. Although they both listened to a variety of Rock groups, they focused primarily on learning the songs of their favorite ensemble -- The Beatles. Almost everybody loved The Beatles. Learning to sing and play their songs seemed like the best thing to do.
After learning a handful of songs, Eddie and Jake both felt ready to perform in front of an audience. Eddie and Jake got their acoustic guitars and performed at an open music night at the local community center. The audience roared with thunderous applause after Jetsam's set ended. Eddie and Jake bowed and thanked the audience for coming.

Jennifer loved going out to bowl every Tuesday night. She always liked bowling, but had never joined a bowling league until her friend Paul told her about a new league one day. The two friends enjoyed going to Lucky Lanes on weekends, but had to wait for the league games to finish before they could bowl. It did not bother them since they knew what time the league games were over. Paul talked to the manager of Lucky Lanes one day and discovered that a new league was forming soon. ""That's great,"" said Paul. ""I'm going to ask Jennifer if she wants to join, too,"" added Paul.
 
When Jennifer heard the news, she wasn't as excited as Paul thought she would be. ""What's wrong, Jen?"" asked Paul. ""I just don't know if I'm good enough to play in a league,"" answered Jennifer. ""Don't you have to be a good bowler to bowl in a league?"" Paul thought about it for a while before going back to the manager to ask if the new league was for good bowlers, or anyone could join.
The manager told him that this new league was for beginners, and added that Paul and Jennifer would be some of the best players in the new league. Paul was very excited once again. When he told Jennifer what the manager had said, Jennifer's response was, ""Where do I sign up?"" This made Paul very happy.

"Learning another language is a difficult task, but not impossible. Andrew knew the challenge that lied ahead, but was determined to achieve his goal of learning Spanish. Andrew wanted to learn Spanish because his girlfriend's family was from Guatemala. Andrew had already learned some basic words. Yes in Spanish was si, no was no, and thank you was gracias. It was just a matter of time before he became fluent and began talking to his girlfriend's relatives.
 
Andrew had been receiving lessons from his next door neighbor Jose. Jose was fluent in both Spanish and English. He was born in Mexico, and immigrated to the United States at the age of ten. Jose was happy to teach Andrew Spanish. Andrew insisted on paying Jose for the lessons, even though Jose had offered to do it for free. After a few months, Andrew was able to communicate well enough to hold a simple conversation. Andrew decided to test his Spanish by introducing himself in Spanish to his girlfriend.
""Hola, mi nombre es Andrew,"" Andrew said with a smile on his face. He had said in perfect Spanish, ""Hello, my name is Andrew"". His girlfriend was impressed at his Spanish as they shared a conversation about the weather. Jose's lessons had paid off.
Andrew realized that if he wished to keep progressing in learning Spanish, the best thing to do was to enroll in a Spanish course at the community college. That's exactly what he did the following day. Andrew asked some of his friends if they would like to learn Spanish with him at the community college. ""No, thank you,"" most of them said. Andrew's friends thought it would be too hard to learn Spanish. Little did his friends know, Spanish wasn't that hard to learn. Andrew had learned this firsthand.",A2

Working at a bookstore was a dream job for Joel. He couldn't believe he got hired on the day of his interview. Joel felt grateful to be working at where he was. He loved to brag all about his job to his friends and family.
 
Joel loved reading books on his spare time. His favorite author was Mark Twain. Joel's most beloved book of his was ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"". Working at a bookstore not only gave Joel access to books, but allowed him to interact with other fellow book worms. Joel often would recommend books to customers, and customers would do the same for Joel. Every now and then, he would come across a classic book and take it for himself to read. Joel's manager allowed him one book for free once a week. It was difficult to decide which book to take sometimes.

Since his graduation, he had applied for 20 jobs, yet no one had called him back. Donald decided to be an accountant two years ago, because he figured that it would be an easier way to earn money. Although Donald had studied to become an accountant, his real passion was painting.
 
Donald took some art classes at his university. His teacher told him that he had the talent, but needed to commit more to his painting. Even though Donald was interested, he decided to play it safe and focus his study on becoming an accountant. He passed his art classes as well as his business classes, all with As.

"Ken and Anthony were childhood friends. They went to elementary and high school together. They went to college in different states, and then they lost touch. That was twenty years ago.
 
One morning Ken was reading the newspaper with his morning coffee. Inside he saw an announcement for a poetry reading at a nearby bookstore. He was surprised to find that the featured poet was none other than his friend Anthony. Ken decided to see what his old pal was up to.
Ken sat in the last row of the area set up inside the bookstore. When Anthony was introduced and came up the podium, Ken hardly recognized him. Anthony was almost completely bald and had a little potbelly. When Anthony was in high school, he was very handsome. What Anthony had lost in looks was made up for in talent. Anthony's poetry was quite good.
Anthony recognized Ken sitting in the back row. When the reading was over, Ken stood in line with the others waiting for Anthony to sign a copy of his book. When it was Ken's turn, Anthony stood up and hugged his long lost friend. Anthony invited Ken to stay until he had finished signing books. Ken did, and the two men grabbed a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe.
Even though so many years had passed since the two had seen each other, both men had a lot in common. Both graduated from college with degrees in comparative literature. Both went to graduate school. Anthony got his Master's of Fine Art in writing. Ken went to law school. Both men married Mexican women. Both men divorced. Both men also had sons that were only a year apart.

Subject: Absence from class for two weeks
Attached: doctor's_certificate.pdf
Dear Professor Hart,
I'm writing to let you know that I can't attend class for two weeks as I've had an accident and hurt my back. I'm afraid I also need to ask for an extension for next week's essay.
I have medicine for the pain but I can't get up or walk around much, and the doctor said I should stay in bed and rest as much as possible. This makes reading and studying very difficult for me at the moment. I've attached a copy of the doctor's certificate and I hope to be back in class from 12 May.
Until then, my friend is going to record the lectures so I can listen to them at home. I will try to catch up with all the reading too. However, I don't think I can submit the essay next week. Is it possible to have an extension?
Thank you for your understanding.

"Mildred went to pick up her son Bill from school one afternoon. When she got to the school, Mildred noticed that Bill looked upset. He was pouting and did not want to look at her. ""What's wrong?"" she asked him. ""I got in trouble,"" Bill said in a low voice. ""What happened?"" Mildred asked gently. ""I got put in time-out for grabbing a toy from Mary,"" Bill said.
 
Mildred wasn't sure what a time-out was. She knew that time-outs were called in sports whenever a player was injured but she wasn't sure how that would be used in a kindergarten classroom. Mildred was sure though that her son grabbing a toy from a classmate was not correct. The next day when Mildred took Bill to school, she stopped the teacher. She asked the teacher to explain what a time-out was. Mildred told the teacher that Bill was very upset about the time-out he had the day before. The teacher explained that time-out was a discipline tool she used in the classroom. When she saw Bill grab the toy from Mary, she told him to go into time-out. Time-out is a chair next to the teacher's desk where a student has to sit quietly when they do something wrong.
""They aren't kicked out of the classroom, just taken out of the immediate situation so they can reflect on what they did wrong,"" the teacher explained. Mildred thought it was an interesting way to teach self-control to little kids. ""Can I use this at home?"" Mildred asked the teacher. ""Of course!"" the teacher said.

Ron explained that it was not a garbage can. It was a compost bin. Ron explained that a compost bin was a place where they could put any organic waste, like fallen leaves, grass clippings, and fruit and vegetable peels. ""Why can't we just throw that in the trash?"" Debbie asked. She really didn't want extra work for herself.` Ron explained that it was good for the environment. About 30% of all the garbage in the United States is made up of waste from food and yards. Not only would they produce less garbage, they would also make compost, which was rich soil. It would help Debbie's flowers. She could have the beautiful garden she always dreamed of. Ron explained that little by little inside the bin, the food scraps and green waste would create a pile. The pile would naturally break down.
""Where are we keeping this pile?"" Debbie asked. Ron said the bin would go in the back yard. Debbie wasn't convinced. She was worried about rats and roaches. Ron explained that as long as they didn't put any meat scraps or oily items in the compost bin, then rats wouldn't be a problem. Roaches, however, were a natural part of the materials breaking down.

When James and his family finally arrived at their new home, they decided to go out to meet the neighbors. It was a typical American suburban neighborhood. Every house had a big lawn in the front with a walkway leading up to the door. James felt uncomfortable, and he didn't want to meet the neighbors. The first house they went to belonged to an elderly couple. They seemed nice, but they didn't have any kids that were James's age. The next house they visited had bicycles parked by the garage door, so James thought kids of his age might live there. James knocked on the door, and a young girl named Linda answered. James became nervous, and he let his mother do the talking. Linda's parents weren't home, but she told James's mother that they would go visit when they got home. Linda smiled at James, said goodbye, and closed the door.
As they were walking back to their house next door, James looked back and noticed Linda was looking at him through the window. James looked at her, and Linda smiled. When they got home, James went to his new room. He took a look outside his window, and noticed that he could see Linda in her room. He couldn't help looking at her. He thought she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen. As James was looking at her, he heard his mother calling. ""I'll go downstairs in a moment, mom,"" James said as he turned away from the window. When James looked back to Linda, she was staring right at him. James fell down to the floor, and said in a whisper ""Oh, no. I hope she didn't see me. Oh, please. Please."" Linda saw him, and laughed. She thought James was cute.",A2
"My big brother James has always been a good baseball player. He is six years older than me, but he always invites me to go play catch with him. It's one of my favorite things to do. We live next to a park. Whenever we get bored we just cross the street and start throwing the ball around. The last time we went to the park, we were playing catch and also hitting some baseballs with our bats. Some guys came up to us because they wanted to play a game of baseball. They needed two more players, so they asked us to play with them.
 
James asked me if I wanted to play, and I said yes. The guy's name was Christian, and he introduced us to all the guys. James introduced me and gave the guy our names. I asked Christian if I could play catcher. I always liked playing catcher at school. He said that I could and James got first base. During the game, James got a homerun and I was excited for him. I got on the base twice, but I got out all the time. I was sad, but James told me not to worry and that it happens.
After the game, Christian and the guys told James if he wanted to go grab a drink with them. I thought James was going to go because he likes to drink, but he told them that he was going to take me out to eat. We thanked them for the game and Christian asked James for his phone number just in case they ever needed more players for a game. James gave it to him and then we went to go eat at Jim's Burgers.
I asked James why he didn't go to drink with the guys. He told me that he knew his responsibilities. I didn't know what he meant, but I was glad he didn't go. Now, we could eat burgers and fries.",A2

"Sam was so proud of himself. He had gone two years without smoking a cigarette. At the age of 14, Sam was already puffing away on his favorite brand of cigarettes, Marlboro. Even though people have to be over the age of 18 in America to buy cigarettes, Sam knew of a few stores that sold cigarettes without checking identification. Sam had spent seven years smoking, he was 21 when he decided to quit.
 
Sam decided to quit after discovering he had been coughing blood. He would get tired quickly, and he noticed his teeth were getting really yellow. Whenever Sam would hang out with his friends that smoked, he would always want a cigarette really badly, but was always strong and said no when they offered him one. Before Sam quit, he would go through a pack of cigarettes a week. The pack of cigarettes usually cost him $5.25.
As a way to encourage himself to stop smoking, Sam decided to save his money every week. After two years, Sam took out all his money he had saved from not smoking, and saw that he had saved $504. He decided to buy a bicycle so he could ride it for fun and for exercise. As he started riding his bike more frequently, he noticed that he didn't think about smoking anymore. He didn't want a cigarette when he would hang out with his friends that smoked.
Sam would ride his bike in the morning because he loved getting a breath of fresh air. In the past when he smoked, the only time he got a breath of fresh air was when he went out for a cigarette. He enjoyed being outside breathing in the air that would hit his face as he rode his bike through the town.",A2

"There is a saying ""One man's trash is another man's treasure,"" meaning I might not like something and throw it away, and then someone might love it and take it. I remember seeing a homeless guy searching trash cans looking for something he could sell. I asked him why he did that. He looked at me and said ""One man's trash is another man's treasure,"" which I didn't understand at that time.
 
In fact, he was collecting stuff he needed not only to sell, but stuff he needed to make his home. This man lived in the park by my house. No one really bothered him because he was respectful and would clean up after himself. I went running in the park one day and saw him putting together a bed with stuff he had collected from the trash. He always looked for clean stuff. If it had food trash on it, he wouldn't take it. I went back to my car and took a blanket to him. He saw it and thanked me.
I remember one day the police were bothering him because they had to take away his stuff. The members of the neighborhood went to the police and told them that he wasn't hurting anybody by being there. The homeless man looked at everyone and thanked them, but told the police to take his home away if they had to. ""I know you guys are just doing your job. Go ahead,"" he said.
When the police heard him say that, they decided to leave him alone. He has been there for a couple of years now. He has even started planting a garden outside by the football field. People often go and give him food and other items he might need. He has made trash into his treasure.",A2
"Sharon and Ken just finished a wonderful meal at a fancy restaurant. The service and food were five-star quality. Ken asked for the check. ""How much is the tip?"" Sharon asked. Since she and Ken were just friends, she didn't want him to pay for the whole meal, but since Ken did invite her, she assumed he was paying. Sharon thought that offering to put in the tip was a nice gesture. The tip was not going to be cheap. The meal, complete with a bottle of wine, must have been at least $200. $30 would be 15 percent of a $200 bill, and $40 would be 20 percent of a $200 check. Since the service was good, Sharon had no problem giving a 20 percent tip.
 
Ken told Sharon that there was no need to leave a tip. Sharon was shocked. Maybe Ken didn't think the food was good or maybe he wasn't happy with the service. This surprised Sharon because Ken seemed to enjoy the entire experience and didn't complain. ""Was something wrong?"" Sharon asked Ken. ""No,"" Ken answered. He explained that he felt tipping was just an American way of showing off extra wealth. ""I think it's vulgar and disrespectful,"" he continued.
Sharon knew that Ken wasn't born in the United States and wondered if that had something to do with how Ken felt. ""Well, in the United States, tipping is kind of expected. Servers generally aren't paid that well and rely on tips to feed their families. The exception of course is if the service was really bad, but I had a lovely time. Didn't you?"" Sharon asked. ""Service was great,"" Ken agreed, ""but why don't they just pay the servers better so we don't have to pay more?"" Sharon agreed with Ken, but she still left a 20 percent tip.",A2

His first class is English, and he likes that teacher very much. His English teacher says that he is a good pupil, which Lucas knows means that she thinks he is a good student.
His next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas likes art. It is his favorite class.
His third class is science. This class is very hard for Lucas to figure out, but he gets to work with his classmates a lot, which he likes to do. His friend, Kyle, works with Lucas in science class, and they have fun.
Then Lucas gets his break for lunch. He sits with Kyle while he eats. The principal, or the headmaster as some call him, likes to walk around and talk to students during lunch to check that they are all behaving.
The next class is mathematics, which most of the students just call math. Kyle has trouble getting a good grade in mathematics, but the teacher is very nice and helpful.
His fourth class is gym. It is just exercising.
History is his last class of the day Lucas has a hard time staying awake. Many lessons are boring, and he is very tired after doing gym.",A2
"Patricia was happy that she was finally making friends since moving to Los Angeles from New York. She had left everything behind to move to be closer to her boyfriend. The first friend she made was Helen. Helen worked with Patricia at a clothing store in the local shopping mall. Sometimes Patricia would even see Helen on the freeway when they were working the same shift. Patricia thought that they must not live too far from one another. Helen confirmed this.
 
""My neighborhood is right next to yours,"" Helen told Patricia while they were both checking out customers. ""Drop by anytime you want on a day when we're both not working,"" Helen said. Patricia took the invitation too literally. She was able to get Helen's address from their manager at work. ""I want to surprise my new friend,"" Patricia told the manager. The manager thought that was sweet and without thinking about Helen's privacy, he passed the address onto Patricia. On a day that Patricia and Helen both had the day off, Patricia looked up Helen's address on her map application on her cell phone. Helen's house was only 10 minutes away.
Patricia followed the directions, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the doorbell at 2374 Evergreen Avenue. It took Helen awhile to answer the door. She looked genuinely surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia on her doorstep. ""What are you doing here? How did you get my address?"" Helen asked. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was a mess. ""You told me to drop by anytime we both had a day off, so I got your address from our manager. I want to give you a surprise!"" Patricia said.

"Jaime, a new immigrant, was attending his daughter's first performance in a school play. His daughter, Carol, was five years old. She was a kindergarten student at the local public school. Carol did not have a very big role in the school play. She was playing a rain cloud in a play about the drought in California. Carol had one line. Her line was, "" I am sad enough to cry about how dry the state is.""
 
Jaime and his wife made sure to arrive early so that they could get a good seat in the auditorium. They secured seats in the front row. Before the show began, the school principal made an introductory speech. The speech was about how hard the students and teachers worked together to make the play possible. At the end of the speech, the principal said, ""Let's give the school staff a hand"".
Jaime, whose English was not very good, stood up when the principal said this. He knew that when people said ""to give someone a hand"" they meant they needed help. Jaime always wanted to help, especially at his daughter's school. Jaime thought maybe they needed help backstage.
Jaime's wife put her arm in front of her husband. ""Where are you going?"" she whispered. ""They need a hand,"" Jaime whispered back. His wife explained that ""to give someone a hand"" could also mean to applaud someone. ""They don't need help. They just want us to clap,"" Jaime's wife said. Jaime felt a little embarrassed. He sat back down and began clapping along with the rest of the audience.
Jaime thought to himself that someone needed to give the English language a hand. How could one phrase mean two different things? He meant the English language needed help.",A2
"This is how Josh met his first girlfriend. He was 12 years old and in the seventh grade. He had known Diana since she was a little girl, but he was shy and never talked to her. She was very pretty, and Josh was afraid to say anything to her because he thought she wouldn't like him. Josh had no self-confidence when he was a kid. He finally got the courage to talk to her one April day.
 
The school was right on a busy street, so a crossing guard helped students cross to the other side. The guard carried a sign over his head that said ""Stop"" so that cars would not hit anyone. The rule was that no one could cross the street without the guard, so everyone always waited. One day Josh got to the corner and the crossing guard was gone, so he decided to cross the street alone. That's when he heard ""Hey! You're not supposed to cross the street alone!"" It was the crossing guard. Josh didn't see him because the guard was behind a bush tying his shoes. Josh was so scared. From that day on, he decided to go all the way around the block to avoid seeing the guard. He knew the guard would report him to the school.
What happened next was something he could not believe. It turned out Diana went around the block too, but Josh didn't know that then. He accidentally ran into her one day and they started to talk. One thing led to another, and soon Josh was looking forward to going home the long way. They started walking together and Josh discovered Diana was just as shy as he was!

He joined the Navy after graduation. now that I was out of high school, he came back specifically to talk to me about my plans. I had no idea he was coming because he wanted it to be a surprise, and it sure was.
""Okay, now that you're out of high school, what are you going to do with your life?"" he asked. To tell the truth, I didn't have a clue. Most of my classmates knew exactly where they wanted to go to college, or if they were going to join the military. Some of them were like me - clueless. No one had ever been interested enough in me to try to give me some guidance except Eddie. He told me about college and I should consider going to a community college since I hadn't applied to a four-year university. I was very interested, but confused. ""You never went to college, Eddie. How do you know it's the right thing to do?"" I asked. Eddie just smiled and said he just knew and that I needed to trust him on this one.
Since I trusted him like a brother, I took his advice and enrolled in a community college. It's been quite an experience. I must admit, Eddie was right. I will be transferring to UCLA next semester and things are looking up for me. I owe it all to my ""big brother"" Eddie.

"Michelle was tired after a long day at work. She just wanted to get home, order a pizza for dinner, and go to bed. As she sat on the train home, she closed her eyes. Suddenly she heard music. It was a harmonica playing a sad song. It sounded like a blues song. She opened her eyes to look where the sound was coming from. Was it from someone's iPod with the volume up loud?
 
The sound was coming from a man leaning against the subway doors playing a harmonica. When he finished playing the song he walked up and down the aisles with a cup in his hand asking for tips. Michelle didn't feel like this was fair. While the music wasn't unpleasant, it's not like she had a choice. She was forced to listen to it since she has to take the train home from work.

""You shouldn't encourage that,"" Michelle told one of her fellow commuters after he dropped some change in the man's cup. ""I don't even think it's legal for him to play music in the train and ask for money,"" Michelle said. She then scanned the advertisements and notices inside the train car. Sure enough she found a sign that said playing music and soliciting was not allowed and that there would be a fine for people caught by the police.

"Jerry was seventeen when his family decided to move out their apartment in the city of Riverdale. They had lived there for nearly ten years. In those ten years, Jerry had made dozens of friends from around the city. He didn't understand why they had to move. Jerry wished he could stay behind while his family left to Arizona. He knew things weren't ever going to be the same if he left Riverdale, California.
 
""Why do we have to move?"" Jerry would ask, sounding depressed. His parents had answered that question countless times already. Despite knowing the answer, Jerry was reluctant to believe it, so he kept asking. ""Why do we have to move?"" Jerry asked time after time.

On the day before the move, Jerry walked around the familiar places in Riverdale. He walked passing the oak tree where he first kissed a girl. He walked past the corner mini-market where he would bring back milk every Sunday. He passed by his high school where he had learned and discovered his love of math and science.

"Spring finally arrived. This past winter was a long, cold, and snowy one. Gonzalo was ready to get outdoors and play some sports. However, since Gonzalo was new in town, he didn't have that many friends. He decided to try and get some of his co-workers together. In the company lunchroom he put up a paper. The paper invited people to meet Gonzalo at a nearby park on Saturday for a game of football. Football was Gonzalo's favorite sport. He played it ever since he was a kid.
 
On Saturday morning, Gonzalo was excited to go to the park with his new friends to play some football. He was a little worried that people wouldn't show up. Gonzalo walked to the park early. He wanted to be the first one there to meet everyone. He packed his cleats and a ball in a backpack.
Gonzalo waited in an open field close to the entrance to the park. That way everyone could see him. He would also be preventing others from taking the space. Slowly but surely, Gonzalo's coworkers began coming into the park. Some of them even brought friends and family from outside of work. Gonzalo was certain they would have a great game.
""I brought a ball,"" Gonzalo told one of his coworkers Leo, who said he had also brought a ball. Leo said he was a huge football fan. Sometimes Leo even held parties at his house to watch football. Both Leo and Gonzalo went to their backpacks to get their balls. That's when they realized there had been a miscommunication.
Leo's ball was oblong and brown, while Gonzalo's ball was a round soccer ball. Gonzalo had forgotten that in the United States football and soccer were different sports. Leo had forgotten that, too. They compromised and played one game of soccer and one game of American football.",A2

So, at the family reunion, it was no surprise to see that Paul was sitting alone at a table where no one was sitting at. Occasionally, an aunt or uncle of his would come up to say hello, but none of his cousins ever said hello to him. Paul was fine with it; he didn't care, because he didn't like talking to them, either.
 
During his last family reunion, Paul decided to play a trick on his cousins. His cousins had been playing Nintendo in his uncle's room. Paul knew how to turn off all the power in the house. He locked the door to his uncle's room, and then went to turn off the power. When all the lights turned off, he could hear his cousins begin to yell. They were upset because the game was going really well.
When his cousins tried to leave, they realized that the door was locked. They began to yell for help, and Paul started laughing. All of his aunts and uncles were outside enjoying the party, so no one could hear the yells. Paul went back outside and sat down at a table. He was still laughing. An hour passed, and his aunt started looking for her son. When Paul's cousins were finally set free from the room, they started looking for Paul, because they knew he had locked them in there. Paul wasn't worried; he knew they wouldn't do anything. He looked at them, laughed, and then went back to listen to music. The cousins sat down, and got something to eat. They were all mad at Paul.",A2
"Monday was the day of the big test. Luella had three days left to study. She knew she had to study for at least three hours per day in the next couple of days if she hoped to get the grade she wanted. Luella needed to score at least a ninety percent in her test in order to pass her Algebra class with an A.
 
The stakes were high for Luella. She had attended every lecture this semester. She had jotted down notes upon notes to take home and study. She had even sat in a few tutoring sessions after class. After turning in all her homework and passing all her quizzes, Luella still felt like she could fail her final test. After all, it was cumulative, meaning the test would test her on everything she had learned.
Luella knew what she had to do. It was time to buckle down and study like there was no tomorrow. Motivated and determined, Luella sat at her desk and studied for at least three hours for the next three days. By the time the night before the test came, Luella felt confident that she would do well.
Luella woke up that Monday morning with a grin on her face. She had dreamed of taking the test. In the dream she passed her test with an A. It was up to Luella to make her dream come true that Monday morning. Luella was assured she would. She knew all that studying was about to pay off as she walked into her classroom and sat down at her desk. ""Nothing can go wrong,"" Luella said to herself.
She was right! Luella not only breezed through all the math problems, but was the first person to finish in her class. Luella knew she could do it. It was of no surprise when she discovered the grade she received. It was an A plus.",A2
"Disneyland is also called Magic Kingdom. It is located in Anaheim, California. The park opened in 1955, and was an instant success. When Anthony Martinez was a little boy, his brothers and sisters told him about Disneyland. At first, Anthony didn't know what they meant. He was just too young, and would call it ""Dizzyland"" as he couldn't pronounce it properly. His father had taken his older siblings to the park many times, but that was years ago. Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.
 
For a long time, Anthony kept asking his parents to take him to Disneyland, but the feeling eventually wore off. He quit bugging his parents to take him. One day, when Anthony was about 8 years old, a classmate came to school bragging about his weekend at Disneyland. All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go again. ""Please, mommy, take me to Disneyland,"" Anthony pleaded to his mom. His dad heard it, and immediately told him ""Okay, son, we're going this weekend for sure."" Anthony's dad hadn't realized that his youngest child had never been there, and felt very bad about it.
The weekend came, and Anthony was so excited. He couldn't keep still. When they got into Disneyland, Anthony marveled at the castles and other attractions. He especially liked the life-sized characters that roamed the park. He grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Now he was taking pictures with them. Anthony was ""in heaven.""
The best part of the theme park is the rides. ""Can we go on the Captain Nemo Ride?"" That question was soon followed by ""Can we go on the Matterhorn?"" Soon Anthony had gone on just about every ride. He was overwhelmed by the place. Soon the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. It was the greatest day of his young life. A day he would later call ""the best day of my life."".",A2
"Some of the most popular places to visit during summer are the beaches. Kenneth Green loved going to beaches. He lived close to Venice Beach, and could walk to the beach in 30 minutes. He could smell the ocean whenever he woke up. Kenneth and his friends decided to go to the beach the first day of the summer. When they got there, they found it was filled with tourists and people trying to escape the heat.
 
Even though the beach was filled with people, Kenneth didn't care. He knew all the cool places to go. He was friends with some shop owners. He was also friends with the owners of a little Mexican restaurant. He had a little booth reserved for him during the summer so that whenever he got hungry he didn't have to wait for a table. The owners were family friends of Kenneth and they loved having him around. Kenneth didn't like to abuse their relationship, so he only went to the restaurant once or twice a week, and he always left good tips.
There are a lot of activities to do at the beach. People can go swimming, rent a bike, play volleyball, or shop around. Kenneth is always careful when he is around volleyball nets and people bicycling. Last year, he was walking by the volleyball nets when a large man jumped up to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right in the head. The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay. He was okay, but a bit dizzy. As Kenneth was trying to get his balance back, he walked right into the path of a bicycle. He crashed into a woman riding a bicycle, and they both fell down. It wasn't Kenneth's favorite summer.",A2

"Mary and Tom became fast friends after their nightly meet-up. Every night at seven o'clock, Tom would pick up Mary at her house and the two would walk Buddy around the neighborhood for about an hour. Mary no longer walked Buddy alone at night, and Tom no longer followed Mary.
 
One night, as they were walking Buddy, Mary and Tom decided to grab a bite to eat because they were hungry. ""Where do you want to eat?"" Tom asked Marry. ""Let's go to Pizza Mountain,"" she replied. ""I don't feel like eating pizza right now,"" Tom said. ""Do you have any suggestions?"" Mary asked. ""How about going back to my house? I'll cook our own food!"" Tom said. Mary thought this was a great idea. The two headed back to the street where they lived and thought about what to cook on the way.
When they arrived, they had decided on making hamburgers. Mary wrote down a list of ingredients they were going to need to make the hamburgers. Tom went to the refrigerator and took out all the ingredients that he had. ""Where are the buns?"" Mary asked when she saw they were missing. ""I'll run to the market and get some hamburger buns,"" Tom said. By the time Tom came back from the market, Mary had prepared the food. All they needed to do now was to put the food between the buns.
Mary and Tom were about to take their first bites into their burgers when Buddy came in through the door wagging his tail and salivating. ""I think he wants a burger,"" Tom said. Mary rose from her seat and made a burger for Buddy. Buddy ate the burger in one bite as soon as Mary handed it to him.",A2
"David must have been the only kid in America that did not like summer vacation. Every year, between the beginning of June through the end of August, school kids were on vacation. Only to David, summer vacation meant work, work, and more work!  His dad was a workaholic. He had two jobs most of the time. He had one job during the day and the other at night, but sometimes he worked on weekends, too. The man had more energy than any persons alive. When he wasn't working on weekends at his third job, he worked at home and that was why David hated summer vacation.
 
His dad was always building something, or tearing something down. If he wasn't tearing down a wall, or adding a new room to the house, he was putting in a new driveway or garage. It was living hell for a 13-year-old kid. While all of David's friends were off playing baseball or riding their bicycles, he was usually hauling bricks or mixing cement. That's what he remembers about his childhood.
David always knew he was in trouble whenever he heard ""Where's David!"" His dad's voice seemed to carry down the street. That phrase could only mean it was time to get to work. Of course David learned throughout the years how to make himself disappear at just the right times, but his dad usually found him anyway. ""But dad, I want to go to the park to play with my friends,"" David would say. ""You can waste time with your buddies some other time. It's time to get to work now,"" his dad would respond. It got so bad that David would intentionally fail classes so he would have to go to summer school. Summer school was for students who didn't do well during the regular school year, but he didn't care. It meant less work. It meant freedom!

"Betty Gonzalez likes going to the movies. She likes to wait until there are multiple movies she wants to see. She'll usually go early in the day in order to see at least two movies. Betty is proud that her record is seeing four movies in one day. She usually sneaks in snacks to eat at the movie theater. Betty doesn't care if no one wants to go with her; she'll go alone and have fun.
 
It was Saturday morning. Betty saw that there were three movies she wanted to see showing at the theater. Betty got her purse and made herself two sandwiches, bought a soda, got her sweater, and went to the movies. After she had seen two of the movies, she bought a soda and was going to sneak into the next movie. As Betty walked up to the room where the movie was showing, she noticed that a man was checking for tickets. Betty began to get nervous.
Betty didn't have a ticket, but she really wanted to see this movie. She did not like the other two movies; she knew she was going to like this one, because her favorite actor was in it. The man that was checking for tickets stopped Betty as she tried to pass him. He asked her for her ticket. Betty didn't know what to do. The man was speaking in English, so Betty decided to speak in Spanish.
She told the man something in Spanish, and then walked off while she was still talking. The man was confused, and he didn't know what to do. Betty looked like she was mad at the man, so he didn't want to do anything else to get her even angrier. He just let her go through. When Betty got to her seat, her heart was still beating fast. She started laughing. She took a sip of soda and watched the movie in peace.",A2
"Rocky was a big baseball fan. He lived in Philadelphia, but was originally from Los Angeles. He made sure to go watch the Dodgers every time they played the Phillies. Rocky will never forget the last game he saw at Citizen's Bank Ballpark, which is where the Phillies play.
 
It started off as a normal game for Rocky. He sat out in the stands with his girlfriend. He was fully dressed as a Dodgers fan. He had a Dodgers hat, jersey, and shirt. As the game came to the seventh inning, which is the seventh inning stretch and everyone starts singing ""Take me out to the Ballpark,"" he noticed that the Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett had been pitching a no-hitter. A no-hitter is when a pitcher doesn't allow a player on the other team to get a hit. Rocky got excited, because he never would have thought he would see a no-hitter, especially the Dodgers pitch a no-hitter.
Rocky was holding on to his beer, but he wasn't drinking it. He was watching the baseball game very closely. His girlfriend would talk, but he wouldn't listen. As Beckett threw the final pitch, Rocky held his breath. He saw that it was a strike and jumped out of his chair. He even spilled some of his beer on his girlfriend, but she didn't care. She was happy as well. Rocky was thrilled. He started yelling loudly. He celebrated with other Dodger fans that were there and drank the rest of his beer.
When he got home, Rocky turned on the television. He put the highlights of the game on ESPN and saw that he had come out on television. His girlfriend saw it and was excited. It was the best ending to the best baseball game he had ever been to.",A2

""Hello, my name is Steven. I've seen you here before,"" he said. ""Oh, hello. My name is Claudette. I always come here to study and wait for my dad. I live a bit far,"" she said.

"It was a hot day in Clarksville. The children in the neighborhood were sweating, and wanted to do something refreshing. The pool was closed because they were building something new in it. They thought about what they could do to escape the heat, but they never could agree on doing the same thing. That's when Christopher Baker decided to go to the store. He bought 10 bags of balloons, and went to his house to fill them up with water. He invited his two best friends Joseph and Patrick to help him out. By the time they finished, they had five buckets of water balloons.
 
They went outside with the buckets, put them in the center of Joseph's lawn, and started throwing them to the children in the neighborhood. At first, the other children were surprised, but then they wanted to get wetter. They all went to the store and bought some balloons for themselves. Christopher and his friends went back into the house to make more balloons. When they get back outside, they got attacked with 10 different water balloons.
Christopher and his friends started laughing when they realized where the other boys were. They decided to hide. Christopher gave the orders to his friends. He told Joseph to hide behind his dad's car; he told Patrick to hide behind his mom's car. They each took four water balloons with them. Christopher told them to wait for his signal, and then they could throw the balloons.
Christopher knew where three of the boys were hiding, so he went running and attacked them with five water balloons. Christopher then ran back to the place where he was hiding, but the boys were coming after him. Christopher yelled out, ""Now!"" Joseph and Patrick came out of hiding and attacked the boys with their water balloons. The boys went back. Christopher and his friends started laughing.

"I had the worst birthday of my life last year. It all started when my sister Donna invited my ex-girlfriend Jennifer. For some reason, Donna and Jennifer started getting along after we broke up. ""How convenient,"" I told Jennifer. Donna was always trying to make my life hell. I guess that's her job as the older sister. She was 20 years old, while I turned 17 years old last year.
 
My mother had worked very hard to keep the party they were going to throw for me a secret. It didn't work, because Donna had a big mouth, but I was trying to keep up the secret for my mother's sake. My dad got home from work and told my mom to get the kids so that we could all go out for dinner.
We showed up at my favorite restaurant, which has a private room in the back for parties. Everything went downhill as soon as I opened the door. My other ex-girlfriend Sarah was there, because she wanted to try and fix our relationship. I'll never forget the look on Donna's eyes. She looked like she saw a ghost. Donna grabbed Jennifer and told her to go outside. Jennifer and Sarah never got along. It might have something to do with me, but I'm not sure.
Jennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had the chance. I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. She looked at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week ago. It was true. I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. When Jennifer finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. She looked at me and started yelling at me. ""Why is she here, Jason?"" asked Jennifer. I looked at her equally angry and said, ""What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here?"" Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. They got so angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant. My mother was crushed when she got there. Donna got grounded for a month.

"Frank just moved from an apartment into a small house with his family. When he lived in a six-story apartment building, dealing with the trash was easy. Frank usually just dropped a bag of garbage down a trash compactor chute. There was one trash compactor chute on every floor of the building. The chute was in a small room located next to the elevator. Frank had to take cans, bottles and other recyclables to the basement and put them in a special bin. He did not though have to worry about remembering what day was trash day. He did not have to worry about taking the trash out to be collected. That was the job of the building's superintendent.
 
The two-bedroom house Frank moved into had no superintendent though. Frank was provided with three trashcans by the city. Each trashcan was a different color. The black one was for regular garbage. The blue one was for paper, plastic, and cans so that they could be recycled. The green bin was for leaves, cut grass, and tree trimmings. Each bin needed to be put out to the curb before the city sanitation trucks came around early Monday morning. Frank couldn't put the cans out too early, either. If he put the cans on the curb before 6:00 p.m. on Sunday evenings, he could get a ticket and have to pay a fine.
Frank decided to set a reminder on his cell phone. Every Sunday night at 6:00 in the evening his phone would beep reminding him to take the trash bins to the curb. Frank also had to pay the city every three months for trash collection. That was something that he didn't have to do when he rented an apartment. Living in a house sure involved a lot more responsibility than living in an apartment building.

"When Johnny was a kid, all he talked about was becoming a baseball star. Of course he wasn't alone. Most young boys growing up in the United States want to become a major league baseball player at one time or another. He remembers watching his favorite players on TV when he was young, and how his father would take him to see the Giants play at Candlestick Park.
 
Johnny recalls the old stadium, and how big it seemed to him as a child. His dad took him onto the field one day when the team was having a photo day. Johnny couldn't believe how big the field was. All his favorite Giants were there taking pictures with fans. ""Can I take a picture with Willie Mays' dad,"" Johnny asked gleefully. ""Of course, Johnny. Let's get in line,"" said his dad. Willie Mays was one of the greatest players to ever play the game, and he loved kids, too. That is why the line to take a picture with him was so long. Johnny didn't mind though. He was in baseball heaven.
The Giants played their archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, that day. There had always been a bit of bad blood between the two teams over the years. It started when both teams were based in New York. They were cross-town rivals at that time. After the teams moved to California in the late 1950s, the rivalry continued.
The Dodgers were always one of the better teams in the National League, and even though Johnny grew up a Giants fan, he really didn't hate the Dodgers. ""I think the rivalry was blown up, to tell the truth,"" Johnny said years later. Baseball fans are very fickle and stubborn though, and some play the rivalry up as much as they can. No true Dodger, or Giant fan would ever admit liking the other team in public, but Johnny suspects there is a mutual respect for each team in both cities.",A2

My last holiday was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic. I know Prague well because I lived there when I was at university, more than ten years ago.

They still send emails and text messages to each other to keep in contact, but she already felt their friendship falling apart.
 
Recently, a new family had moved into the house where her friend used to live in. It was a family of four, a married couple with two children. One of the children was a five-year-old boy, and the other was a girl who was one year older than Sandra. Sandra's mother and father had gone over to introduce themselves as neighbors.

"A great American tradition dating back to the birth of the country is the board game night. This is where two or more families get together at someone's home to have dinner, and refreshments, and then play games. This is an activity where almost anyone can play. Most board games can be played by children as young as 6, or 7 years old. It is fun for the kids to test their skills against their older brothers and sisters, or their parents. One of the oldest and most popular board games is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from square to square.
 
Little Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play. ""Please, mommy. Please let me play with you tonight,"" he pleaded. His mom thought about it for a while, and said, ""Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play."" She really didn't think he was going to be able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The object of the game is to bankrupt your opponents and have most money at the end of the game. You buy properties with money collected by moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more property you can buy.
Johnny landed on the Boardwalk square, which is a very prized property. It is the most expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is positioned at the end of the game where everyone collects $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent. Johnny bought a couple of nearby properties too, and before long, he was collecting rent from all the other players. Johnny ended up winning the game, which made him very happy, and it also made his mom very proud of him. Johnny showed her and everyone else what he was capable of.",A2
"Albert had been playing the guitar almost all his life. His first guitar was given to him by his father. It was a Fender Stratocaster, and Albert absolutely loved it. As a young boy, Albert would spend hours and hours listening to songs trying to learn them on his guitar.
 
As he grew older, he didn't play the guitar as much. He met a girl and they started dating. Eventually they had a son. Every once in a while, Albert would take out the old Fender Stratocaster and play a song for his baby son named Max. He loved playing guitar for Max, because it would calm him down when he started crying. As Max got older, he started listening to the same kind of music his father listened to.
Albert and his son would listen to music together and talk about what they thought the songs meant. During Max's tenth birthday, Albert gave his son a Fender Stratocaster as well. The same model his father had gotten him. It cost him a bit more, but he wanted his son to have the same one as his. Max was happy, he asked his dad to teach him all the songs he knew. Albert smiled and said, ""Of course!""

One day Elizabeth stayed home from work because she was expecting a package. When she woke up that morning, the apartment smelled fine. At one in the afternoon, Elizabeth went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for lunch. That was when she noticed the smell of cigarette smoke. She called the building's superintendent. By the time he arrived at Elizabeth's apartment, the whole place smelled like cigarette smoke. The super told Elizabeth he was pretty sure the smoke was coming up though the vents from her new downstairs neighbor. The new neighbor was a smoker. The super told Elizabeth there was nothing to be done. The building was really old and the vents couldn't be sealed. It was also perfectly legal for the downstairs neighbor to smoke in his apartment. He suggested that Elizabeth buy an air filter and see if that would help.
Elizabeth bought an air filter but didn't find it to be enough. Her asthma was getting worse. Her clothes and furniture were beginning to smell like cigarette smoke, too. Elizabeth decided to go downstairs to talk to the neighbor. She was going to ask him not to smoke in his apartment. Elizabeth knocked on the door. When he opened the door, a huge wave of cigarette smoke came out. Elizabeth began coughing violently. The neighbor gave Elizabeth a disgusted look. ""Are you trying to get me sick?"" the neighbor asked her. Elizabeth couldn't believe what he was saying. ""No, but you are,"" she said.",A2
"Going to an all-boy high school was no fun. Joe's parents thought it would be a good idea to send him there instead of a public school because ""He would get distracted by girls,"" as his mom would say. Once, during his third year, Joe begged his mom to let him go to public school. ""I just want to be normal,"" he would tell her. ""I want to meet girls. I don't want to be weird."" But his words always fell on deaf ears. Mom always said that Joe had plenty of time to go on dates after high school, and that he needed to concentrate on his school work.
 
This usually made him very sad, but like a good kid, Joe just nodded his head and went on with his studies. That all changed one day when Joe met Carmen, who lived just two blocks away from him. One day he ran into her at the market by chance. They had gone to kindergarten together. They were also of the same age. She was in Joe's class, and she remembered Joe, too.
After about two weeks, they were going steady. Joe was so happy, but had to hide his relationship from his parents, which was okay because Carmen was hiding him from her family, too! ""Are you kidding me?"" Carmen said, ""They would kill me if they knew I had a boyfriend!""  Everything was going great for a time, but Joe's mom was right. His grades started slipping, and he soon was on academic probation because he was spending too much of his free time with Carmen. She also dropped a grade or two. As a result, both of them had to go to summer school to improve their grades, but Joe didn't care. He was in love and that was all that mattered at the time. Much later, he came to realize his mom was right.

"School was over for the year. This meant that the school's after-school program, which kept Adriana's daughter June in school until she was done with work, was also over. The after-school program was convenient because June didn't have to leave the school. Adriana didn't have to worry about her daughter being home alone. The after-school program also made sure that June did her homework. This made Adriana's job as a single mother so much easier. All she had to worry about when she picked her daughter up from school was dinner.
 
One of the best things about the after-school program was the cost. It only cost 30 dollars a month. The school did not offer a summer program. Adriana did not have a summer vacation from work so she needed to find a program that would watch June while she was working. Hiring a private babysitter was too expensive.
Another mom from June's school gave Adriana information about a local recreational center that was offering a summer program for school-age kids. The program was not as expensive as other summer camp programs, but was more expensive than after-school cost though. The summer program cost 50 dollars per week. Adriana didn't know how she could afford the program.
June didn't understand the sacrifices her mother had to make for her. She was just excited to attend the summer program. She had never been in summer camp before. June was especially excited because her friends would be there with her. Sometimes summer was boring especially since her mom worked all day. June heard there would be games and crafts. She was going to make something nice for her mom to thank her.",A2
"Maggie was meeting her friend Lisa at a French restaurant downtown for lunch. Lisa was visiting New York from Chile. They met in Chile over 10 years ago. That was the time when Maggie spent a semester abroad as part of her undergraduate studies. Lisa was a Chilean student who helped Maggie learn Spanish and how to play soccer. Even when Maggie came back to the United States, the two friends kept in touch with each other via Facebook and Skype.
 
Maggie waved to Lisa from the table in the restaurant when she saw her Chilean friend walk in. Lisa looked the same, just a little older and a little fatter. ""Tell me what is new with you?"" Maggie asked Lisa. Lisa explained that she worked for an airline and was in town on business. ""I get to travel all the time now,"" Lisa told Maggie. ""Oh, really?"" Maggie replied. ""Yes really, and I can even sometimes get tickets for friends and family members at really low prices,"" Lisa continued. ""Oh, really?"" Maggie replied. Maggie was annoying Lisa. Lisa was beginning to feel like Maggie didn't believe what she was saying. ""I can show you the memo from my job that explains it all if you don't believe me,"" Lisa said angrily. ""Why wouldn't I believe you?"" Maggie asked and confused. She thought it was great that Lisa had a job that took her all over the world, and that even let her do it with friends and family.
""Well, you keep saying 'oh, really?' like you are challenging what I'm saying,"" Lisa said. Maggie explained that when she said ""oh really"", it just meant she found what Lisa was saying interesting and wanted her to elaborate. ""Oh, really?"" Lisa said before the two friends both burst out laughing.",A2
"""You're a Winner!"" That's what Helen Green read as she opened an envelope she got in the mail. She couldn't believe it. She had won. Helen's husband Roger came over to see why Helen was screaming and jumping. Helen told Roger ""You're not going to believe it. Your sister entered us in a sweepstakes for a Hawaii vacation, and we won. We won, Roger!"" Roger didn't believe it at first, but then he researched it. ""Well, I guess we're going to Hawaii, honey,"" he told Helen. They both started jumping with joy.
 
Helen and Roger arrived at Hawaii, and couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked. They had been married for 20 years, but had never had a vacation. After they had checked into their hotel room, they decided to go to the beach. They met a surfer named William, although he liked to be called Will, who was offering free lessons. Seeing that Roger had always wanted to learn how to surf, they decided to go. Will explained to Roger how to paddle the surf board, and he taught him how to stand up on it. After two hours of training in the sand, Will told Roger that they would go out to the water. Roger didn't like that.
""Where are we going?"" Roger nervously asked. ""Over there,"" said Will, as he pointed to the ocean. He started getting nervous, and started breathing heavy. Helen went over to Roger and calmed him down. ""They're probably in their honeymoon,"" people said as they passed Roger and Helen. Roger laughed. He finally calmed down. He went out to the ocean with Will, and tried to surf. Every time he tried to get on the surf board he ended up falling. When they got back to the land, Helen hugged Roger and kissed him. ""You did great, honey. I love you,"" Helen said. Roger knew she was lying, but he had never seen Helen smile so greatly. He let it go.",A2
"When William was transferred to a job in Texas, he was really worried about making friends. On his first day in the factory though, everyone was really friendly. You should join our softball league,"" his co-worker Richard suggested. ""That's a great idea, thanks, but I don't have a bat or a glove,"" William said to Richard. Richard jotted down on a piece of paper the name and address of a local sports supply shop nearby. ""They will have everything you need,"" Richard said.
 
On his day off, William went to the sports shop. ""Boy, Rich wasn't kidding,"" William said to himself. Not only did they have bats and gloves, but also equipment for all kinds of sports. The store also featured an extensive gun selection. ""Those are toy guns?"" William asked. The salesperson shook his head. ""No, sir. These are all working weapons. I have some machetes and knives too if you want something more traditional,"" the salesperson explained.
""No, I just came in for some softball equipment,"" William told the salesperson. ""Well, you can take home any of these lovely rifles or guns along with your softball equipment today,"" the salesperson continued. ""I don't need a license?"" William asked. The salesperson shook his head. ""There's no waiting period?"" William asked. The salesperson shook his head again. ""I don't have to take a safety course?"" William asked. He couldn't believe it was so easy to buy a gun.
""No, sir. It's cash and carry here,"" the salesperson said, ""So can I show you a fine firearm today?"" William shook his head. ""No, but can I take a picture? My friends back in New York won't believe it's this easy to buy a gun here."" ""Sure, buddy,"" the salesperson said, ""I'll even take a picture of you with any weapons you want.""",A2
"One of the best games children play in America is Hide and Seek. You didn't need anything to play, and you could play for hours without getting bored. Another great thing about Hide and Seek is that anyone could play, boys, girls, young, and old. Hide and Seek was great. All you needed was a little imagination and a sense of adventure.
 
The way the game is played is simple. I remember the first time I played. I came up to some of my brother's friends who were playing in the neighborhood. ""Hey, what are you guys playing?"" I asked. ""We are playing Hide and Seek,"" said Robert, my brother's best friend. ""Can I play?"" I asked, even though I didn't really know the rules. After a while, the boys let me play. The object of the game is to hide from one of the players. This person closes his eyes and counts to 10 out loud to start the game. While he or she is counting, the rest of the kids run to find a hiding place.
Hiding places can be anywhere. Behind cars, or in the bushes, just about anywhere! It was Robert's turn. When he had counted 10, he yelled, ""Ready or not, here I come!"" Whoever is the first person found becomes ""It"", and it's their turn to count. I thought I had the best hiding place ever. I was in the bushes near my house. I could see through the leaves everything Robert was doing, and I knew he was getting close to finding David, another one of my friends.
I was overjoyed that I wasn't going to be the first one found. I had proven myself to everybody who said I was too young to play when all of a sudden, a mouse ran over my foot! I jumped and screamed out of the bushes, and was the first one found. The next thing I knew, I was counting out loud and trying to find my friends.",A2
" 
George had always been a funny guy. I met him at the movie theater. I went to see the new Spider-Man movie, and he was there dressed up like Spider-Man. He was acting like Spider-Man, and everyone was clapping for him and asking him for pictures. My girlfriend wanted to go take her picture with him, and I said okay. When I went up to him, I asked him if it was okay to take a picture of him and my girlfriend. He said yes.
 
I took the picture and started talking to him. He told me that his friends hadn't showed up yet, and that he didn't want to sit alone. My girlfriend and I decided to sit with him. After we saw the movie, I asked him if he wanted to go grab a bite to eat. He accepted my invitation. He had me and my girlfriend laughing the whole drive to the restaurant. We talked a lot on the phone. We were big fan of Nintendo games. I invited him over to my house so we could play.
George never had a bad thing to say about anyone. He told me once that there is good in everyone, some are just afraid to show it. George had invited me to his house one day to play old Nintendo games, but when I showed up to his house, no one was there. I looked around and called him on his cell phone, but no one answered. I decided to leave and come back in an hour.
When I got back to George's house, I saw that someone was inside. I knocked on the door, and an older woman came out. It was George's aunt. I asked her if George was home, she looked at me with sad eyes and said that George was in the hospital. I finally understood why George was the way he was. George had cancer, and the doctors told him that he could go at any time. That's why George was always looking for the humor in life, because his real life was filled with sadness.",A2

"Rob Hernandez thought the fuzzy little chick at the pet shop was the cutest thing he had ever seen. He had to buy it. He thought he was buying a baby duck, and named his new pet Chaco. Chaco was loved and grew fast. Rob began to notice, however, that Chaco was growing too fast and getting too big. When Chaco made his first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. Rob expected a quack, but Chaco honked. Chaco was no duck. Chaco was a goose.
 
Rob didn't reject Chaco though. He kept him as long as he could. Chaco was not a quiet goose. He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. Rob's neighbors started to complain. Rob didn't want to give Chaco up, but he couldn't risk his neighbors calling the police on him either. Rob had to make a decision.
Rob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. Rob felt sad leaving Chaco and he was pretty sure his feathered friend felt sad, too. Rob goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner are less sad. When Rob goes to visit, Chaco swims across the lake right into Rob's arms. Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a little peck, a goose's way of giving a kiss.
When Rob goes to visit, he always brings snacks for Chaco. The other geese seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings enough bread for all the geese to share. Rob and Chaco also play. Rob throws his former pet into the lake. Chaco goes underwater, swims a little, and then returns to the shore so that Rob can throw him in again.",A2
"Mary ate a blueberry. She loved blueberries. Then she ate a blackberry. She loved blackberries. Then she ate a strawberry. She loved strawberries. Mary was confused. A blueberry is blue, so you call it a blueberry. A blackberry is black, so you call it a blackberry. A strawberry is red. So, why don't you call it a redberry? Mary asked her mom. Her mom didn't know. She asked her dad. Her dad didn't know. She asked her little brother. ""Because a red berry is a cherry!"" her brother said.",A2
"My first road trip was horrible. When I turned 24 years old, my father lent me his car to go from Los Angeles to Chicago. I told my dad that my friend George was going with me, and he was bringing his girlfriend Nancy. My dad liked that George was going, because he was a responsible young adult, which made me think that my dad doesn't think of me as an adult. When the day we were scheduled to leave arrived, George's girlfriend didn't arrive at my house until 5 p.m. when we agreed we would meet at 2 p.m.
 
It wasn't bad. I had been waiting for this road trip for a year. I could wait a little longer. When Nancy arrived, we packed up her suitcase and hit the road. I was friends with both of them, but George was my friend first. I started getting annoyed with them right away. Even though I had my music playing in the car, I could still hear them in the back kissing and calling each other baby, sweetie, sweetheart, and other nauseating cute names. I didn't like it, but what was I going to do?
George took over the wheel after we left California. He was talking to Nancy the whole time. When we got near the Grand Canyon, Nancy started talking about how she always wanted to go see it. That was when George said those seven words I hated the most, ""What my baby wants, my baby gets."" He started going down a road that led to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. I started to get really annoyed, but decided not to say anything. It was really late, but they didn't care. It turned out the road that led to the Grand Canyon closed after a certain time. Nancy felt embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. After we got back on the highway, I drove all the way to Chicago. George knew that I was bugged, so he tried to keep me company. He even told Nancy to sit in the back, which she did. It was a horrible drive. I couldn't believe I had to drive all the way back to Los Angeles with them.

"Janice was one of those people that loved getting up early for the Black Friday sales stores have after Thanksgiving Day. She loved going to her favorite stores to see what she could get on sale. A friend told her that her favorite store was going to have an amazing sale. They were going to sell an 60-inch television for $300. Janice wanted to make sure she was there early. She went to the store during the night and set up a tent to sleep over night.
 
Janice noticed that no one else had showed up when she was getting her tent ready, but she didn't care. She loved being there. She was so excited about the sales that she couldn't get any sleep. At around 3:30 a.m. she finally fell asleep. She set the alarm on her phone to wake her up at 6 a.m., but because she left her music playing when she fell asleep, her phone ran out of battery.
At around 8 a.m. a man who worked at the store came out and woke Janice up. She was surprised and asked him what time it was. He said it was 8 a.m. and she couldn't believe it. She went into the store and left her tent behind. She wanted to see if they still had the televisions. Janice saw that they didn't. People started looking at her, because her hair was a mess. She felt embarrassed and went back to get her stuff.
While she was going back home, she noticed another store that was open. She decided to go in, and was surprised to see that they had the television she wanted. It was $500, instead of $300. She bought the television and asked one of the workers if they could take it out to her truck. She went home and asked her brother to help her move the television. Once she got the television into her home, she climbed into bed and fell asleep.",A2
"Alex was shopping at the local market yesterday trying to find some fresh vegetables for his dinner that night. The market is in the neighborhood, and it is not one of the giant, national, big-name stores. It is a small store with only a few locations around Los Angeles. Alex likes these types of markets so much better than the super stores because there are real people running them.
 
Alex knows the guy that runs the fruits and vegetables section at the market. His name is Diego, who was born in Tijuana, Mexico, about 120 miles from Los Angeles. Diego always lets Alex know what is a good buy at the market. ""Hola Diego,"" Alex said in Spanish. ""Hey Alex, how are you,"" he answered in English. This happens every time Alex talks to Diego. Alex speaks to him in Spanish, and Diego answers in English.
Spanish is spoken a lot around L.A. The city has the largest population of Mexicans anywhere in the world, except Mexico City. Alex likes to show Diego how much Spanish he knows, and Diego also wanted Alex to know how much English he knows. It's so funny to hear a conversation like this. They sometimes get strange looks from people.
Today, Diego got some beautiful oranges. They were big and plump, and were at the right price, too. ""These are great, Alex. You will like them very much,"" said Diego. Alex responded with ""Muy bueno, Diego,"" which means ""Very good, Diego.""  He also told Alex about some tasty cucumbers they had today, and Alex ended up buying a few of those too. When Alex left, he said, ""Buenas tardes, Diego,"" which is a Mexican farewell phrase, and Diego said, ""See you soon, my friend.""",A2
"Paul Young and Mark Allen were good friends. They both hated summer. Paul hated that it was always hot. Mark hated that the park by his house was always crowded. ""I hate summer,"" Paul told Mark as they played video games in Mark's room. ""I know. Besides not going to school, there is nothing else that's good about summer,"" Mark said.
 
As the two friends played their game, Mark's mom started getting upset with the boys. ""Why don't you boys go outside?"" Mark's mom asked. Mark replied, ""Too many people, and it's too hot."" Mark's mom had enough; she unplugged the game and told Mark that they had to go outside and do something else. They decided to go to the arcade, because at least there they could play games and be inside an air-conditioned building.
When they got there, they realized that two of their friends were at the arcade, too. It was Susan and Carol. Paul liked Susan; Mark didn't really like Carol that much, but he agreed to stay with Carol, so that Paul could hang out with Susan alone. ""Don't do anything stupid, Mark,"" Paul said. ""Oh, shut up and go talk to Susan,"" Mark said. Paul went up to Susan and asked her if she wanted to play a shooting game with him. She said yes. After they played the game, they went back to meet with Carol and Mark.
""You know, Carol and I were about to leave. You guys want to come with us?"" Susan asked the boys. ""Sure, where to?"" Paul asked.

He looked at Mark and whispered, ""Shut up, don't say anything."" They all left, and Mark looked like he was going to cry. ""I hate summer,"" Mark said to himself.

"Donald Walker always looked forward to summer. As he sat down in class, he thought about all the things he was going to do during his summer break. He even made a list. On the top of his list was swimming. Donald loved to go swimming. Even though he was excited to get a break, there was something, or someone he was going to miss. Sarah Lee Parker was his classmate, but he rarely talked to her. Donald liked Sarah a lot. He knew he was going to miss her.
 
The first day of summer had arrived. Donald woke up around noon. He hated waking up early for school, so he wanted to sleep late for the first day of summer. As soon as he woke up, he put on his swimming shorts, got a towel, kissed his mom goodbye, and ran to the park to go to the pool. As Donald jumped into the pool, his heart began to beat fast. The water was clear, but cold.
One of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. As Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to do a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump off again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. Donald got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. Everyone in the deep end of the pool started laughing. Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. ""Ouch, that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me?"" Sarah asked Donald. Donald said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been happier, and never been in that much pain.

"Hannah was worried about the plants in her garden. Her state recently declared a drought and her plants were showing that they missed the rain. Her plants were all dead or dying. Their leaves were brown and dry. Even the small patch of grass in front of her house was drying up because of the lack of rain and the overall shortage of water.
 
Hannah didn't want to give up on her garden. She loved spending time in her yard. She loved working with her hands in the dirt. She loved watering the plants and watching, week by week, her hard work pay off. From a small seed in the soil, she grew flowers and herbs. This season, though, was a bust.
She began to do some research on the Internet on drought-resistant plants, which are plants that would do alright in full sun and without regular water. It turned out there were quite a few plants that were drought-resistant. Through her Internet search, Hannah even found a website for a place that was selling native plants, which were grown naturally from her climate.
Hannah laughed at the name though. It was called a nursery. Hannah always thought a nursery was a bedroom for a new-born baby or a very young child, not a place to buy plants. The more she thought about it though, the more it made sense. Going to a nursery was like going to get a baby. Except in this case, the baby was a plant she would bring home.
Hannah drove 30 minutes to get to the nursery, which had a whole section of drought-resistant plants. She walked up and down the outdoor aisles, carefully considering her options. Then she stopped in front of a small seedling that was just flowering. ""I found my baby,"" she thought.",A2
"It was almost 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. Ed was working. His coworker Jack popped his head inside Ed's cubicle. ""Are you coming to Happy Hour?"" Jack asked. Ed had heard of Happy Meal, but he had never heard about Happy Hour. Ed asked Jack what Happy Hour was. Jack explained that Happy Hour was actually a few hours on weekday afternoons when people were leaving work, and when bars had special prices on drinks and appetizers. Sometimes you pay for only one drink and they give you two; other places have a special menu of food and drinks that is only good during certain hours.
 
Ed thought that really did sound like a good reason to be happy. However, Ed still had at least an hour's worth of work to do. Ed's coworkers encouraged him to come and have at least one drink with them. Ed finally decided to go with them to the nearby pub. However, Ed had more than one drink; he had a few. He had so many drinks that his coworkers put him in a taxi home at the end of the night.
On Saturday morning Ed was not feeling happy at all. He had a horrible headache and felt sick to his stomach. His wife made him a special soup and gave him some medicine.
When Ed returned to work on Monday morning, he felt much better physically. His coworkers, however, teased him about drinking so much on Friday. His boss wondered why Ed hadn't completed all the work he was supposed to finish on Friday. Ed certainly couldn't tell his boss that he left work early to go and drink with his colleagues. Ed was called into his boss's office to explain. ""I guess I was too happy,"" Ed said unhappily.",A2
"One of the greatest American traditions is the game of baseball. Living in Los Angeles has given me the chance to watch one of the oldest baseball teams in the history of the game -- the Dodgers. The team came into existence in New York City in the 1880s, when they were known by several names. Until 1956, the Dodgers played in Brooklyn New York, but in 1957, the team moved west to Los Angeles, and it has played there ever since.
 
I recently asked my wife Josie if she wanted to go to a game one night, and of course she said yes. ""Why wouldn't I want to go? The weather is great and the stadium is beautiful. Besides, I think we need a break in our routine,"" she said. ""You're absolutely right, baby. Let's go!"" I said.
We were off to Dodger Stadium, which is nestled in the hills just north of downtown L.A. in a neighborhood called Chavez Ravine. Even though it is the third oldest stadium in the country, it is still beautiful. ""Wow. This place never gets old,"" I said as we got to our seats. Josie agreed. It was a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the low 70s, and it was a clear, breezy night.
The Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though. The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. ""I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they are delicious,"" I told Josie. She wiped some mustard off her face and said, ""Absolutely!""

"Every June, my old elementary school has a carnival on its ground. This has been happening since I was a little boy. I used to have so much fun there. It was amazing. It had rides like the Ferris wheel and the flying teacups. The Ferris wheel was this huge wheel that carried two people in a giant circle above the rest of the carnival. I remember the first time I got on it when I was 7 years old. I had been begging my mom for months to let me ride it.
 
""Please, mom, please. I'm big enough now,"" I would scream. However, she kept saying, ""You're too young, Billy. Maybe one day."" Of course, 7-year-old kids have short memories. I kept asking over and over again until she finally said okay, but she said she was going with me. ""I'm a big boy, mom. I can go alone,"" I said. She would not agree. ""We're going together, or not at all,"" she said. And of course I said okay.
When the big day came, I was so excited. I almost had an accident while waiting in line. The guy who was seating people kept saying ""Next"" as more and more people got on and the line kept shrinking. His shouts of ""Next"" kept getting louder and louder and I knew my time was coming up. When we finally reached the end of the line, it felt like I waited a month, we got on and put on our seat belts. I was excited and afraid at the same time. Then it started.
I went so high up in the air that I got dizzy. My stomach began to turn, and I felt like throwing up. It was just too fast and too high for me. I didn't get sick, but I was sure glad I was on the ground again when I told my mom, ""Please don't send me up there again, mom!""",A2
"""I'm calling the police,"" Barry said. ""I'm glad you're calling the police,"" Ruth said. Barry and Ruth had a nice house. They had a nice, quiet house. They had nice neighbors. They had nice, quiet neighbors. But tonight, their neighbors were not quiet. They were having a pool party. Everyone was drinking. Everyone was talking loud. Everyone was jumping into the pool. Loud music was playing. Car horns were honking. Barry and Ruth closed all their windows. But they still heard the party. Barry called the police. The policeman said, ""We'll be there in an hour or two."" Barry asked, ""Why not sooner?"" ""The mayor's having a big party,"" the policeman said. ""Most of our officers are protecting the mayor and his guests.""",A2
"""Do you believe in ghost?"" Alvin asked his brother Levi one night, as they were lying down in bed around eleven at night. ""I don't think so,"" Levi replied. Alvin and Levi shared a room together. ""Why not?"" asked Alvin. ""I have never seen one,"" Levi said. Alvin was twelve years old and Levi was eighteen. ""I think I saw one, Levi,"" Alvin told his brother, sounding frightened. ""Go to sleep, Alvin,"" Levi told his brother, as he turned around in his bed to face the closet. ""There's no such thing as ghost,"" Levi said.
 
Alvin and Levi were lying on separate beds. Levi had fallen asleep half an hour ago, but Alvin was still awake. He was having a hard time trying to go to sleep. A sound was keeping him awake. It sounded like someone was walking out in the hallway, right outside his bedroom door. It was completely dark.
Alvin was curious to find out who was sauntering out in the hallway. Fifteen minutes had passed and the creaking hadn't stopped. Alvin slowly rose from his bed. He moved towards his door, taking one step every two seconds. When he finally reached his door, he put his hand on the doorknob and gradually began to turn it. The walking had not ceased.
""Alvin, what are you doing?"" Levi said right before Alvin could open the door. ""I think there's a ghost in the hallway,"" Alvin replied. Levi rose to his feet and went to the door. ""I'll go with you."" Levi said. The two opened the door together and popped their heads out the door to take a look. ""You see, it was nothing,"" Levi said. Alvin and Levi went back to bed. Levi again fell asleep before Alvin. Alvin could not go to sleep. There was someone walking in the hallway.",A2
"Mary was a girl with long brown hair and pretty eyes. Every evening she would take her dog out for a walk. Mary's dog was a Beagle. She had named him Buddy because he was so friendly to everybody he met. Buddy never barked or bit anyone when Mary took him out on his walks. Buddy did not even flinch at the sight of cats and other dogs. He truly was a buddy to all.
 
One night, as Mary was walking Buddy, something unexpected occurred. For the first time in his life, Buddy became aggravated. ""What's the matter, Buddy?"" Mary asked. Buddy replied only in barks, as if he was trying to communicate back. All of a sudden, the wind grew still and the air became cold. Mary decided to turn around and head back home. But before she could, a raspy voice called out her name. Mary right away turned around and yelled, ""Who's there?"" Buddy had stopped barking.
A boy stepped forward from the shadows and slowly revealed his identity. ""Tom, is that you?"" Mary asked the timid boy, who was now in plain sight. Tom was looking down at the floor with his hand in his pockets. ""What are you doing, Tom? Have you been following me?"" Mary asked, slightly confused. Tom stood there embarrassed and slowly started talking. ""I'm sorry I snuck up on you. I didn't mean to frighten you,"" Tom first said. Mary could tell that Tom was nervous. She also knew of the feelings Tom had for her.
""It's not safe for someone like you to be walking at night all alone,"" Tom said. ""I'm not alone. I have Buddy,"" Mary replied. ""You should have somebody accompanying you and Buddy on nights like these,"" said Tom. ""Would you like to tag along, Tom?"" Mary asked. Tom was too struck to answer. He had been waiting for this moment to happen.

"One of the first things Gustav wanted to do when he got to the United States was to see as much of it as he could. He would be flying into New York City's John F. Kennedy airport. In New York he planned to see the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. Then he wanted to go to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell. Then he wanted to go to the nation's capital, Washington D.C., where he hoped to see the White House, and maybe he would even see President. He knew that getting to the three east coast cities was pretty easy. He could take a train or bus.
 
Gustav wasn't sure though about how he would get to the other parts of the United States he wanted to see. For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.
Once in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C. ""What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?"" Gustav asked. ""What about them?"" the concierge asked, looking confused. ""What about trips there?"" Gustav asked. The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. ""A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about six hours,"" the concierge explained. Gustav was disappointed. He had no idea that the United States was such a large country. He was determined to see as much as he could though. He wondered how much it would cost to rent a camper and drive it across the U.S.",A2
"Let me tell you about my family. They are embarrassing to say the least. The first time I brought a boy home to meet my parents, they asked him countless questions that no parent should ask. ""When did you lose your virginity? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? How many sexual partners have you had?"" Safe to say, that boy I brought home stopped talking to me after he met my parents. I stayed single throughout my time at high school. It was not that I didn't like anyone or that no one liked me. It was that my parents had a rule. They had to approve of whoever I would be dating. Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.
 
I hate that I can't have normal parents. They are weird. They like collecting old books, and watching old movies. They listen to old records on an old record player. They say that it's better than listening to an iPod. I always let them know that at least I can listen to my iPod when I go out. The last day of high school had passed, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I decided to take a year off and work. My parents didn't like it, but it was my decision to make.
I got a job at a little restaurant called ""Baker's Cabin"". It was a nice restaurant where people could sit down and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. I liked working there. However, what I liked most was the bartender Paul. He had barely turned 21, and was already working behind the bar. We started talking. I think he really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward when he meets my parents. One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way he could date me was to meet my parents. Paul went over that night with some records his dad had given him, and offered them to my parents. They went nuts, and invited him in. They started asking him questions, but not about his sex life or religious beliefs. The questions were all about music. They really liked him, and they were actually acting normal. I think Paul is the guy for me.",A2
"I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn't even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. I was always interested in art, so that was a special treat for me. The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there. Henry got tired walking around the museum and said ""Enough! I need to take a break and rest.""
We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes along the river Seine. The French food we ate was delicious. The wines were tasty, too. Steve's favorite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. He said he would be happy if he could eat croissants like those forever. We had so much fun that we're already talking about our next vacation!",A2
"Hi, Fred!
It's been a while since we have been in touch. How has your semester been?
I wanted to send you an email update to you let you know how things have been going during my semester abroad here in Malaga, Spain. I've already been here for six weeks, and I feel like I am finally adapting to the culture. I'm also speaking the language more fluently.
I arrived during the first week of September. The weather has been very nice. Even though it's October, it's still rather sunny and warm. In fact, I went to the beach and swam in the Mediterranean Sea earlier today.
I am living with a very welcoming host family. I have my own private bedroom, but we eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner together. On Sundays, we eat a big home-cooked paella for lunch. In Spain, lunch is usually the biggest meal of the day. It's also very common for the people to take a midday nap right after a big meal. I am actually just waking up from my nap right now!
On weekdays, I take classes at the local university. There, I met several native Spanish speakers. They have been very kind and patient with me. At first, I struggled to comprehend their Spanish, but now I understand most of our conversations. They have commented that my Spanish has improved a lot since we first met. Now, I am more confident to use the language in other places like stores and restaurants.
I am so glad that I decided to spend the semester here in Spain. We have an extended weekend coming up, so a group of my friends and I are going to travel to France for four days. It's so easy and inexpensive to travel internationally in Europe. I love it!
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Like I said, don't hesitate to stay in touch more often. Perhaps you could even come to visit! What do you think?
Best wishes,
Patrick",A2

"A loud boom woke her up. She looked at the clock next to her bed. It was midnight. ""What was that?"" she asked her husband, who hadn't been woken up by the sound, so Betty shook him. Another loud boom followed. Then there was a crackling sound. ""Oh, that's just fireworks,"" Betty's husband said. It wasn't the fourth of July, the most common day to hear fireworks. It was just a normal Thursday night in the middle of June. ""Why would there be fireworks now?"" Betty asked.
 
Betty and her husband just moved into a new house after their wedding. This was the neighborhood her husband grew up in. He said it was common for people to start setting off fireworks in the summer, even before the Independence Day holiday. ""The whole summer is a reason for fireworks here,"" Betty's husband told her. He said that even when it wasn't summer, people set off fireworks for whatever they were celebrating.
""Maybe someone is having a graduation party or a birthday,"" Betty's husband told her. He said that sometimes people set off fireworks even when a local sports team won a game. Betty wondered how that was legal. She thought fireworks were illegal to buy and use. Betty's husband told her that it was easy enough for people to buy fireworks. He also told her that different counties in the state had different laws, so people could buy fireworks in one county and use them in a different county, like where they lived. ""Also people can legally set off fireworks for holidays besides the fourth of July, like for Lunar New Year,"" he added.
Betty tried to go back to sleep, but the loud booms and crackles kept going. She decided to get a glass of water and go out into the yard to see the fireworks.",A2

"Tina was very involved in her daughter's education. She made sure her daughter did her homework. She also volunteered at her school. She especially liked to help parents who did not speak English. Tina often would translate at parent-teacher conferences and meetings. She also translated some of the papers that the school sent home. Tina was a member of the parent-teacher association. She went to every meeting and open forum. Tina was so active in her daughter's school that she was elected to be vice-president of the parent-teacher association.
 
The principal of the school did not like Tina though. She felt Tina was too involved. She didn't like how Tina insisted that there be translation at every meeting, and that every paper that went home be in different languages. The principal felt Tina was creating more work for her and her staff. She thought Tina was a troublemaker.
The way Tina looked didn't help her. She had many tattoos, and often dyed her hair in non-traditional colors like pink and green. One evening, after Tina's daughter received an award for her good grades, Tina went up to greet the principal. The principal responded coldly: ""Congratulations."" The principal then offered some advice to Tina's daughter. ""When you grow up, don't become like your mother,"" the principal told the young girl. The little girl was confused. Tina was furious. How dare the principal speak to her that way? Tina may not have looked like all the other parents, but what she looked like shouldn't matter. Tina's daughter hugged her mother. ""I don't care that you have green hair, mommy,"" she said, ""I care that you care about me and my school.""",A2

"Arsenal striker Eduardo has been ruled out for two weeks with a hamstring injury just days after returning from a broken leg.
Eduardo sinks to his knees after opening the scoring on his Arsenal first team comeback on Monday.
The Croatian international only made his comeback after a year out in Monday's FA Cup fourth-round victory against Cardiff.
The 25-year-old marked his return with two goals in the 4-0 success at the Emirates Stadium, but his latest setback is not described as serious.
Manager Arsene Wenger told Arsenal TV Online: Eduardo is out for two weeks. He picked up a hamstring injury two minutes before I took him off. What a nightmare.
 Nobody knows how it happened but I knew straight away after the game it would be a two-week job. It is nothing like he had before but I do know that little setbacks like this are part of being nine months out.
 After that long out nobody plays six months on the trot. It is impossible. But at the same time it is a blow because, of course, he can score goals. He had shown that on Monday night.

"Edward Allen always hated living in Los Angeles. Everything was too expensive; traffic was always bad; people were not friendly; it was always crowded. Edward never wanted to live in a big city. He always wanted to live somewhere in the country, in a small town, where everyone knew everyone. It was a dream that he was dedicated to achieving.
 
The day after his 26th birthday, he called his friend Lisa, who had moved to a small town in Iowa. He asked her how it was like over there. She told him that he would love it. It's quiet and peaceful; people are friendly. Edward made up his mind; he was going to move to this little town. He sat down with his mom and dad, and told them what he was planning on doing. They supported his decision and helped him pack his things. He would leave in a week.
Lisa had helped Edward get a job where she worked, and she told Edward he could stay with her and her roommate until he got back on his feet. Edward was grateful. When he showed up, he immediately started working. He liked his job, but he found it a bit boring at times. He was a waiter at a cafe. He liked the pie at the restaurant, so it wasn't all bad.
After he had been working for two months, he told Lisa that he couldn't handle it anymore. He wanted to go back to the city. Lisa laughed and said, ""You have always hated the city, but now you're running back to it? I don't get you, Edward."" Edward didn't think living in a small town would be so boring.

"My mom was pregnant with her second child. I was happy because I was going to be a big brother. My dad and mom told me that it was going to be a boy.

Her friends all gave her their extra boy clothes that their sons had used, and my mom loved it.

When my mom went into the hospital, my dad was excited and jumping up and down, but after my mom had the baby, my dad came out with a confused look on his face. I asked him what was wrong, if the baby was okay. He looked at me and said yes, but that the baby was actually a girl. My grandma looked at him, and smacked him in the head. She said, ""That's wonderful news. Don't look so depressed!""
My dad laughed and said ""No, I'm not depressed, I'm just confused."" For the first three months of her life, my sister looked like a boy. She wore nothing but boy's clothes, because that's all my parents had gotten for her. I took a lot of pictures, so I could tell her later that she was actually a boy, but an accident happened that changed her into a girl. My mom deleted all my photos because it was mean.

"Meryl was a little embarrassed to admit it. She was 37 years old, and didn't know how to drive. When she lived in Queens, it wasn't such a big deal. Everything that she needed was close by. The supermarket was one block away. She would take her shopping cart and get what she needed for the week easily. When she didn't feel like dragging the shopping cart, the supermarket even delivered for free. All she had to do was tip the driver. She would use that same shopping cart to take clothes to and from the laundromat, which was only a block away. While Meryl's job was not a block away, the subway station was. Every day she would walk the block to catch a 45-minute underground train ride to work. She repeated the journey in reverse to return home in the evenings.
 
Alhambra sure was different, though. The walk from Meryl's house to the supermarket was nearly a mile. She didn't feel like walking that long a distance while pushing shopping cart full of a week's worth of food. The laundromat was a mile in the other direction. She wasn't going to push her dirty clothes through that many streets. There were no trains nearby to take her to work, just buses. The buses always took a long time to come. For the first few weeks, Meryl was always late everywhere. Sometimes when she had an urgent appointment, Meryl would ask friends to give her a ride somewhere. Almost all of her friends had cars and knew how to drive. Most of them learned it when they were in high school.
After a while, her friends were tired of giving Meryl rides everywhere. ""You need to learn how to drive, Meryl,"" they told her. She knew they were right, but Meryl was scared.",A2

It was a Chihuahua named Taco. He wondered if Pet Wonders was selling any Chihuahuas.
 
Jenny and her dad were greeted by a short and balding man, who smelled like dog food. ""Hello, how can I help you guys today?"" the man said. ""We're here to buy a pony!"" Jenny exclaimed to the man. ""Actually, we're here to browse,"" Jenny's dad said right after. ""Let me know when you're ready to make a purchase,"" the man replied. Jenny and her dad proceeded to look through the aisles.
""What do you think of these, Jenny?"" asked her dad. ""They're too small,"" she said. Jenny saw a variety of colorful fishes. ""What about these, Jenny?"" her dad asked. ""They're too slimy,"" said Jenny. Jenny came across snakes and turtles. ""Would you like one of these?"" asked her dad. ""I don't think so,"" Jenny responded.

Audrey is a fine seamstress, and every year she makes the best costumes for the Halloween parties we try to attend. On the other hand, I usually just put some old rags on and go as a hobo or a pirate, or something lame like that, but not Audrey. She goes all out. Last year, she went as a beautiful witch complete with the pointy hat and witch's broom. She looked beautiful.
 
The Halloween tradition is very old in the United States. No one really knows how it was first celebrated, but it did come from somewhere in Europe. It was originally called ""All Hallows Eve"", and celebrated on last day of October. It precedes ""All Hallows Day"", which is a day to honor dead relatives. Today, it means parties for the adults and ""Trick or treating"" for the kids. ""Trick or treating"" is where kids also dress up in costumes and go door to door to get candy treats. It's a whole lot of fun.
Some people say Halloween is a Welsh, or Celtic tradition, while others say its roots are Christian, but it doesn't really matter anymore. We just like to get dressed up like fools, go to parties, and eat lots of candy! Audrey finally showed up at my door. She was strikingly beautiful. She was dressed as a fairy princess and was glowing in her white gown. ""You look amazing,"" I told her. She just laughed and said, ""I know,"" and tapped me with her wand.",A2
"Checklist for opening the shop
Start at 8 a.m.
Firstly, when you enter the shop, remember to turn off the alarm.  
Do this by holding your key card to the alarm panel. It's behind the door near the light switches.
Open all the blinds and turn on the lights.
Please don't forget to start the coffee machine so your colleagues have fresh coffee for when they arrive.
At 8.15 a.m., watch out for the fresh deliveries at the back door. They usually arrive at that time.
Pay attention to the order list and what is actually delivered.
Remember not to sign for anything that isn't in the delivery as there are often items missing.
Check the answer phone and shop email account for any new messages.
Leave the heating and the air conditioning alone. They are on an automatic timer. So please, don't go near the control panels.
Finally, you need to finish everything above before 8.45 a.m. and open the shop at 9 a.m. There is a red logbook under the counter. Make sure you sign it for each day when you have completed all points on this checklist. Make a note of any issues.
If you have any problems, call your supervisor or the 24-hour support line number below.",A2
"My profile
About me
By day I'm a regular guy and by night a superhero ... How tiring is that?!
Just joking! I'm a regular guy all the time, good job, close to my family, just bought my own flat with a cat. Actually, my cat thinks I'm a hero because I saved her from the street. I'm a talkative person and I believe communication is the most important thing in a relationship.
Likes and dislikes
I love pizza if it's Italian, wine if it's white, and football if it's the World Cup. I read a lot, especially true life stories, but most of my books live on my phone.
Hobbies
I love to travel and I'm always planning my next trip. I prefer an active holiday like hiking, skiing or watersports and I get bored lying on the beach. I post lots of photos on Instagram as I'm a good photographer but I'd really love to share the holiday with someone. Maybe you'll take the photos on the next trip. wink

"Dennis had always been a terrible student. When he was a kid, his parents sent him to a Catholic school. He didn't know much about the school. Of course he didn't know much about anything when he was 6 years old, but he did know one thing -- all his friends from the neighborhood went to a public school. Dennis was the only boy that went to a private school, and his friends would often tease him about it. ""You're not one of us! You're not one of us,"" they would sometimes chant. He wasn't really alone, though. His friend Patricia also went to the Catholic school, but she was a girl. After a while, they began walking to the small school together every morning. Pat was the first girl friend Dennis had ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a friend who happened to be a girl.
 
The nuns at the school were very mean. They ruled the school like it was a prison. Dennis was afraid to even raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called into meetings with the principal about Dennis, who would also sit in the office listening to the principal telling his mother how smart he was, but was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well in school and ended up going to a junior college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and soon dropped out.
That all changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years before deciding he wanted to earn a degree after all. Dennis went back to school at the age of 30, and soon was a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns thought he was.",A2

Can you believe it? Someone in another group asked me to write some pages of their website in English and French. But they can't pay because 'I'm starting this business with no money.' He said he's a professional photographer and he can do some photos for me instead. Am I wrong to be angry?
Asher87
Nope! I'd be angry too

"The country is full of criminals. Criminals are in every city. Criminals are on every block. They break all the laws. They don't care about the laws. There are thousands of laws. The criminals break all the laws. They laugh when they break the laws. The police watch the criminals. They try to arrest the criminals. The criminals shoot at the police. They kill the police. Last week they shot down a police helicopter. The helicopter crashed to the ground. The criminals ran over to the helicopter. All the policemen on the helicopter were dead. The criminals stole the guns from the dead policemen. They walked away from the helicopter. They were laughing.

"""When are you going to get a haircut?"" Johnny's relatives would ask whenever they saw him. Johnny's reply was always the same, ""When pigs start to fly."" Although Johnny was aware that his relatives thought he was funny, he was also aware of their concern regarding his long shoulder-length hair. Johnny's hair was black and wavy. He began growing it after high school. Two years had passed since then, and Johnny had no intention of cutting it anytime soon.
 
Johnny loved his long hair, and took good care of it. Every day he would wash it and brush it fifty times. Johnny felt so cool with his long hair. It made him look like a rock star. While in high school, Johnny always had short hair. Although it did not look unappealing, he was not too fond of his short hair, and desired to grow it out one day. He made a promise to himself to do so after graduation. Johnny had gone through with his promise.
Johnny's hair received plenty of attention. As he walked down the street, he often heard ""Nice hair kid,"" from strangers. ""Thank you very much,"" Johnny would reply, feeling flattered. Once, Johnny passed by a group of girls who giggled and looked at him. ""I like your hair,"" one of them said to Johnny as he walked away. Being the cool cat that he now was, Johnny loved every minute of having long hair.
Johnny wondered why he didn't decide to let his hair grow sooner. It was the best decision he had ever made, and nothing in the world could make him cut it.",A2
