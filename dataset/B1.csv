"David and Melissa had been a happily married couple for six years. They lived a comfortably modest life in a small apartment and had been saving up for years in preparation for the next giant step in their life: a baby. However, after repeatedly trying to get pregnant for a whole year, they consulted a doctor and received devastating news. Melissa would be unable to conceive a child for the rest of her life.
The bad news struck Melissa terribly hard. Seeing his wife in such a distraught and depressed state broke David's heart. ""Don't worry,"" he told her. ""I'm going to make you the happiest woman in the planet, even if it's just the two of us."" He then went to the bank, took out all their savings that had been held for the baby, and set out to do whatever he could to cheer his wife up.
Since they no longer had to be careful with how much money they spent, David began splurging on everything he could think of. First, he took Melissa shopping for the finest and most beautiful clothes she could dream of. Then, they took an exotic vacation to the Florida Keys, where they spent a month exploring every island and spending thousands of dollars on the most beautiful hotels, and most delicious foods they could find.
When they finally returned home. Melissa said,""Oh, David! Everything is perfect! I'm actually glad we don't have a child."" David smiled, content with his wife's happiness, and walked over to check their voicemails from when they were away. The machine bleeped and then their doctor's voice came on saying, ""Hi guys. Great news! There was a mistake in the test results. You are actually six weeks pregnant! It's Triplets.""",B1
"The American Civil War happened from 1861 to 1865. The main cause was Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops like cotton were sold to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to keep the country united.
 
Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the entire United States.
The Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died, more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered.",B1
"The next time you decide to check your Facebook page to see if you have any new messages, likes, or just to see what your friends are up to, you can thank Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is the man who changed the way people keep in touch with each other. He literally changed the world.
 
Born in White Plains, New York on May 14, 1984, Zuckerberg developed an interest in computer programming at an early age. When he was just 12 years old, he had developed a working messaging system that his father Edward used in his dental office. Zuckerberg had many friends who were artists, and they would come by and draw pictures for Mark. He would then design a computer game based on the characters drawn. In high school, Zuckerberg developed a music software program that drew interest from several large companies. He enrolled into Harvard University in 2002, where he developed his first social networking site for students only. The site was very popular, but it was shut down by the school for being inappropriate.
During his sophomore year at Harvard, Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, a site that allowed its users to create a profile, share photos, and communicate with other members. He dropped out his sophomore year to dedicate his work to his site. He moved his operation to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had had more than 1,000,000 members.
Zuckerberg's rise to the top has not been without controversy. Some of his Harvard peers claimed he stole their ideas, and filed suit against Zuckerberg. The case was settled, but it continues to be an issue. Facebook generates more than $1.5 billion in net revenues today.",B1

Subject: Hi!
Hi Sunny!
How are you?
We're finally coming to Singapore so I wanted to ask your advice on what we should do while we're there. What shouldn't we miss? We'll have our two kids aged 6 and 8 with us so ideally we want to do things we can enjoy as a family.
We've already got a hotel booked in Marina Bay and we arrive on 12 May for a week.
I hope you're around so we can meet up!
See you soon,

Subject: Re: Hi!
Hi Janet!
Lovely to hear from you and how exciting that you're coming!
You've picked a great area to stay in as it's right next to a must-see attraction, Gardens by the Bay. They light them up at night and the kids will love it. Another place to take the little ones is the zoo, and the Night Safari is really worth doing. The animals are much more active at night than during the day, so it's pretty special.
As for food, there's quite a variety here. I'd recommend trying laksa and kaya toast - they're both really typical Singaporean foods. You can also eat well and cheaply at street markets. You should definitely check them out.
Can't wait to see you all!

"A wake is when people go to a deceased person's home or a funeral parlor to pay their last respects. A funeral parlor is a place where the preparation of the corpse for burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be dressing the deceased, doing their makeup, and placing them in a coffin for people to see. Some people do have a closed casket wake, where you can't see the dead person; some people are not even choosing coffins for their dearly departed loved ones.
 
In the United States, more and more families are choosing not to have traditional wakes. There is a recent trend of people having non-traditional wakes with the deceased person posed doing something they loved doing when they were alive. For example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one posed at a table with a cigarette between her fingers and a can of beer. One funeral home in Puerto Rico has become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family asked for their dead loved one to be propped up against the wall of their home for the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his dead body in the driver's seat of an ambulance. Another family had a man propped up in a fake boxing ring for his wake. One dead man was posed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother was posed sitting in her rocking chair.
These non-traditional wakes have their critics though. Some people think they are disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not a time to pose the dead as if they were toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they were when they were alive.",B1
"Here's one way to make your iPhone hacker-proof: Ask hackers for advice.
I recently caught up with security researchers at the online security conference Infiltrate. At dinner one evening, I placed my iPhone on the table. I was surrounded by ethical hackers whose jobs are to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys and exploit security flaws.
 I could hack your phone pretty easily, security researcher Tomi Tuominen mentioned. Obviously, I took notice.
For the next 20 minutes, Tuominen and information security researcher Robert Lee gave me a tutorial on making my iPhone settings hacker-proof. Some of them are basic -- like changing your four character password to something more complex. Others take a bit more work, such as using settings to limit ad tracking.

"T.J. Lane, a remorseless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured.
For six long hours, police scoured neighborhoods on the north end of Lima, Ohio, asking residents to lock their doors and stay inside.
They brought in extra officers and provided patrols to the families of Lane's victims.
In the end, he was found 100 yards away outside a church, the prison warden said. He did n't say anything, nor did he put up a fight, authorities said.
Lane was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for his attack at Chardon High School on February 27, 2012.
He walked in to the school cafeteria with a.22 - caliber gun and randomly started shooting. He fired 10 rounds, killing three students.
The 19-year-old scaled a fence at the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, about 90 miles northwest of Columbus, Warden Kevin Jones said.
 He was n't in the maximum-security facility. That is something we have to sit down and take a look at. 
Lane escaped, along with two other men, about 7:40 p.m. Thursday.
He was back in custody about shortly after 1 a.m. Friday.
 You never plan on someone escaping and certainly someone of that notoriety, you would think that they would take special precautions to prevent this, Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday.
 This was a huge case here in Ohio. So, everyone in Ohio is shocked right now. 
Friends, family remember Ohio school shooting victims
Prison infractions
The Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution houses about 1,600 inmates guarded by 257 security personnel.
A Correctional Institution Inspection Committee report in April said the facility was over capacity by 217 inmates. In addition, the number of inmate assaults on staff increased by 60.7 % last year, compared with 2012. No escapes were mentioned in the report.
In the 18 months he's been there, Lane was disciplined seven times, according to The Plain Dealer newspaper.
The infractions ranged from urinating on a wall to giving himself a tattoo, the paper said.
Lane escaped with Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving time for aggravated robbery, and another man. All three have been captured.
Chardon is about 190 miles away from Lima.
 We 're upset this happened, said Ron Parmetor, whose nephew Daniel Parmetor, 16, was one of Lane's victims.
Parmetor says he wants answers; how could Lane just escape ?
The other two victims were Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King Jr., 17.
Chardon schools will be closed Friday, but counselors and other support services will be provided, the school district superintendent said.
Community shaken
Chardon is a community of 5,100 people, some 30 miles east of Cleveland.
It was shaken by the shooting at the high school, and further traumatized by Lane's behavior in court.
Lane pleaded guilty last year to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges. But he never offered an explanation.
He was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life without parole and additional sentences totaling 37 years.
At the sentencing hearing, Lane unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal a white T-shirt on which he had scrawled the word KILLER across the front. He had on a similar shirt during his shooting rampage.
Before the sentencing, he addressed the victimsfamilies using profane imagery and ending with the expletive, F -- all of you. 
He then held up his middle finger.
 For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback, said Friedman, who has n't talked to Lane in about a year. There was no way to fully comprehend what happened in the courtroom that afternoon. 
T.J. Lane tightlipped about motive, escape

"(1) Fairies today are the stuff of children's stories, little magical people with wings, often shining with light. Typically pretty and female, like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, they usually use their magic to do small things and are mostly friendly to humans.
(2) We owe many of our modern ideas about fairies to Shakespeare and stories from the 18th and 19th centuries. Although we can see the origins of fairies as far back as the Ancient Greeks, we can see similar creatures in many cultures. The earliest fairy-like creatures can be found in the Greek idea that trees and rivers had spirits called dryads and nymphs. Some people think these creatures were originally the gods of earlier, pagan religions that worshipped nature. They were replaced by the Greek and Roman gods, and then later by the Christian God, and became smaller, less powerful figures as they lost importance.
(3) Another explanation suggests the origin of fairies is a memory of real people, not spirits. So, for example, when tribes with metal weapons invaded land where people only used stone weapons, some of the people escaped and hid in forests and caves. Further support for this idea is that fairies were thought to be afraid of iron and could not touch it. Living outside of society, the hiding people probably stole food and attacked villages. This might explain why fairies were often described as playing tricks on humans. Hundreds of years ago, people actually believed that fairies stole new babies and replaced them with a 'changeling' - a fairy baby - or that they took new mothers and made them feed fairy babies with their milk.
(4) While most people no longer believe in fairies, only a hundred years ago some people were very willing to think they might exist. In 1917, 16-year-old Elsie Wright took two photos of her cousin, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths, sitting with fairies. Some photography experts thought they were fake, while others weren't sure. But Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories, believed they were real. He published the original pictures, and three more the girls took for him, in a magazine called The Strand, in 1920. The girls only admitted the photos were fake years later in 1983, created using pictures of dancers that Elsie copied from a book.",B1
"Once a child finishes 5th or 6th grade in elementary school, they graduate and go on to middle school or junior high school. This school is a separate building or set of buildings. Most students in middle school are between the ages of 10 and 14. The grade system continues in middle school. Middle school usually starts with 6th or 7th grade and ends with 8th grade. While they are less common, some elementary schools go from kindergarten to 8th grade.
 
Most students are assigned a middle school based on where they live. However, there are charter, private, and specialized public middle schools that have an application process. The purpose of middle school is to provide a transition period between elementary school and high school. Middle school prepares students for high school life. In middle school students don't stay in one classroom all day with one teacher. Students change classrooms for different subjects and have different teachers for each subject. In middle school some students may even be able to choose some of their own classes, called electives. There is a set of core classes that all students have to take. These include English, math, science, and social studies or history classes. Gym or physical education classes are also required.
A common feature of middle school is a homeroom, which is a classroom students visit at a scheduled time once a day or once a week. A homeroom teacher takes attendance and makes announcements of things students need to know. The homeroom also helps students feel like there is one common place and one common teacher they see regularly. This is to help with the transition from elementary school to secondary school. Once a student finishes middle school, they have a graduation ceremony and go to a high school assigned to them or a high school they picked.",B1
"Debbie Benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44. His death left her to raise a young child alone. For 16 years, she stayed single because, going through it once was enough for me. 
When she met Dale Benzine, he weighed around 300 pounds but was in pretty good physical shape. Yet over time, she watched as the former football player started taking pills for his high cholesterol and high blood pressure, more for anxiety and gout, and insulin shots for his Type 2 diabetes.
 His girth got bigger, as did his neck, which caused sleep apnea, she remembers. After the Atlanta couple got married, she found herself buying him bigger and bigger clothes.
When her insurance company announced that bariatric surgery, or weight-loss surgery, would be covered under the couple's plan, she told her husband about it. I knew he had to do something, but I was n't sure he was ready for something so drastic, she says.
He was.
The doctor had flat-out told Benzine: Lose weight or die. He was tired of taking so many medications and not having enough energy to simply live life.
 One day... you find out that you 're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it, he says.
There are several types of bariatric surgery. With gastric bypass, a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines.
Another type involves placing an adjustable band around the upper portion of the stomach. The device can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor's visits. It can help patients feel fuller faster and eat less. Unlike gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed.
Benzine decided to do the gastric bypass surgery. Although doctors are n't sure why, studies have shown gastric bypass puts Type 2 diabetes into remission in most obese patients. Dale also did n't want to have the option of reversing the surgery.
 In the back of your mind you can always take the band off, he says of the lap-band procedure. I did n't want to be able to go back. 
Getting approved for the surgery was more difficult than he expected. Many people who have bariatric surgery gain the weight back, so insurance companies are often wary of paying for the procedure. Benzine saw his primary care physician, a nutritionist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a gastroenterologist and a psychiatrist -- all of whom had to sign off.
The psychiatrist told Benzine he rejected upward of half his patients because they were n't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery. Benzine admitted that 10 years ago he would n't have been ready either.
 I 'm from Wisconsin, he says. I enjoyed my beer, brats and cheese too much. But kids and grandkids changes things. He was ready.
He eventually got the go-ahead. The day of his surgery, his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck. I tried to dissuade -LRB- him -RRB- from having it. What if they made a wrong cut ? What if he did n't wake up ? What if he had a heart attack on the table ? 
The surgery was a success, but he was far from the ideal patient. Shortly after surgery he ate a popsicle too fast and starting throwing up. When he got home, he continued his trial-and-error period, getting sick as he learned his limits.
 Imagine after you eat your big Thanksgiving dinner -- times 10, he says of overeating with his smaller stomach. And you ca n't do anything about it. You 're just so miserable and it's either got to come up or go out. 
He started out on a liquid diet, then pureed his food. Slowly he introduced solids.
 We did n't go to happy hour or dinner with friends because he was uncomfortable, Debbie Benzine says. I started hiding out to eat because I felt guilty. 
It was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again, Benzine says. He realized that meat -- steak, chicken, turkey -- was too tough for his stomach to handle. But popcorn went down easily. He developed 10 rules for himself, and other bariatric patients, and the weight began to fall off.
In six months, he had lost more than 125 pounds.
The hardest thing for him was filling time. He had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food. He now smokes a cigar instead of eating a bag of chips, or plans a big weekend getaway to celebrate a work success. He orders an appetizer instead of an entree when he goes out to play cards with friends during the week.
His daily diet routinely consists of Greek yogurt, protein bars, soup, popcorn, cheese and crackers. He does n't eat large meals, just smaller portions whenever he's hungry.
In some ways, his wife has had to alter her lifestyle to fit his. It has n't been easy, the couple says, but it has been worth it.
 I 'm 57 going on 37, Benzine says with a laugh. No pun intended -- I 'm like a kid in a candy store. He plans to attend his 40th high school reunion in June with pride: I know I 'll be one of the only people who can say they weigh less at that reunion than they did in high school. 
More importantly, I will have my husband and best friend around for a long time, his wife says.
Follow Dale's '10 Commandmentsof bariatric surgery
1 -RRB- Set your goals early, both in pounds to lose and the date by which you want to achieve this loss. Keep a daily log or scorecard of your weight loss.
2 -RRB- Trial and error of foods and liquids will be necessary, but painful. Blueberries were terrible for me, but butter-free popcorn worked. Go figure. Hint: Keep your anti-nausea pills close by -- you will definitely need them in the beginning.
3 -RRB- Find a high-protein breakfast and lunch that you can live with each day. -LRB- Mine was Greek yogurt for breakfast and smoothies with strawberry, banana and chocolate protein. -RRB- Also, stay true to your vitamin regimen, especially vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium.
4 -RRB- Concentrate on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals per day, plus snacks, to five to six small meals.
5 -RRB- Stay hydrated ! It's very important that you avoid getting dehydrated, so avoid intake of caffeine, carbonated sodas, beer and alcohol.
6 -RRB- Move more while you are eating less. Start out walking 30 minutes, four to five days a week. Build up to walking farther and faster, and more often, while adding weight lifting two to three days per week. You will be amazed how fast the weight will start dropping once you get into this routine, plus your dog will love it even more than you !
7 -RRB- Start rewarding your new body with activities instead of food. Reward yourself by going to see a favorite performer if you hit a weight loss goal. Join a card club, start reading again, or make a movie date with your significant other each week. Replacing your going out to eat time with activities will arguably be the best move you will make during this whole journey.
8 -RRB- It's OK to leave food on your plate ! Regardless of what your mother said growing up, children in Africa, India or China are n't going to be affected if you leave food on your plate when eating at home or away. People will ask why, but trust me, you wo n't be hurting their feelings if you just say you 're full.
9 -RRB- Order an appetizer as your main meal when eating out. You will be amazed how full you will be after eating the smaller servings and your pocketbook will also thank you.
10 -RRB- And last, but definitely not least, welcome and embrace your support network, be it a wife, friend, business colleague, etc.. You will have good days and a few bad ones and the unconditional love and support these people will show you will help you push through the bad and be there to help celebrate the good !

"Most people don't know that the full name of the Statue of Liberty is ""The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World"". She is a symbol of freedom, especially for many immigrants. When many immigrants came to the United States in the late 1800s, Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was a sign to tell them that they had made it to America. Inside the base of the statue there is a plaque with a famous poem written on it. The poem is ""The New Colossus"" by Emma Lazarus. Many immigrants feel this poem speaks to them the reasons they came to America. One line of the poem is: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". Lady Liberty was not always green. She used to be copper colored, but the years have caused the copper that the statue is made of to change color.
 
The 151-foot tall sculpture was a 100th birthday gift from France to the United States in 1886. It is located on Liberty Island right off the southern tip of Manhattan, New York City. The only way to get there is to take a ferry. Inside the base of the statue is a museum. To get to the crown, people have to climb 377 steps up a double spiral staircase from the feet of the statue. There is no elevator. People need to be in good shape to climb to the top. People used to be able to climb up to the torch of the statue, but it was shut down because it was too easy to fall off.
About four million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year. People who can't go to New York can see replicas in Las Vegas and other parts of the world.",B1
"A Canadian man who sprang to fame after offering a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the jaunt with his chosen namesake, although, to the dismay of those following the story, love did not blossom between the pair. Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto real-estate developer turned charity founder, made it back to Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher but said the pair had ""forged a brother-sister-like relationship"". 
Axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher. He had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he was unable to change the name on the flights. 
That's where Axani's new travelmate, a 23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, came in. Gallagher, who goes by the name Quinn, replied to a Reddit post Axani had submitted - along with other hopeful Elizabeth Gallaghers - and was selected. Gallagher had made it clear before the trip that she had a ""pretty serious"" boyfriend but that had not stopped romantics, and journalists, from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. Unfortunately, it was not to be. 
""It wasn't easy and it certainly wasn't immediate. It took us about a week to really figure each other out,"" Axani said. There was a certain amount of ""natural stumbling"" around ""the dos and don'ts of travelling together"" as the pair got to know each other.
""I'm going to be explicitly clear,"" Axani said, shortly after the pair returned to Toronto. ""This was never a romantic endeavour. It was strictly platonic. I do not think of Quinn in a romantic light in the least. There is no future for us romantically. She is a good friend. I think of her as a little sister but that will be it. And her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard."" It took work to establish that brother-sister, good-friend, no-future-for-us-romantically relationship, however. other. ""At the end of it, we'd developed a really great rhythm of, one second, having really funny inside jokes, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space."" 
Although the pair failed to fall for one another, Axani said the trip, which took in Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was ""fantastic"". A favourite place was Prague, Axani said, where they ""had the largest groundswell of people reaching out"". 
""Over the course of two and a half days, I think we met about two dozen people. So that's a lot of stories, that's a lot of individuals and that's a lot of love for their home city of Prague."" 
People were following the pair on Twitter and Instagram, Axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in Hong Kong. ""It was a real adventure. We had a blast. We learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. I think, coming out of it, I can't imagine it going much better than it did."" 
Axani made it back to Toronto at 3am on Monday, 12 January, when the holiday came to an abrupt halt. He went straight into a board meeting with fellow board members at his charity, A Ticket Forward. Axani started the non-profit organization after his Reddit post went viral and intends to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war. 
Alongside that, Axani is also in talks to spin his story into a television show or film, although he would not comment on what form those productions might take. ""Suffice to say there's been significant interest from many production companies. We're well advanced."" In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher just yet. ""I'm not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and we'll see,"" he said. ""As always, life's a journey.""

"It was Laura's first Halloween in the United States. She had seen many portrayals of the late October holiday on television and in movies. She had to admit she was a little excited and nervous about the day. She was excited to see the costumes worn by kids ringing her doorbell; she was also worried about being scared by the costumes. She had watched too many horror movies.
 
Laura was renting a room in a house. Her landlady asked her if she could help with the candy. Laura happily agreed. The sun was just starting to set when the first group of kids in costumes rang the doorbell. ""Trick or treat!"" they said enthusiastically when Laura opened the door. The kids all had open bags. ""I want a treat!"" Laura said and grabbed the candy from each of the bag. The landlady came running to the door. ""No, Laura. You give the kids candy, not taking from them,"" she explained gently. Thankfully, none of the kids were upset. They just looked confused. The landlady suggested that Laura should go out with some friends to a local community Halloween carnival. She would handle giving out the candy by herself.
Laura went to her room to put on her witch costume. She walked to the local recreation center along with Joe and some other friends. The recreation center was decorated with fake spider webs and filled with artificial fog. ""We're going to egg some houses,"" Joe told her. She didn't know that throwing eggs was illegal. She just thought it was another Halloween tradition.
A few hours later, the landlady opened the door and found Laura accompanied by police. ""Trick or treat?"" Laura asked, looking embarrassed.

"Kobe Bryant is a professional basketball player, who played his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers. He first joined the team as a 17-year-old teenager in 1996. During the time, Bryant led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association titles. The most recent championship was in 2010, when the Lakers beat their arch rival, the Boston Celtics. The Lakers also won seven western conference titles and eight Pacific Division titles during Bryant's time.
 
The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA. They have appeared in 31 championship finals, more than any other teams in the league. The team has won more regular season games than any other franchise. It is clearly one of the premier NBA organizations, which came into existence in 1946.
Before Bryant, the Lakers already had some of the most notable superstars the league has ever known. Players such as George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Magic Johnson. Bryant had been central in establishing, and maintaining the legacy of this great team. He is the latest, and possible greatest of them all.
His individual statistics are astounding. He is the youngest player ever to score 30,000 points. He has been selected to the NBA's All Star team every year he has played, with the exception of his rookie season. He has won two Olympic Gold Medals in Basketball, leading the United States Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing, and in the London games of 2012. In 2006, Bryant became the 2nd player in the history of the game to score more than 80 points in a single game. Only Chamberlain has scored more. He holds several Laker individual records, including most seasons played, most All Star selections, most points scored, and most playoff games played.",B1
"What does it mean to be innovative in business?
In order for a business to survive in today's world, it is important that we regularly review what we are doing and how we are doing it. By considering new ideas and new ways of doing things, and trying to innovate, we can improve on our products/services, increase sales, reduce costs and make our processes more effective and efficient. Innovation is key to increasing profits.
There are several ways a company can be innovative with their products and services. Today we will look at four of them.
1. Using the latest technology to improve your product/service
When we think of innovation, we often think of new technologies. While they might be impressive, we should not use new technologies just because they are available. It is important to consider how the technology can improve our product/service and make a difference to our customer. Companies that produce cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. often have a large R&D department to work on making their products better.
2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer
By listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out about what it is that they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When fast-food restaurant McDonald's realised that the market wanted healthier choices, they introduced fruit and salads, while removing the 'super-size' option from their menus.
3. Offering a new product/service to reach new customers
Your business might be doing well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take away some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means developing a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by boys, in 2006, video games giant Nintendo introduced the game console Nintendo Wii, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.  
4. Changing the way you provide a service
By looking at the changes to the customer's lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realise that there might be better ways to serve them. Customers who do not have a lot of time might prefer to have their food or their shopping delivered to their homes, or they might like to do their banking online rather than in an actual bank.
Not all innovation will bring success to our businesses, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.",B1
"-LRB- CNN -RRB- More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste.
The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27.
Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January.
On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole, as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition.
Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty.
Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots.
Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder ?
Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty.
 I do n't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol, Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN.
The young Hernandez was the golden boy, playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community.
Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends.
 I saw a closeness with them that I 'd never seen before, Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father.
But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery.
Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow.
In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum.
The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot.
Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel.
At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting. 
The case remains open, and no one has been charged.
Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year.
Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel.
 If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season.... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test, he wrote, according to the Boston Globe.
Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first - or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him.
By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension.
Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder.
When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd did n't own a car.
Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who ?
Branch had his suspicions, but he could n't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night.
 He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money, Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night.
Lloyd's friends say he was n't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family.
Remembering Odin Lloyd
Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl.
On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.
Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he 'd see him later.
The next day, Lloyd's body was found.
Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima.
Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m..
At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with Nfl, adding, just so u know. 
Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene.
Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them.
Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty.
In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder.
As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense.
The jury would n't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with Nfl. The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state had n't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger.
Jurors also did n't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder.
Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink.
District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize. 
Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide
Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later.
After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said.
Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said.
He then pulled up to the victimscar at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court.
Hernandez allegedly said, Yo, what's up now, followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a.38 - caliber revolver, Haggan said.
Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said.
Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty.
Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

"Katherine loved Facebook. With Facebook she could keep in contact with her family no matter how far away they were. She could see photographs of her cousins and read status updates from her aunts and uncles. With Facebook she could keep her relatives up to date on what she was doing. With a few taps on the keyboard and hitting the send button, she could tell a dozen or more people about her new job. She could also send pictures so that they wouldn't worry that she wasn't eating enough or was unhealthy.
 
Another thing Katherine loved about Facebook was that she didn't have to think about time zones when updating family. Whenever she called her parents or other relatives, she always had to think about the time difference so that she wouldn't wake someone up or call when she knew they were at church. Facebook was so convenient.
Another thing happened when Katherine joined Facebook though. Some people she went to high school with started to add her as a friend. At first, this didn't bother her. She loved learning about the success of people she knew when she was just a teenager. She loved finding out people were getting married, having babies, and traveling.
Soon however, Katherine found herself comparing herself to the people she was reading about on Facebook. It began to make her feel bad that some people seemed to be doing so much better than she was. They had better jobs, nicer clothes, and cuter boyfriends. She was also spending a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's status updates.
Katherine started to think. She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook and realized some of them were not really friends at all.",B1
"My New Year's resolutions
by Darren
I like to start every year with my New Year's resolutions. Then I read them next 1 January and see how well I did!
Here are my resolutions this year.
1. Get fit!!
I say this every year but I hope writing it in public will make it more real. I'm aiming for three runs a week - I think I can do it! I think a fitness tracking app might help me achieve it. Or I could find a running partner. If anyone who's reading this wants to be my partner, let me know!
2. Save 10 per cent of my salary a month
Having no savings is starting to worry me and 10 per cent is realistic. It's not too much, but it's not too little that I won't see it add up. I'll put the money into a special bank account that will make it grow ... Actually, I don't know much about that so maybe my next resolution should be to find out how to invest money!!
3. Cook more
I'd like to start inviting friends for dinner and cooking for them. I think once a month is a good plan. By the end of the year I want to have five dishes I can cook really well so people will say, 'Have you ever had Darren's delicious cooking?' Who wants to be my first guest?",B1
"For 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt, the words mother and hero go hand in hand.
Three years ago Sunday Arrianna watched her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to buckle up and down. Thirteen people were killed in the bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. What Arrianna remembers most was the choice her mother made that day after the bus became tilted upward on a steep incline.
 Either you let us free fall -- or you hold that brake to the ground and you stay where you are. Dahl held the brake with her foot until she could reach for the parking brake.
Millions of viewers saw the jaw-dropping images of the school bus as it teetered on the edge of a broken stretch of highway, with nothing but a guard rail separating it from a deadly fall. Arrianna sat in the bus with her brother, 50 other children and eight adults.
The bus went up, and then it went down, Dahl recalls, adding it soon turned into free fall and she was hanging on for dear life.  I thought this is it,I 'm not getting out, and I 'm going to die. 
The new 35W bridge: Is it the safest in America ?
With the parking brake on, Dahl kept the bus in place while everyone made it out the rear emergency door safely. Arrianna, 10 at the time, and her then-5-year-old brother David, were the last ones and had refused to get off with the others.
 We did n't want to leave our mom, David, now 8, remembers.
 I 'm like get your butts off the bus, Dahl said. They eventually did.
Dahl says she managed to break free herself after a jolt on the bridge seemed to release her seatbelt, which had been stuck.
Since that day, those on the bridge and their loved ones have never been the same. This particular mother-daughter pair say they 've always had a tight bond but Arrianna says she and her mother have grown even closer since their ordeal.
 We 've always been close, but I think after the accident we got closer because we shared the same experience and we know what its like, Arrianna said.
The physical reminders of that day often overshadow the emotional ones.
 It does hurt to see my mom in pain because she cant do the things that she used to love to do. 
Dahl broke her back in the fall and that's been the primary cause of complications since.
 It's like a new me that I 'm living with, Dahl said. It's almost like your freedom is taken away... I ca n't go grocery shopping by myself because I ca n't lift the milk up and put it in the cart. 
 My kids and my husband -- I could n't ask for a better family, Dahl said. I mean my kids step up and do a lot of the work that I ca n't do or help me do things that I ca n't do. They 're pretty good about saying yea.
 I do n't know if life will ever be normal like it was before July of '07 and prior, but we 've made the best for it, said Dave Dahl. We 've adjusted our lives, we 've changed our lifestyles. But we 've just got to be positive. 
Dave Dahl reminds himself that things could have been worse. Our family unit here in this house is five people, he says. Within an instant it could have been two. 
Arrianna in particular has taken on a number of duties, like cleaning the bathrooms and doing the laundry, that she says has taught her how to be a grown-up. 
 Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings, Arrianna explains. The family also includes another daughter, Brianna, age 11.
 And my dad is working a lot of the time so he kind of does n't have much time. 
 It kind of teaches me to grow up some and how to be a grownup and what it's like. 
She adds it can get difficult once in awhile, but these days she simply reminds herself who she's doing it for.
 Now I kind of understand why I have to stand in and why sometimes I have to be the adult. 
Kim Dahl deals with PTSD, as well, and still sees a therapist twice a month. And while Arrianna no longer has therapy sessions of her own, occasionally she still struggles. Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who 've filed suit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction firm hired by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed. A federal investigative report blamed the collapse on support plates that were too thin, and increased weight on the bridge from construction equipment. The amount of punitive damages plaintiffs are seeking against URS is hard to say, said Dahl's attorney Bill Harper, who estimated it could be as much as $100 million. URS was hired by the state to make sure the integrity of the bridge was safe for the public, Harper said Wednesday. They did not do what they promised to do -- and as a result -- that bridge collapsed. Attorneys for URS said the company's work was unrelated to the causes of the bridge collapse.... URS did not design the bridge, was never asked to verify the bridge's original design, and did not know the bridge's original design was defective. Hennepin County District Judge Deborah Hedlund is expected to rule on punitive damages by mid-October. Painful reminders
On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands. The sound of a jackhammer in the distance is enough to remind Arrianna of the construction noise taking place on the bridge at the time of the accident. It brings her to tears.
Thankfully mom is nearby.
 She is kind of like my counselor because she listens, Arrianna said. She no longer needs a therapist, but it's these rare moments when mom comes in handy.
And occasionally, Arrianna says, their roles are reversed. She recalls hearing her mother sometimes say things about how life would be easier if none of this had ever happened.
Arrianna's advice ?
 You need to move on, and you need to be strong and live your life to the fullest. 
Those are words the family is living by. Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the wilder motor sports, and the five of them have taken on a new hobby: road trips.
Kim Dahl says she 'll never be able to drive a bus again -- something she misses more than anything. She had the same bus routes for years and knew the kids and their parents well.
But the family camper may be the next best thing. So far, they 've made it as far as Florida to the east and Colorado to the west.
 My mom could never afford it... we never went anywhere, Kim Dahl recalls of her childhood. And we went on -LSB- our -RSB- first trip and it was just awesome. To learn stuff and to see stuff was just amazing. 
As Dave Dahl describes it, there's no stress, there's no itinerary, nothing, we just go. 
 Wherever we get is where we get, he adds. We kind of have a goal of where we like to be in the end. 
Given the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have traveled since 2007, that phrase could be the family motto too.

"Most individuals don't think about numbers, or numerical representations of quantity, but they play a major part in everyday life. To be sure, numbers determine the time individuals will wake up in the morning, how much money employees earn per hour, what day of the year it is, and much, much more.
Additionally, numbers impact everyday living on a much smaller scale. In the grocery store, for instance, numbers determine products' prices, the amount of a product available for purchase, how much money will need to be paid for products, and a whole lot else.
To understand larger (and more intimidating numbers), interested persons first need to understand basic numbers, or numbers from one to ten, as they comprise each and every advanced number, or a multi-digit number that indicates a larger amount/quantity.
The basic numbers are as follows:
One (1)
Example: ""He purchased one watermelon from the grocery store.""
Two (2)
Example: ""She bought two types of bread from the store.""
Three (3)
Example: ""He decided to get three bags of onions when he went shopping.""
Four (4)
Example: ""In preparation for the party, Janice bought four cartons of ice cream at the store.""
Five (5)
Example: ""Joe picked up five boxes of cereal from the breakfast aisle.""
Six (6)
Example: ""A pound of beef costs a lot of money at my favorite grocery store.""
Seven (7)
Example: ""Seven of the 10 aisles at my local grocery store contain pasta.""
Eight (8)
Example: ""I bought eight cookies for the price of four at the store.""
Nine (9)
Example: ""There were only nine loafs of bread left at the grocery store.""
Ten (10)
Example: ""Ten pineapples sure is a lot, don't you think?""
After ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17), eighteen (18), nineteen (19), and twenty (20) follow. These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as most prices are 10 dollars or less; it is however worth knowing these numbers, generally and, in terms of grocery shopping, for when the bill must be paid.
After twenty, numbers such as twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75), and one hundred (100) follow. So long as one knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that determines the general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult. For example thirty-three (33) is simply ""thirty"" plus three; sixty-seven is ""sixty"" plus seven; and sixty-nine is simply ""sixty"" plus nine.",B1
"Two tank barges loaded with light crude oil struck a bridge in the Mississippi River early Sunday morning.
The Coast Guard said it was trying to determine how many gallons may have been spilled into the river near Vicksburg, Mississippi.
The tank that was leaking contained 80,000 gallons of oil.
A Coast Guard team has stopped the source of the spill, the agency said in a news release.
The river is closed from mile marker 425 to 441.
No one was injured in the accident, which happened at 1:30 a.m..
The Mississippi River at Vicksburg moves about 890,000 cubic feet of water per second, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If the vessel were to lose all its oil, that would be about 11,000 cubic feet.
In February 2012 a tanker barge spilled 10,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi after a collision near New Orleans. The Coast Guard drained the barge and towed it to a repair facility.

"Jenny is a fifth grader. She is considered one of the most popular girls in her class. She is very pretty, but that is not why she is considered popular. She is popular because she is known to be among the brightest in her class. She can do the most cartwheels in a row, but mostly, she has the talent to dance.
 
Last year, she entered the school's dance competition and won the first place. Her whole class was there to support her. Since that day, she has been the class attraction. This year, the school is holding another dance competition, but there has been a change in this year's competition. The competition has to be done in pairs.
Jenny's class was looking up to her with high expectations of her winning again this year. On the other hand, Jenny was unsure of this year's outcome. She wanted to enter the competition, but she had never danced with a partner before. She decided to ask some of the boys in her class to enter with her. They all said no to her because they did not know how to dance. Jenny was becoming hesitant about joining.
She finally decided to turn to one of her closest friends, Carl. Jenny and Carl had known each other since the first grade. Carl was reluctant to join at first because he also didn't know how to dance. Jenny insisted. He eventually agreed to join the competition. Jenny was happy and relieved. However, she was still worried because she knew her class was counting on her to win this year's competition.",B1
"Manhattan is a small island that is one part of New York City. New York City, ""the Big Apple"", is actually made up of five sections called boroughs. These boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx. Manhattan has the most people of all the boroughs, about 1.5 million, even though it is the smallest borough by size. If you send a letter to someone who lives on Manhattan, don't write Manhattan on the envelope. You should write ""New York, New York"", like the famous Frank Sinatra song.
 
Because the island is so small, most people live and work in tall buildings. Some of these buildings are called skyscrapers because it looks like they are touching the sky. Some famous skyscrapers in Manhattan are Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, 70 Pine Street, Trump Building, GE Building, and Citigroup Center. Manhattan is connected to the other boroughs by a series of bridges and tunnels. The most famous bridge may be the Brooklyn Bridge because of its brick arches. The New York City subway, a massive mass transit system that mostly runs underground, also connects the island to the rest of the boroughs.
Manhattan, like the other boroughs, has many different neighborhoods, many of which are named for the ethnic communities that first lived there. Some of these neighborhoods include Little Italy, Little Germany, Little Brazil, Chinatown, and Koreatown. One of the most famous parts of Manhattan is Times Square. Times Square is called the crossroads of the world. Every year millions of people gather there on New Year's Eve to watch an illuminated crystal ball drop. There are many theaters around Times Square. Most of these theaters are on Broadway, a famous street considered the home of the American theater industry. Another famous Manhattan street is Fifth Avenue. A part of the avenue features expensive designer stores like Tiffany's. Fifth Avenue is also famous for its Museum Mile.",B1
"While many women are involved in planning their bridal showers, a baby shower usually comes as a complete surprise. A baby shower is a party where a pregnant woman is ""showered"" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a close female friend or relative of the mother-to-be. Sometimes co-workers of a pregnant person will also throw a baby shower.
 
The baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9 months pregnant. Sometimes though, because predicting the due date of a baby isn't always exact, a baby shower can happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like with a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will often register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby including clothes, diapers and even furniture like high chairs and cribs. This way friends and family members can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15.
Some baby showers also feature a paper mache wishing well. This is not just for decoration. People can put cards inside with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also contain money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games at a baby shower. In one game everyone guesses the due date of the baby. Another game has people taste baby food and guess the flavor

Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing -- cricket.
On this night, locals gather at historic Kensington Oval, which hosted the 2007 World Cup final. There are no national teams on display this time, but there is a local trophy up for grabs.
It's enough to draw a large crowd of boisterous fans. In the concourse, a familiar face makes his way through the crowd.
He is Franklyn Stephenson, and he is the best to have never played for the West Indies, all because of one decision he and his teammates made 30 years ago.
It left each of them -- forever -- branded a rebel.
In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world. Team captain Clive Lloyd, from Guyana, had led them to back-to-back World Cup victories in 1975 and79.

Overflowing with talent, the islands of the West Indies could have fielded at least two teams of world-class players. But with all the hype and success, money did not follow. Playing international and club cricket was not enough to earn a living.
At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid. Its government's policies had split life into different classifications for whites and so-called non-whites.
Such oppression against the non-white population intensified into violence, landing young protesters like Nelson Mandela in jail. Thousands more were arrested or killed.
As the world tried to pressure South Africa's leadership, sanctions were applied, and sport was no exception.
In 1970, the International Cricket Council banned South Africa from international competition, leaving the country's cricket-mad fans deprived of the sport they loved, and their cricketers of the careers they dreamed of.
 You 're always optimistic, said former South African cricketer Clive Rice. The stupidity that existed would change and South Africa would change much quicker, and we 'd be back playing international sport. But it hung on and hung on. 
` Rebel tours '
To save cricket in South Africa, the sport's administrators knew something had to be done.
So, in secret, they began planning rebel tours -- inviting various teams from around the world.
It was a bold move to defy the ICC's ban by offering lucrative contracts. In March 1982, the first rebel team from England arrived in Johannesburg.
 From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricketers in the world, said former South African Cricket Union president Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel tour organizers. We wanted to show them off to the world so they would see it the same as we saw it. 
Later that year, a team from Sri Lanka followed.
And it was n't long before many began suspecting South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in world cricket.
 You heard a lot of whispers around the place that perhaps these guys were going to South Africa, recalled broadcaster Tony Cozier.
 But at that time, we could n't believe that they could assemble a team of West Indies players given the whole background to the anti-apartheid movement. 
Many big-name West Indies stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid South Africa.
Captain Clive Lloyd said no amount of money could get him there. Future captain Viv Richards called it blood money. 
But other players were tempted.
The offers from South Africa were more than they would likely see in their lifetimes -- estimated to be between $100,000 and $150,000 per player.
It was enough to draw in names like batsmen Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran, fast bowler Sylvester Clarke and wicketkeeper David Murray -- one of the best in the game.
Also agreeing to take part was Collis King, hero of the 1979 World Cup.
 I made the decision because I was n't getting treated right as far as the West Indies -LRB- team -RRB- was concerned, said King. And I said to myself, Well, cricket is my job. You 're not picking me, I 'll go play cricket someplace where people will see proper cricket.And that's why I went. 
More than just cricket
Rising star Stephenson was only 23 in 1983, with a promising career in front of him. He had repeatedly turned down offers to play in South Africa.
But the day the team left, Stephenson had a change of heart.
 I knew the tour was more important than being just cricket, Stephenson said. I believe that cricket can make a difference, and I 'm going to be a part of that team. 
On the plane, Stephenson recalled, some of the players began having second thoughts. But it was too late -- they were on their way to South Africa, to face apartheid head on.
 When we got to South Africa, I realized that separation, and it was n't only black and white, he said. It's the language that you speak, the area that you live in, and it's what you 're allowed to do, and where you can go. So the divisions were very real when we got there. 
Unsure of how they 'd be received by the country's mainly white fanbase, the West Indies rebels prepared for their first Test match.
But their worries soon proved unfounded -- in droves, crowds came out to see the famous cricketers.
 We packed them in, said Murray. We turned out 20,000 in Pretoria, the heart of apartheid. 
As the tour went on, the players began to believe something more important than just cricket was taking place.
Young kids -- white kids -- were begging them for autographs. It seemed South African fans could n't get enough of the black cricketers from the West Indies.
 For the first time, they were seeing blacks beating whites, said newspaper writer Al Gilkes, the only journalist from the Caribbean to go to South Africa.
 Here was a country in which no black man had ever seen a black person in competition with a white person, and beating them. To me, that was where the real victory was. 
` Destroyed as cricketers '
But critics of the tour disagree. They say the presence of a team of black men in South Africa did not help end apartheid, but instead strengthened and supported it.
Even within the country itself, non-whites protested the West Indies rebels.
Back home in the Caribbean, the reaction was worse. A deep sense of betrayal cut through the Caribbean. Cricketers who were once viewed as heroes were now seen as sellouts.
When the month-long tour was over, the rebel players knew they would have to face the repercussions of their decision back home.
 I felt sorry for them, said Gilkes, because I knew that they would never outlive what they were returning to. 
The fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control.
The players were aware they might face a ban -- after all, England's rebel team had been banned for three years; Sri Lanka's was banned for 25 years.
But they did not expect to be banned for life.
 Many of them were destroyed as cricketers, said University of West Indies Professor Hilary Beckles. Their cricket careers came to an end. 
Murray, once a star, is now drifting, unable to hold a job in Barbados. In the years after the tour, he eventually lost more than just his career.
His wife gave birth to their baby daughter in Australia, while Murray was playing in South Africa.
They faced being deported from Australia for his role in the rebel tours, and were unwelcome back in the Caribbean, too. They had a newborn, and nowhere to go.
 They did n't want me to return, Murray said. Politics got into it. 
When asked if his current situation resulted from his decision to go, Murray answered: Most likely. 
Mercenaries ?
For Stephenson, the once-rising star, his cricketing past is behind him. He is now a golf instructor at a country club in Barbados.
But he still finds a way to connect to the sport he loved at the cricket and golf academy he started near his home.
There, a photo of his rebel team sits proudly on the shelf. It is not the memories of the tour he wants to forget, but what came after.
 Nobody looked out for us, Stephenson said.
For the players, their lives defined by this single moment in sport history, each day is a reminder of what they lost by going to South Africa.
But they gained something, too -- strong bonds forged on a tour condemned by the rest of their world, cherished by the participants.
And to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there.
Gilkes wrote a seven-part series about the tour. In the last article, he stated the trip might have started with the players being viewed as mercenaries, but he saw them as missionaries who converted white South Africans to accepting that blacks were their equals. 
 I know I went there as a missionary, King said.
Murray agreed. I do n't see the mercenary part of it or whatever. We were just professional cricketers. You 've got work to do. 
 What do mercenaries do ? Stephenson asked. They go and fight somebody else's cause.
 Well, yes I was a mercenary for black people's cause, because wherever I 've been, I 've been an ambassador for my country, my race and the game of cricket. So if that's being a mercenary, then yes I was.

"Improvements to Oak Hall
Introduction
This report aims to describe problems in Oak Hall of Residence and discuss possible maintenance work to solve them. The two biggest issues were discussed at a meeting on 12 May, which was attended by 165 of the 250 students who live in the building.
Issue 1: temperature in rooms
A number of students complained that the second-floor bedrooms are too hot. Concerns were raised about lack of sleep and students finding it hard to study in their rooms. Air conditioning was suggested as a possible solution.
However, there is no budget left for installing air conditioning this academic year. Also, installation can only be carried out during holidays as students cannot be present in the building while the work takes place.
Issue 2: improving wheelchair access to Oak Cafe
It was noted that wheelchair users can only access Oak Cafe from the back and not the front entrance nearer the lifts. This makes access to the cafe difficult for wheelchair users. The university is looking to improve its wheelchair access in general by installing ramps in key areas and work can take place during term time with no issues for staff or students.
Conclusion and recommendations
Taking the factors mentioned into account, August would be the best time for the installation of air conditioning. Until then, the university could consider supplying fans to each second-floor room so students can sleep and study comfortably.
The front of the cafe is recommended as an ideal place to install a wheelchair ramp. This work can take place immediately and should be a priority.",B1
"Add your comment below:
So cool to read about everyone's home tradition they miss the most! I'm from England but I've been living in the States for five years and the thing I miss the most is Bonfire Night on November 5th.
The best thing about Bonfire Night is the fireworks, oh, and the bonfires! ... and the history behind it. Basically, Guy Fawkes and his friends tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I. They nearly did it too - they hired a room under the House of Parliament and filled it with explosives. But someone told the royal palace. The authorities found Guy Fawkes in the room guarding the explosives, and he was sentenced to torture and death.
So it's a tradition that celebrates the fact that the king survived. It also means people don't forget what happens if you plot against your country. There's a kind of poem about it that starts 'Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot.' That's why we build a 'guy' - a life-size model of Guy Fawkes - and burn it on the bonfire. Pretty dark and horrible when you think about it!",B1
"Andrea's acne was getting worse by the day. Not only did it not look good, but it made her feel self-conscious. She wanted to go see a dermatologist about her skin condition. Andrea had health insurance trough her job. When she signed up for the health plan, she chose a primary care physician. That doctor would take care of Andrea's basic health needs. The primary care physician was not a dermatologist though. If Andrea wanted the health insurance to pay for the dermatologist, she first needed to make an appointment with her regular physician. Otherwise, Andrea would have to pay out of her own pocket to see a dermatologist.
 
Andrea called her primary care provider. She had to wait a week for an appointment since her acne was not an emergency. When it was time for the appointment, she showed her doctor the acne problem. Her primary care physician was able to prescribe a skin cream for Andrea. Andrea used that skin cream for a week, but her acne did not get any better. She called her doctor back. The doctor couldn't do anything else for her. So the doctor gave her a referral to see a skin specialist, a dermatologist.
Andrea called the dermatologist, but she had to wait another three weeks for an appointment. Her acne had gotten worse over these three weeks. When she finally saw the dermatologist, he ran a number of blood tests and allergy tests. The dermatologist told Andrea that the acne was actually an allergic reaction to fried foods. Andrea thought it was a lot of trouble to finally find out what was wrong. She was happy though now that she knew all she had to do was not to eat fried food, which was not good for her waistline or her skin.",B1
"Over the past week, I 've been inundated with questions about swine flu, via Facebook, Twitter, CNN blogs and e-mail. So this week I 'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect yourself, what all the numbers mean and why you should n't freak out.
The most recnt advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided.
1. Has n't swine flu been around for a while ?
Yes. Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig. In 1976, more than 200 soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, got swine flu. From 1976 until 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received approximately one report every year or two of humans with swine flu. From December 2005 until January 2009, there were 12 cases of swine flu reported.
2. The folks who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people ?
It appears that no one in the United States with swine flu had any contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said in a news conference Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. In another press conference Monday, he added that investigators have looked to see whether any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and we 're not finding that linkage here. 
3. Swine flu is transmitted from animals to humans. Does that happen a lot ?
Yes. More than 200 zoonotic diseases are transmitted from animals to humans, including illnesses caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- better known as mad cow disease -RRB- are two well-known examples.
4. Should I cancel my trip to Mexico ?
Yes, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice from a recent CDC travel warning. Watch Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions 
5. Should I be freaking out ?
A new virus spreading quickly around the world. Young, healthy people struck dead in Mexico. Should we all be panicking ?
 Absolutely not, said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Swine flu, he said, is not spreading all that rapidly. Take the St. Francis School in New York. There's been very little transmission from the schoolchildren to family members, and it certainly has n't spread throughout Queens. iReport.com: Share your thoughts, concerns about swine flu
But, Schaffner added, this does n't mean we should n't pay attention to swine flu. We should be alert, keep up with the information coming out daily, and take control by being attentive to your hygiene. Wash your hands very, very frequently and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing. 
6. How close do you have to be to a sick person to get swine flu ?
 You can acquire this infection if you 're within the breathing zoneof a sick person, which is about three to six feet, Schaffner said. And we usually mean being this close to someone in a confined space. We 're not talking about fleeting contact. We 're not talking about walking past someone in the street. You need sustained contact. If you think you might have sustained contact with someone who's ill, read this guidance from the CDC's Web site.
7. Yikes ! Every day I 'm that close to countless people -- at work, on the bus, at church, in a movie theater. Could I get swine flu from them ?
Yes.
 If you 're standing next to someone on a bus, or sitting next to someone or in front of someone in a theater, you could acquire the infection in that fashion, Schaffner said. That's why people with the symptoms of any kind of flu -- fever, diarrhea, body aches, vomiting, etc. -- are urged to stay home and away from groups of people.
8. Was n't there a vaccine at one time ? Is there one now ?
Yes, a swine flu vaccine was given to 45 million people in 1976. There is no vaccine now, although researchers are working on one.
The 1976 vaccine would n't be helpful anyway, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy & Infectious Diseases.
 That was a completely different virus than the virus we are dealing with right now, completely different in the sense that the genes are different, and it does n't have any relationship, said Fauci. The designation of each one was called the swine flu, but from a viral standpoint and spreading it is quite, quite different. 
Here are two scientific articles about the swine flu outbreak and vaccination program in 1976:
- Reflections on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination Program
- Swine Influenza A Outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976
9. Many young, healthy people have become sick in the United States. Many of the dead in Mexico have been young and healthy. What's going on ? Usually we think of flu as affecting the very young and the very old.
This sometimes happens with new viruses. For example, in 1918 when a new flu virus emerged, many of those stricken were young and healthy. One theory is that young people, who have strong immune systems, mount a particularly vigorous response to new viruses. But there's a potential side effect to the response: the body releases dangerous levels of signaling proteins, called cytokines, which can damage the lungs. Scientists believe these cytokine storms can be fatal.
Here is a scientific article about the proposed mechanism of cytokine storms.
10. Why are large numbers of people dying in Mexico, but not in other countries ?
This is the big mystery doctors are trying to solve right now. Many infectious disease experts say it's most likely a matter of numbers: with more illnesses in Mexico, there are also more deaths. Other explanations: that in Mexico people have, in addition to swine flu, other viruses that make for a more deadly combination than swine flu alone. It's also possible that the virus infecting the rest of the world is a weaker version than the one in Mexico. Among the swine flu mysteries: Why only deaths in Mexico ?
11. Could this new swine flu virus have been manufactured by bioterrorists ?
That's the theory on some conspiracy theoristsWeb sites. But experts do n't believe it.
 If you were a bioterrorist you 'd want to create something that's a lot more deadly than this, said Dr. Gerald Evans, an associate professor of microbiology at Queen's University in Canada. The problem with influenza is that the second you put it into people, it replicates and mutates very quickly. Even if you created the perfect bioweapon, within a few generations of transmissions, it would n't do what you planned for it to do. 
12. I get a flu shot every fall. Will that help protect me against swine flu ?
 The short answer is that the CDC says it's very unlikely, Schaffner said. But he said it might be possible. I think it's a bit of an open question whether repeated flu shots over years would provide a measure of protection. 
13. I was in Mexico two weeks ago. Could I have contracted swine flu, and the symptoms just have n't shown up yet ?
No. The incubation period of the swine flu is one to seven days.
 If you just traveled to Mexico and you 're home and feeling well you should get on with your daily life and not worry about it, Evans said.
14. Can the swine flu virus live on inanimate objects ? If someone with swine flu touches a doorknob, then I touch it, could I get swine flu ?
Flu viruses can live on inanimate surfaces. So theoretically, you could get swine flu from touching a doorknob that was just touched by an infected person. However, that's pretty unlikely, according to Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.
 I personally would not have a major fear of environmental contamination, he said. Virtually all influenza is transmitted from sneezing and coughing. 
Schaffner agrees, adding that flu viruses do n't survive in large numbers on surfaces. A doorknob is n't a warm, nourishing environment for a virus, he said.
15. What should I do if I develop symptoms of swine flu ?
Call your doctor -- do n't just drive on over, Schaffner advised. Follow the instructions of your doctor. He might not want you in the waiting room spreading germs to others, he said.

"To the unaccustomed eye, a man toting 120 books while riding a stubborn donkey would seem nothing short of a circus spectacle. But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown. He is a man with a mission to save rural children from illiteracy.
 There was a time when many people thought that I was going crazy, said Soriano, a native of La Gloria, Colombia. They 'd yell, Carnival season is over.... Now I 've overcome that. 
Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a biblioburro, a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as abandoned regions in the Colombian state of Magdalena.
 In -LSB- rural -RSB- regions, a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to reach the closest schools, Soriano said. The children have very few opportunities to go to secondary school.... There are -LSB- few -RSB- teachers that would like to teach in the countryside. 
Do you know a hero ? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes
At the start of his 17-year teaching career, Soriano realized that some students were having difficulty not just learning, but finishing their homework assignments. Most of the students falling behind lived in rural villages, where illiterate parents and lack of access to books prevented them from completing their studies.
To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children.
 I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea -LSB- to use -RSB- them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load, Soriano said. I put the books on their backs in saddles and they became my work tools. 
Every Wednesday at dusk and every Saturday at dawn, Soriano leaves his wife and three young children to travel to select villages -- up to four hours each way -- aboard a donkey named Alfa. A second donkey, Beto, follows behind, toting additional books and a sitting blanket. They visit 15 villages on a rotating basis.
 It's not easy to travel through the valleys, Soriano said. You sit on a donkey for five or eight hours, you get very tired. It's a satisfaction to arrive to your destination. 
At each village, some 40-50 youngsters await their chance to get homework help, learn to read or listen to any variety of tall tales, adventure stories and geography lessons Soriano has prepared.
 You can just see that the kids are excited when they see the biblioburro coming this way. It makes them happy that he continues to come, said Dairo Holguin, 34, whose two children take part in the program. For us, his program complements what the children learn in school. The books they do not have access to... they get from the biblioburro. 
More than 4,000 youngsters have benefited from Soriano's program since it began in 1990. Soriano says countless others have been helped, too; parents and other adult learners often participate in the lessons.
Soriano has spent nearly 4,000 hours riding his donkeys, and he's not traveled unscathed. In July 2008, he fractured his leg when he fell from one of the donkeys; in 2006, he was pounced on by bandits at a river crossing and tied to a tree when they found out he had no money. Despite these injuries, which left him with a limp, Soriano has no intention of slowing down.
In addition to the biblioburro program, he and his wife built the largest free library in Magdalena next to their home. The library has 4,200 books, most of which are donated -- some from as far away as New York City. They also run a small community restaurant.
Soriano's hope is that people will understand the power of reading and that communities can improve from being exposed to books and diverse ideas.
 For us teachers, it's an educational triumph, and for the parents -LSB- it's -RSB- a great satisfaction when a child learns how to read. That's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person, Soriano said. Literature is how we connect them with the world.

"For most people, an ideal morning might consist of waking up to the warm sun creeping in through the bedroom window, along with the cheerful chirping of the birds from a nearby tree. Sadly, this is not the case for Michael, a part-time student that works late nights as a warehouse manager. Michael gets home around 2:00 a.m. every night, and heads straight to bed to get as much sleep as possible until his classes start at 10:00 a.m. However, for the past week, Michael has had a new ""alarm clock"" that he unfortunately has no control of. It is an energetic, loud, mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new home.
 
Each morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late into the night. Most city birds begin the day with sweet, gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then imitates. This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.
After one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do something. ""Go away!"" he screamed out his window. When that didn't work, he started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. This only made the bird get even louder! As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. ""We can't do that,"" replied the Animal Control Specialist. ""Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature.""
Furious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week. Only five minutes later he awoke to a thunderous ""caw-caw!"" coming from outside.",B1
"Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you need to figure out how much you can pay per month.
 
When you first move into a new place, most landlords, or property owners expect you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money you pay a landlord sort of as insurance that you won't destroy their property while you are living there. Usually the security deposit is equal to the amount of one-month rent. If when you move out, the apartment is in the same condition as when you moved in, the landlord will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any damage whatsoever, including holes in the walls because you hung up posters, the landlord can legally use that money to fix the apartment.
Once you know how much you can afford, you can begin looking for apartments for rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk around a neighborhood you want to live in and be on the lookout for ""For Rent"" signs.
There are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more than a month at a time.",B1
"The Cinco de Mayo, or Fifth of May, is a holiday celebrated by Mexicans in the United States. Before 1776, much of the southern and western states, such as Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and California were part of Mexico. Following the war between the U.S. and Mexico in the 1800s, these states became part of the United States, but there still remained a very large Mexican population.
 
The Latino population is the largest, single ethnic group in the country. It accounts for 17 percent of the nation's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos are of Mexican origins. The Cinco de Mayo is a large celebration in the country's southwest region. It celebrates the Mexican victory in the Battle of Puebla, against France on May 5, 1862. Curiously, the day is celebrated more in the United States than it is in Mexico itself.
In Los Angeles, the city celebrates the event with the Fiesta Broadway, which is the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world. More than half a million people come to downtown L.A. to participate in the street fair that covers 24 square blocks. The celebration takes place on the last Sunday of April. There are rides, games, and especially food at this celebration and it is growing every year. Los Angeles is not the only Southland city to host Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The cities of Corona, West Los Angeles, and Commerce also have events, and the famous Olvera Street celebration in downtown L.A. is also very popular.
One of the most unique Cinco de Mayo events takes place in the Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. It is called the Single de Mayo. This celebration is an annual charity event that began in 1999. It is a private party that benefits the homeless by providing shelter and support. Cinco de Mayo is a truly American celebration.",B1
"The chart shows the sales revenue of a selection of home video entertainment formats in the USA in 2017. It also shows the percentage change from the previous year.
Online video streaming was the most popular format in 2017. US consumers spent $9.8 billion on services such as Netflix, which was a rise of 32 per cent from the previous year. For the average American, this accounted for nearly half of their spending on video entertainment at home.
At the same time, customers were moving away from the three physical formats in the chart. DVD and Blu-ray sales dropped by 14 per cent over the twelve-month period to $4.5 billion in 2017, and rent-by-post revenues went down by 20 per cent to $0.5 billion. DVD rental shops saw the largest decline, as spending fell by 21 per cent to just $0.4 billion.
Overall, there was a clear downward trend in spending on physical video formats, as they all showed relatively low sales and they were all in decline. However, there was an upward trend in paying for streaming.

"A kidnapping suspect provided information that led to the discovery of the bodies of a missing Ohio woman, her 10-year-old son and a family friend, authorities said Thursday.
The remains of Tina Herrmann, 32, her 10-year-old son, Kody Maynard, and her 41-year-old friend Stephanie Sprang were found in trash bags placed in the hollow of a tree, Knox County Sheriff David Barber said. Hearses left a wilderness area northwest of the town of Fredericktown in Knox County.
Herrmann's daughter, Sarah Maynard, 13, was found alive Sunday morning in Mount Vernon, about 50 miles northeast of Columbus.
Matthew Hoffman, 30, who lives in the home where Sarah Maynard was found, provided the information that led to the discovery of the three bodies, Barber said. Hoffman currently faces a kidnapping charge in the abduction of Sarah Maynard, Barber said.
Hoffman has experience as a tree trimmer, the sheriff said.
 I have never experienced anything this big, this serious and this tragic, said Barber, who announced the news at a somber press conference.
When asked if officials took the death penalty off the table in order to receive information on the location of the bodies, Knox County prosecutor John C. Thatcher replied that he could not say whether Hoffman had confessed to the killings.
The county coroner will conduct autopsies and provide information to prosecutors, officials said.
Thatcher said he is not sure yet what charges the evidence will support, but he expects to take the case to the grand jury within four to six weeks.
A judge on Tuesday set a $1 million bond for Hoffman, who is accused of keeping Sarah bound and gagged in his basement, authorities said. The suspect has a November 23 preliminary hearing on the kidnapping charge, authorities said.
A message left Thursday night with public defender Bruce Malek was not immediately returned.
Barber said earlier this week that authorities were fortunate to find Sarah, but he said blood evidence found in Herrmann's home coupled with the amount of time the three have been missing had made the situation more serious.
The girl was at the Herrmann residence, but Barber did not indicate whether she saw the slayings.
The bodies were found about 20 miles from the Herrmann home.
Sarah Maynard was found in an early morning raid involving a SWAT team and was released from the hospital Monday, after being evaluated and treated for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening, the sheriff said.
 Sarah is with family and is doing well. said Barber. She is a very brave little girl, he said.
The disappearance of the three residents November 10 prompted a weeklong search throughout the rural region. But, in the end, the crucial information came down to Hoffman, Barber said.
 His information led to the location of the bodies, the sheriff said.
 We are a small community here. We became close to the victimsfamilies, Barber said Thursday. We have to take care of the survivors. 
Police said Tuesday they did not believe Hoffman was working with an accomplice. When asked whether the incident was a home invasion, Barber said it was not, but added that either they knew Hoffman or Hoffman made himself known to them. 
Herrmann failed to report to work at a Dairy Queen in Mount Vernon, in central Ohio, on November 10, Barber told CNN affiliate WBNS. A deputy twice went to her home in Howard, about nine miles east of Mount Vernon, and saw her pickup there. No one answered the door, though lights were on in the home.
A Dairy Queen manager went into the home on November 11 and found blood inside, Barber told the station.
Asked about Hoffman's criminal record, Barber said he served prison time for an arson conviction in another state.
Dawna Davis, who lives next to Hoffman, said she did not trust him.
 He was just different. He was odd. He just climbed trees and watched us, she said about Hoffman.

"It is estimated that about 40 per cent of the world's population use social media, and many of these billions of social media users look up to influencers to help them decide what to buy and what trends to follow.
So what is an influencer and how do we become one?
An influencer is a person who can influence the decisions of their followers because of their relationship with their audience and their knowledge and expertise in a particular area, e.g. fashion, travel or technology.
Influencers often have a large following of people who pay close attention to their views. They have the power to persuade people to buy things, and influencers are now seen by many companies as a direct way to customers' hearts. Brands are now asking powerful influencers to market their products. With some influencers charging up to $25,000 for one social media post, it is no surprise that more and more people are keen to become influencers too. If you are one of them, then here are five tips on how to do it.
1. Choose your niche
What is the area that you know most about? What do you feel most excited talking about? Find the specific area that you're most interested in and develop it.
2. Choose your medium and write an interesting bio
Most influencers these days are bloggers and micro-bloggers. Decide which medium - such as your own online blog, Instagram or Snapchat - is the best way to connect with your followers and chat about your niche area. When you have done that, write an attention-grabbing bio that describes you and your speciality area in an interesting and unique way. Make sure that people who read your bio will want to follow you.
3. Post regularly and consistently
Many influencers post daily on their social media accounts. The more you post, the more likely people will follow you. Also, ensure that your posts are consistent and possibly follow a theme.
4. Tell an interesting story
Whether it is a photo or a comment that you are posting, use it to tell a story that will catch the attention of your followers and help them connect with you.
5. Make sure people can easily find your content
Publicise your posts on a variety of social media, use hashtags and catchy titles and make sure that they can be easily found. There is no point writing the most exciting blogposts or posting the most attractive photographs if no one is going to see them.
Most importantly, if you want to become a social media influencer, you need to have patience. Keep posting and your following will gradually increase. Good luck!",B1
"There is perhaps no greater mystery in the annals of American history as that of the Amelia Earhart story. Earhart's story is one of controversy, and intriguing. She was an accomplished aviator, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She accomplished this during a time when women were not highly regarded in the United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages men had. There were few employment opportunities. Educated women were a scarcity. Women who did find employment during this era were working as grade-school teachers, nannies, and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to change that perception.
 
Although Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, but that success was fleeting. There were times in her life when her family struggled to make ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was home schooled for most of her life, and she gained her pilots license at an early age. In December of 1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an airshow in Long Beach, California. This is where she first became interested in flying. After earning her aviator's license, she accomplished a feat that only a few men had ever done: flying solo across the Atlantic. She earned national fame for this and was soon a household name.
Tragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. She was never found. The theories about how she met her end are countless. Many think she fell victim to the Japanese prior to the start of World War II. This thinking was rooted in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other outlandish theories include alien kidnapping, but most likely she had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart was either killed instantly, or survived, according to one popular theory, and lived out her days on a deserted island.",B1
"There was a time in the United States when black people were not allowed to play the game of baseball with white players. That was before the great Jackie Robinson broke what was called the color line in baseball. Prior to April 15, 1947, Major League Baseball was an exclusive ""whites only"" organization that barred black players from participation. Black Americans could only play in the Negro Leagues that existed roughly between 1920 through 1948. Robinson, and the Brooklyn Dodgers, put an end to segregation in baseball that year, and began a movement for racial equality in the United States.
 
Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919, but grew up in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles. He was an outstanding athlete who played baseball and football for Pasadena City College, then at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During his time with the Dodgers, the team won one championship, and appeared in the World Series six times. From 1949 to 1954, Robinson was named to the All-Star Team, and he won the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947, the first year the award was given.
Today, Robinson is honored by every team in both the National and American Leagues on Jackie Robinson Day. On that day, all MLB players wear the number 42 in honor of Robinson. That number, used to be worn by Robinson, was retired universally by all baseball teams, making it the first time any league has retired a number. No player on any MLB team can ever wear that number again. Robinson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962. He died on October 24, 1972, and was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal for his part in changing American society.",B1
"It was the morning after Julia's first Thanksgiving in the United States. The night before, she had a huge dinner with her friend Elizabeth's family. Before eating roast turkey, sweet potatoes, and cranberry sauce, each person at the table had to say something they were grateful for. Julia appreciated that she was able to participate in this holiday that recalls the Pilgrims' first harvest after arriving from England a long time ago.
 
Julia's phone rang at four in the morning. It was Elizabeth. Elizabeth invited Julia to go shopping with her. ""We are going to the stores so early?"" Julia asked sleepily. Elizabeth explained that the day after Thanksgiving in the United States was called Black Friday. Stores, which held special sales, started very early. ""It's the official start of the holiday shopping season,"" Elizabeth explained.
Julia and Elizabeth were outside the local shopping center by five in the morning. Julia was surprised to see that not only were all the stores open, but they were crowded. Elizabeth told Julia that this was nothing. Some people camped outside the mall all night so that they could be among the first to enter and get extra special deals called ""door busters"". Many times these ""door busters"" were electronic items at extremely reduced prices. Often only a small number of these items are made available. Sometimes they are only available to the first 100 people in line.
Julia thought it sounded violent and wondered aloud if people really broke down doors to get into the store. ""Sometimes there is a lot of pushing,"" Elizabeth explained. Some people have even been hurt, or killed, because of physical fights over limited products. At 5 a.m. though, the door busters were gone and the cash registers had long lines. Many shoppers had full shopping carts of presents they intended to give away for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa.",B1
"Not nearly enough exercise classes have a tea break halfway through. But Margaret Allen's does. After a gentle warm-up and a few pulse-raising numbers, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down. 
Some of the eight-strong class look as if they need it more than others. Allen herself, wearing a thick turquoise shirt, navy knitted waistcoat, black slacks and sensible shoes, has not broken into a sweat. Despite an ""excruciating"" trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks as though she could go on for hours. 
The general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea, let alone part way through. But, on the afternoon I visit Allen's class at a church hall in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. The cake has been baked in honour of Allen's recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, Joan, known locally as the ""scone queen of Saltburn"". 
The ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when Allen is up again, leading the group through a jaunty Scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. Forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over. 
Allen, a former volunteer with the Red Cross, has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years. Not particularly sporty at school, she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war - ""just for something to do during the blackouts, really"" - and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired. At its peak, Allen's class had more than 18 regulars, each paying GBP1 a time. But, these days, her flock is diminishing fast - during the teabreak, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68, from motor neurone disease. 
Allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. The baby of the group is 60-year-old Jean Cunion, who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died. She is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. ""I remember, the first time I came, Margaret said: 'Who's that huffing and panting?' and I had to admit it was me."" Ruth Steere, 76, marvels at how Allen never misses a trick, despite always having her back to the class: ""She always shouts at us if we go wrong. She's remarkably good at knowing what we are doing."" 
Allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. Instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the BBC's first ever fitness guru, Eileen Fowler, who died in 2000 when she was 93, Allen's age now. Allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy, especially since her husband Joe died in 1997. She took up writing poetry when she was 80. 
""I write poems about everything. I'm a prolific writer. I just can't stop,"" she says, phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise. One of the class, 84-year-old former teacher Winnie Robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: ""Use it or lose it, that's what I say."" 
Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. She is president of the Women's Fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90-plus year olds at the scrabble club of the University of the Third Age. She did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online, but it didn't work out. 
Ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called 'That Beast Called Age'. She happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back, who said she couldn't possibly be more than 78: ""I said, 'Thank you, doctor. You can go now.'"" 
She also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: ""I just think people shouldn't eat too much. Whenever I hear someone saying, 'Oh, I can't lose weight', I say:' Sellotape.'"" She mimes taping her mouth shut. ""I said this just the other day to a big fat man. Everything in moderation is my motto."" 
Earlier in 2013, Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal. I think she means Margaret Chartwood from Horley, who was given the honour in January, at the age of 77. ""She was saying: 'I'm 80 and I'm the oldest fitness instructor in the country!' I was thinking: 'No, you're not.' But I shan't be writing to Buckingham Palace.""

"Classic rock band Cheap Trick got a scare Sunday night at the Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest.
The stage gave way while the band was playing, after severe weather moved into the area.
No one was seriously hurt.
 The stage blew down and collapsed, a statement on the band's website said. Everyone is shaken up but band and crew are all fine. 
Manager Dave Frey confirmed for CNN that the band was unharmed.
 One of our drivers will spend the night in the hospital and though we 're not sure how, Cheap Trick are grateful and happy to say that everyone, including all the concert goers, are okay, Frey said.
A picture on the band's website showed a tangle of metal girders under a darkly overcast sky.
The website for the Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest said there were no serious injuries. It also said that severe weather had forced the closure of all venue stages for the night.
Cheap Trick is best known for its hits Surrender  Dream Police and I Want You To Want Me.

"What is it about Christmas music that enters our very souls, calms us and even gets us to do things that are right for humanity ? This music even has the ability to make us like our old Aunt Emily. If there were a marketing campaign for Christmas, it would be the most successful campaign ever devised.
Paintings of angels protecting sheep or a masterly rendition of the manger scene certainly evoke emotion. Then there's a good Christmas story. In 1843, Charles Dickens gave us A Christmas Carol. This literary gift had the power to make us actually give a farthing or two to the needy.
However, it is music and song that has no rival in the ability to stir raw emotions. It does n't matter what your religious persuasion is. Most people can recite and hum the Christmas carols they 've heard repeatedly since childhood.
Among the most familiar are the pop songs: Santa Claus is Coming To Town, which the Four Seasons, Bruce Springsteen and Bing Crosby all performed; Gene Autry's Here Comes Santa Claus ; Elvis Presley's Blue Christmas ; and Brenda Lee's RockinAround the Christmas Tree. 
Then there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- I 'll Be Home for Christmas -- and the line, if only in my dreams. I forgot how lonely and depressed I was until I heard that song. The home for Christmas notion originates during World War I, when U.S. soldiers expected a quick victory, thinking they 'd be back in the United States in time for the holidays. That was not the case, and the song was a huge hit decades later -- in 1943. Speaking of hits, there's White Christmas -- more than 500 different recordings were made of this song; which was originally written for the movie Holiday Inn. 
These songs conjure up old family photos of relatives here and long gone. We say, Oh my, look here's an old tintype of Aunt Emily -- she was so kind and generous. -LRB- Even if we never really liked her -- but then, it's Christmas. -RRB-
Next up are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with the holiday. Once again, those marketers have honed their skills at pulling our sentimental heartstrings. Dean Martin singing Let It Snow ! Let it Snow ! Let it Snow ! Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark doing Baby, it's Cold Outside. -LRB- This song of trying to entice a young lady to stay was written for the film Neptune's Daughter, with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban. -RRB-
Judy Garland singing Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas in the 1944 film Meet Me In St. Louis and dozens more all have great images, and are all seasonal. Did you know that Jingle Bells was originally titled One Horse Open Sleigh and was written in the late 1850s by James Pierpont, to be performed during a Thanksgiving service at his Unitarian church in Savannah, Georgia ? The congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during Christmas services, and Jingle Bells took off from there.
Of course, Christmas is children. There are the novelty songs written for kids -- like the one about the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph. He came prancing into our lives when we were young with his shiny red nose and never left the roof. Then there are Jimmy Boyd's All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth , The Singing Dogs version of Jingle Bells and Homer and Jethro's Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer. Songs only a kid could like.
But my favorite has to be Lou Monte's Dominic the Italian Christmas Donkey. And how about I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas, by Gayla Peevey ? Somebody please explain why anybody would buy that song.
So here's the question: What is this all about ? The emotional and often wonderful snapshots of our lives, past and present, all wrapped up for Christmas. Have we been duped into loving this holiday ? Absolutely not.
I realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little Christmas. The security of home, family and friends is essential.
So this marketing campaign that started with our first footsteps is fine -- we need it. Is there a Santa Claus ? Have I been a good boy ? Or, as Nat King Cole famously asked: Do reindeer really know how to fly ? Yes, of course, to all those questions. Would n't it have been nice if those marketing guys figured out a way to make those 12 days of Christmas last for the other 353 days of the year ?
So deck the halls and please stop leaving Santa those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight during the past 200-plus years. And I say unto ye -- Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Happy holidays, cousins.

"Many wept. Some prayed. But after their smoke-filled plane rattled to an emergency landing, passengers had a new lease on life, as they exited a JetBlue flight Thursday via inflatable chutes.
 I 'm just happy to be alive, said passenger Jarrod West, who slid down holding his black Chihuahua. I do n't think I 'll be mean to anybody ever again. 
Four people were injured in the incident; one was taken to hospital, CNN affiliate KCAL reported.
A loud pop initiated the brush with disaster, said West and other passengers who spoke with KCAL from the airport in Long Beach, California.
Flight 1416 had left Long Beach Airport about 15 minutes before and was over the ocean, carrying 147 passengers and crew headed for Austin, Texas.
Then the right engine blew, JetBlue told KCAL.
A signal alerted pilots that an engine was overheating, fire department spokesman Jake Heflin told KCAL. The pilots deployed extinguishers.
Thick smoke filled cabin
Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and child. Our right engine exploded and our cabin filled with smoke, he posted to Twitter.
It grew so thick that passengers could no longer see the people seated next to them, said passenger Jonathon Hubbard.
West realized he would have a hard time breathing soon, but oxygen masks did not drop down, he said.
So, flight attendants went around deploying them by hand.
Fortunately, not far from its departure airport, the plane made a sharp turn back toward it, Rathbone said. The actor is known for his role as Jasper Hale in the Twilight movie series and stars in the TV series Aim High. 
Tears as plane rattles
As it cruised back over land, the plane began to quake, and passengers broke into tears, afraid for their lives.
 Everyone was crying, passenger Dean Delbaugh said. I thought this was it. His wife, seated next to him, clung to him.
Rathbone was also flying with his family.
 I recited the Lord's Prayer as I held my son and my wife in my arms, he posted to social media site whosay.
Then flight attendants prepared the passengers in the event of a hard landing.
 The flight attendants were yelling brace, braceand they kept repeating it and repeating it on the top of their lungs, West said.
Happy to be alive
But the pilot brought the scare to an end by setting the plane, which FlightAware.com identified as an Airbus A320, gently onto the runway.
 He put it on the numbers. He did good, West said. He came by afterwards and said helloto everybody. All of us were hugging him and saying thank you.
Passenger Jonathan Hubbard was sitting in the exit row and wasted no time.
 I took the exit door and just threw it out the plane and just jumped out, he told KCAL. An inflatable chute was waiting to catch him.
JetBlue spokeswoman Jessica Felipe said everyone evacuated the plane by using emergency slides.
 I grabbed my son and jumped down the inflated ramp, my wife following, Rathbone tweeted. We left all our personal effects onboard. Who cares. We were alive. 
Passengers were led to a room, where they were debriefed, Rathbone said. KCAL reported that those wishing to continue to Austin were put onto a later flight.
There was no statement on the Flight 1416 incident on JetBlue's website. But on the day of the incident, the airline announced CEO Dave Barger would step down, effective in February. The statement did not connect the decision with the mishap.
In August, a JetBlue engine caught fire in San Juan, Puerto Rico, sending passengers and crew down the emergency slides.
Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.
CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

"Millie's sister Arlene had been battling breast cancer for five years. Then the doctor gave Arlene some bad news. The cancer had spread to her brain and there was no treatment that would cure her. ""I'll keep taking care of you,"" Millie told her sister. Millie and Arlene were both in their 50s, but Millie was 5 years older than Arlene. Arlene would always be Millie's little sister. Throughout Arlene's illness, Millie took care of things. Millie went with Arlene to all of her appointments. Millie went to all of Arlene's chemotherapy and radiation treatments. When Arlene lost her hair because of the chemo, Millie helped her pick a natural-looking wig. Arlene was appreciative, but also felt bad. Millie had a family of her own to take care of, and yet she spent most of her time taking care of Arlene.
 
Arlene told Millie she wanted to be put in a hospice. Millie did not know what that was. Arlene's doctor gave the sisters some brochures. The brochures explained that hospice care would try to make Arlene as comfortable as possible by providing pain management. They also focused on the emotional health of patients and their families by providing counseling. Millie was reluctant to place Arlene in hospice. Millie felt like she was abandoning her baby sister. Arlene insisted though.
""It's about time someone else wait on me hand and foot,"" Arlene joked. Millie went with Arlene to check into the hospice. Not only did the staff take care of Arlene, they also had activities for Millie, a member of the family. The staff told Millie that she could even spend the night here when she wanted. They asked Arlene what some of her favorite foods were so their chef could make what she liked. Arlene felt comfortable in the hospice.",B1
"The president she once pointed a gun at has been dead for nearly three years, and her longtime idol and leader, Charles Manson, remains in prison.
Lynnette Squeaky Fromme appears in court in Los Angeles, California, in December 1969.
However, Lynette Squeaky Fromme is about to get her first taste of real freedom in more than three decades.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Fromme, now 60, is set to be released on parole August 16.
Fromme is housed at Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas.
For years, she was one of Manson's few remaining followers, as many other Manson Family members have shunned him. A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson.
Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then-President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. Secret Service agents prevented her from firing, but the gun was later found to have no bullet in the chamber, although it contained a clip of ammunition.
In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled the president had his hands out and was waving... and he looked like cardboard to me. But at the same time, I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was. 
She said she knew Ford was in town and near her, and I said,I got ta go and talk to him,and then I thought, That's foolish. He's not going to stop and talk to you.People have already shown you can lay blood in front of them and they 're not, you know, they do n't think anything of it. I said, Maybe I 'll take the gun,and I thought,I have to do this. This is the time.
She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison. Asked whether she had any regrets, Fromme said, No. No, I do n't. I feel it was fate. However, she said she thought that her incarceration was unnecessary and that she could n't see herself repeating her offense.
 My argument to the jury was, if she wanted to kill him, she would have shot him, John Virga, a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme, told CNN on Tuesday. She 'd been around guns. And let's be realistic: We know the Manson family, at least some of them, are killers. 
Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons. Inmates do receive good time -- for every year and one day they serve, Ponce said, 54 days are lopped off their sentence.
Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said. According to reports, she for years waived her right to a parole hearing. The Bureau of Prisons would not say whether she changed her mind and requested a hearing, but the U.S. Parole Commission's Web site says that everyone who wishes to be considered for parole, except those committed under juvenile delinquency procedures, must complete a parole application.
Federal inmates serving life are generally paroled after 30 years, unless the parole commission decides to block the release, according to a commission spokesman. Inmates who are paroled remain under supervision until the commission decides to terminate the sentence.
Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said. She was not released then, however, because of extra time added to her sentence for a 1987 escape from the West Virginia prison, which occurred after her interview that same year. She was found two days later, only a few miles from the prison. At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
FMC-Carswell spokeswoman Maria Douglas would not comment on Fromme's behavior in prison in recent years.
Fromme reportedly joined Manson's family after meeting him in California in 1967. She was not involved in the murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, on August 9 and 10, 1969, that landed Manson and other followers in prison. However, she and other Manson followers maintained a vigil outside the courthouse during his trial.
In the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because he did n't kill anybody.... I would rather be in, because I know I laid a lot of my thinking in his mind. 
Virga said he told the jury that Fromme assaulted Ford, but did not attempt to assassinate him. If Fromme had killed the president, no one would have listened to her, he said. She did n't want people to think she was a kook. 
And she was n't, he said, recalling that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as a bright, intelligent young woman from a middle-class family. It's just hard to imagine how she got all caught up with Manson, he said.
Fromme wanted to be heard on issues including the environment, he said. She had certain causes that she wanted to talk about. But first and foremost in her mind was always Manson. 
Explaining herself after the attempt, according to the book Real Life at the White House, Fromme said, Well, you know, when people treat you like a child and pay no attention to the things you say, you have to do something. 
During her trial, Virga traveled to Washington to depose Ford, who testified on videotape about the incident.
In the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson a once-in-a-lifetime soul.... He's got more heart and spirit than anyone I 've ever met. She said she still corresponded with him. He's got everything he wants coming from me, 'cause he gave me everything. 
She said then she did n't plan to seek a parole hearing: The parole board does not hold my life in its hands. And I do n't want to be too critical, but men tend to think they do. Charlie never thought he did. He never expressed all this desire for power, this desire for acceptance. 
Ford died in 2006 at age 93. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Fromme's release.
Virga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975. I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble, he said. She needs to stay out of trouble. She's been in prison a long time... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson.

"It was not so long ago that women in the United States were treated like second-class citizens. They did not have the same basic rights as their male counterparts had. At one time, women were not allowed to vote, own property, or get education. Since those dark times, the women of America have made great strides in their struggle for equality. One of their heroes was the great Billie Jean King.
 
King was a professional tennis player, who gained great success during her career on the women's tennis court. She won 39 Grand Slam Titles, 12 singles, 16 women's doubles, and 11 mixed doubles. She found success in just about every venue she participated in, including the Federation Cup Championships. King's greatest accomplishment, however, was an exhibition match that took place in Houston, Texas on September 20, 1973.
The 29-year-old King, who was at the top of her professional career at the time, faced a former Wimbledon Champion, Bobby Riggs. Riggs was one of the best men's players during his prime in the late 1930s and 40s. The 55-year-old Riggs challenged King to an exhibition match claiming that the women's game was far inferior to the men's game. He said that even a 55-year-old, ""washed-up"" former player could beat the top woman in the world. The stage was set for the match. However, it was not much of a match at all.
King soundly defeated Riggs without much trouble. The match was later exposed for what many people claimed it would be: a showcase for King to demonstrate that women could compete against men. The victory was part of the equal rights movement that was sweeping the nation during that time. King became an outspoken advocate of equal rights for women.",B1
"When you apply for public housing, on the application you need to give the names and ages of everyone who will live with you. You will also need to give the address of where you currently live and a phone number which you can be contacted with.
 
In your application, you need to explain why you think you qualify for public housing help. Some reasons can include being a veteran, being poor, or living in bad conditions. Bad conditions can mean that the place you are living now is dangerous or it can mean that you are in a domestic violence situation. The government will also want to know the name and contact information of your current landlord and any landlords you had in the past. This is so that the government can find out if you are a good tenant. You will also need to tell the government how much money you make in a year and how you make that money. You can't just make that information up. You will need to provide your boss's information, old checks, and bank statements.
The government may visit you in your current home and interview you and people you live with. Other things the government will ask for are your birth certificate and the birth certificates of all people who will live with you and proof that you pay taxes, like a tax return. If you are eligible for any public housing assistance, you will get a letter. If you're approved, you'll be put on a waiting list. You may be on the waiting list for a long time before you actually can move into a public housing unit. This is because there are many people applying and eligible for help. Sometimes you can be waiting for years.",B1

You can sell your skills, your time or your used stuff to make some extra money.
With an abundance of job losses, salary cuts, eliminated bonuses and diminished 401 -LRB- K -RRB- matching contributions, your income is shrinking -- but the bills are n't.
If your regular job is n't earning you enough cash or you 've lost your job altogether, these simple side gigs can help put some padding in your pockets until -- maybe even after -- you get back on your feet.
Here are 10 ways real people are creatively taking home some extra dough:
1. Do freelance work
Felice Premeau Devine left her lucrative, full-time job two years ago to raise her son. In the interim, she's picked up writing and editing freelance work and started a blog, where she is able to earn a little cash from advertising.
Nowadays, almost any job can be done on a contract or freelance basis. Check out sites like Sologig, which lead job seekers to contract, consulting, freelance, temp-to-hire and part-time project opportunities in your field.
2. Sell your books
If you 're a college student or you hung on to your college textbooks thinking you might want to read them again somewhere down the line, select retailers like Barnes & Noble allow you to sell your textbooks for some quick cash. Or, take some classics from your personal library and sell them at a local second-hand bookstore.
3. Search circulating coinage
Susan Headley, the guide to coins on About.com, is a lifetime coin collector who has been boosting her income by searching through circulating coinage for the past six years. In 2008, she made about $2,500 and so far in 2009, she has earned approximately $500 from coins she's found.
People who search circulating coinage successfully for a side income do so in very large numbers, she says. They buy rolls of coins from banks, typically in whole boxes, and sort through it to find stuff that just does n't belong, Headley says. Half dollars, for example, were no longer made from 90 percent silver after 1965, but they still had 40 percent silver in them until 1970; either of these turn a nice profit. Presidential dollar errors can be worth $50 to $5,000 each; uncirculated state quarters can sell from $10 to $50 per roll; and rare error coins can value up to $35,000.
4. Start a business 
Turn your hobby, skills or expertise into a part-time business. Sites like Jobvana can help you do so by providing you with free tools to market your services and offer specialized skills to those looking for help.
Peter Olson says he built a profile in September 2008 offering to teach guitar lessons. He has since gained two students, earning about $240 extra dollars per month and grossing around $1,000 since he started teaching.
5. Enter local and online sweepstakes
Wendy Limauge has been entering sweepstakes since 1993 and teaching others to win through her Web site, Sweeties Sweeps, since 2002. Though winning sweepstakes rarely provides actual cash, her winnings have consistently provided her and her family with 200 to 300 prizes a year, many of them large items she and her husband could n't afford on their incomes alone.
Prizes she has won include three TVs, two of which are flat-screens; a home theatre system; three dishwashers, each won on separate occasions; at least $1,500 in grocery gift certificates; an $18,000 voucher for the vehicle of her choice; a trip to France valued at $25,000; and, in March 2009, she won $5,000 in an instant-win game.
 The Internet has so many options for saving money, getting something for free, winning a prize or earning money from home, Limauge says. You just need to find those resources that offer helpful information and point you in the right direction to get you started and keep you motivated. 
6. Give your opinion -- and get paid
Linda Childers, a California-based freelance writer, says many of her friends participate in focus groups. Contributing an hour of your time can earn you up to $100, sometimes more. Online surveys, phone surveys and product trials can also earn you anywhere from $5 to $150. Check out Free Paid Surveys or FindFocusGroups.
7. Sell your junk
Terri Jay earns $2,000 - $3,000 per month just by selling junk. On eBay, Jay not only sells stuff she is n't using; she hits up local thrift stores on 99-cent days, garage sales and tack sales, looking for things of which she knows the value. She says her best sale was for a drink tray from the 70s: She paid 25 cents for it and it sold for $87.
 The trick is to -LSB- sell -RSB- what you know, she advises. Therefore you can list them -LSB- at correct prices -RSB- so they will get picked up in searches -LSB- on eBay -RSB-. 
8. Join a direct selling company
Direct selling is one of the easiest ways to earn some extra cash, especially if you sell products you love. Avon, for example, allows you start your own business for $10 -- your take home depends on your efforts. Some full-time representatives earn six-figure salaries, others own licensed Avon Beauty Centers and many just sell Avon part time around their family's schedules.
Haizel MacIntyre started her Avon business in June of 2008 to earn supplemental income to her full-time job when her husband was laid off. Since joining Avon, MacIntyre averages $1,800 a month in sales and her husband is helping her run the business. Her Avon earnings help pay the bills, provide extras for her three kids and she is hoping to earn enough to put towards her college tuition when she goes back to school to get her Masters in Social Work.
9. Be a secret shopper
Keen eyes for detail as well as a good memory are really all that it takes to succeed as a secret shopper, says Zippy Sandler, who has been mystery shopping for about 13 years. After registering with a secret shopping company, you are paid to basically go undercover and report on a company's operation from the customer point of view.
Sandler decided to start secret shopping not only to earn money eating, traveling and shopping, but also to learn customer service skills to pass along to the employees she managed at a retail store. Depending on the clients she is shopping for, Sandler says she has earned everywhere from $100 to $2,000 per month.
10. Sell your photos to stock agencies
It does n't matter if you 're a hobbyist, an amateur or a seasoned photographer - anyone can submit their photos to stock photo agencies like Shutterstock.com. If your images are accepted, they will be available for download by subscribers. Each time someone downloads your photos, you get 25 cents.

"Authorities scoured the national park around Washington's Mount Rainier on Sunday for a man they say fatally shot a park ranger and fled into the woods, a park spokeswoman said.
The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said.
Four to five feet of snow is on the ground, including about two feet of fresh powder, where the gunman escaped.
 There's a lot of snow on the ground, -LRB- and -RRB- it would be difficult to move through quickly, Taylor told CNN. And it's heavily forested. 
The bloodshed began with what the spokesman called a normal traffic stop around 10:30 a.m. PT -LRB- 1:30 p.m. ET -RRB-. But the suspect did n't heed a request to pull over, prompting a ranger to radio ahead requesting assistance.
Park ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, responded to that call and set up her patrol vehicle as a roadblock.
 When he -LRB- the shooter -RRB- arrived at that spot, he got out -LRB- of his car -RRB- and fatally shot her, said Taylor.
The suspect then ran into the spacious national park, whose border is about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The park -- the centerpiece being the 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, which is considered an active volcano -- comprises 235,625 acres in the Cascade Range.
Entrances to the park were closed after the shooting. Taylor said that authorities were able to evacuate most of the people... safely, with more than 100 people holed up in our primary visitor center with food, water and five law enforcement officers standing guard.
 We do n't want to try to have those people get to their vehicle and caravan down the park road where it could be dangerous, being sniped at by a gunman, the spokeswoman said Sunday night. So for now, they are going to sit tight in the visitor center. 
Anderson was the mother of a 4-year-old and 1-year-old and the wife of a fellow park ranger, according to Taylor.
A ranger at Mount Rainier for the past four years, Anderson was on the job not for money or for glory, but out of a love for wild places and the national parks, said Taylor.
She is survived by her husband, who is also a park ranger, as well as a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old.
 She was a person with a quick smile, a very gentle person, a very competent ranger, said Taylor. This gunman took the life of somebody who had a great deal to live for and was making great contributions to society by being a national park ranger.

"Nowadays many people are social media fanatics. They are always looking at their mobile phones or tablets, and updating their Twitter or Facebook accounts. They are taking pictures of what they eat, or taking pictures of themselves, which is called ""selfies"". When people are not oversharing, they are constantly reading or looking at what friends and family members are posting. Social media is becoming addicting.
 
Research shows that most people spend on average almost 4 hours a day on social networking sites. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media for work or to stay in touch with friends, other people find that using social media so much causes anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way to procrastinate. So just as many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time, many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.
Ironically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved ones were far away, they would call them on the telephone instead. Some even wrote handwritten postcards or letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits like journaling or meditating.",B1
"His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton. Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.
Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25, 1979, the Friday before Memorial Day. He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York.
It was the first time he 'd walked to the bus stop by himself. It was just a few blocks away. Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented.
His mother, Julie Patz, learned that Etan had n't been in classes when he failed to return home. She called the school at 3:30 p.m., then called the homes of all his friends. When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report.
By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found. Watch an update on the case 
The boy's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children's movement, which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
 In our minds there were only two possibilities, said Stan Patz, the boy's father. Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own, and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe. 
Patz lived with this hope until 1982, when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramosarrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's.
Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City, a neighborhood not far from Soho. In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case.
When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home, they found he had many photographs of small blond boys. They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive. 
Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance. But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy, GraBois said.
Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.
Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him, according to published reports. He left town and disappeared for six years -- until GraBois reviewed Etan's case. GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.
GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison.
GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question: How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz ? 
Ramos told GraBois that he 'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing. He was 90 percent sure it was the same he 'd seen in the news that was missing, GraBois said.
According to GraBois, Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights.
 Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said. When questioned further, Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer, according to GraBois.
Ramos is serving a 10 - to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said.
GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates. He would n't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them, but said he's convinced he's eyeing the right suspect.
GraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, but prosecutors have not brought charges. They say that without a body, they do n't have enough evidence.
Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.

"Green isn't the first word that pops into most people's head when they think of New York City. Yet, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historical Landmark, takes up 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people go to escape the noise and crowds of urban life. Before it opened in 1857, it wasn't an empty space. People lived on that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish, and Italian immigrants. They were forced off the land to construct the park.
 
One section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a grassy area where people can lie in the sun, but actual sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934. The sheep from there were eventually moved to another park in the city. Many events take place in Central Park, especially in the warm spring and summer months. There is an outdoor theater, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The plays are free, which causes such high demand that people line up for hours before performances to get inside. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in the park in the spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park, and a number of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents out small mechanical sailboats. There is also a puppet theater and a carousel for kids.
The park is not dead in the winter. When it snows, families often go to sled or to go ice-skating in an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump.",B1
"The American leg of Miley Cyrustour is now officially over, thanks to an extreme allergic reaction to an antibiotic.
Her representative released a statement Friday indicating that all remaining U.S. dates on the Miley Cyrus Bangerztour have been postponed. That means that shows scheduled next week for Philadelphia, at Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, and on Long Island, New York are officially off -- at least for now.
The announcement is n't entirely unexpected: Her representative said Thursday that the entertainer could need a lot more time to recover from the ailment that landed her in a Kansas City hospital last week.
 Sick of waking up to needles, the 21-year-old Cyrus tweeted Friday. #goingthruit. 
The singer canceled a show in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week because of what was reported to be a flu-like illness. But the severity of her condition was n't fully known until this week, when she canceled performances in Kansas City and St. Louis.
In a statement, her camp explained that Cyrus got a sinus infection while in North Carolina, then was prescribed the antibiotic Cephalexin, which she has now suffered an extreme allergic reaction to. 
 This type of extreme reaction can last from five to 27 days in these types of cases, the statement said.
 She will remain hospitalized and is under a doctor's care until we see some improvement in her condition and is asking for your compassion and privacy at this time. Miley is devastated about missing shows and possibly disappointing her fans. 
But it appears Cyrus wo n't be off the stage for long.
Her representative said Friday the European leg of the tour will proceed as planned, starting with a May 2 date in Amsterdam.
This summer, she should be back partying in the USA, as she intoned in one of her best-known hits.
A slew of new shows, running between August 1 and August 14, were announced Friday to replace recently canceled ones. Those dates include two additional shows in Pittsburgh and Chicago.

"The self-portrait is nothing new. Painters and photographers have always used themselves as subjects. Today, however, almost everyone walks around with a camera in his or her pocket. This is because most cell phones have cameras on them. The fact that most people have cell phone cameras with them all the time has led to the rise of the selfie. A selfie is a self-portrait usually taken with a cell phone.
 
Since the pictures are usually taken on a cell phone, many people tend to share these photographs with friends and even strangers on different social networking websites. Some of the popular social networking platforms people use to share selfies include Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook.
People usually take selfies when they are engaged in normal day-to-day activities. They take selfies of their commutes to work or school. People take selfies of themselves eating. Other people take selfies to show what they are wearing or whom they are hanging out with.
The most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm's length. Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these pictures, you can usually see the phone the person is taking a picture with. Selfies taken using a mirror often are taken in a bathroom, which some people think is offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.
Some people think that selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or superficial. It is not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they usually are trying to present themselves in the best light. However, some people use selfies to show what they really look like. Some people are trying to challenge stereotypes of what makes someone attractive.",B1
"Cameron Russell aims to open up the media landscape to divergent voices a little bit at a time. In March, she helped launch Interrupt magazine, initially a webzine, so these other perspectives can join in the media conversation. Its first issue is devoted to body image.
Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media. She has been a model for brands such as Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Benetton and has appeared in the pages of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W.
She is also known for her TEDx talk, Looks Are n't Everything, about those who win the genetic lottery and how society rewards the conventionally beautiful.
To celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called You Are a Genius on New York's Lower East Side through Monday. It's at 215 Bowery St.
CNN spoke recently with Russell about her new project.
CNN: How did the idea come about ?
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while. After the amazing response to my TEDx talk, my Brooklyn-based art lab decided it was time to make this a reality. At the Big Bad Lab, we build participatory art and media platforms for causes, communities and organizations we care about. I run the magazine with Hannah Assebe and Allison Bland as well as hundreds of collaborators who provide writing, photos, editing help and moral support.
CNN: Why Interrupt ?
Russell: Statistics show that diversity in the media is pretty dismal. Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations. Ever watch a panel about immigration without any immigrants ? Abortion without any women ? Marriage rights without any LGBTQ people ? We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase. Sometimes you just need to interrupt !
CNN: What are highlights in the first issue ?
Russell: It's all about body image. We found out that about 50 % of 8-year-old girls do n't like their bodies. But it's not just girls. Many women said they could n't remember a time when they liked their bodies -- they could n't remember what that felt like.
We collaborated with Interrupt photographer Marie C. who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies. Their answers illuminated a perspective that was missing from mass-media conversations. These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well ! Instead of the usual negative views -- I 'm too fat or I do n't like my nose -- these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs. It's refreshing. Their story was a huge success and got over 5,000 shares.
Then there's Teagan Widmer, a transgender woman who wrote about trying to find the right bra. Her story is not exactly something the mainstream press would cover. But when we posted her advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories.
The lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we do n't just have a media that lack diversity, we actually underestimate our audiences. There are n't just a few types of experiences that matter -- there are countless.
CNN: With so many publications going digital only, what made you decide to put out a magazine ?
Russell: Our first print issue is a mock tabloid. Starting this week, it is appearing for free in nail salons, newsstands, dentist offices and other not-so-hidden places around NYC. Improving access to media means not just focusing on early adopters. We are spending our resources on building a community of collaborators who can share unique and critical views.
CNN: What's been the most interesting experience in launching Interrupt ?
Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab. We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity. We have two selfie walls because taking a selfie is an innate and obvious way that draws in a lot of young people. We have a You Are a Geniusbar, where people can explore online resources for social services, civic engagement, health and well-being, and creative production.
Having a physical offline space where children, teenagers and random passers-by can come in and get involved is amazing. Check them out on our Tumblr feed. Many of these people spent over an hour here, took pictures, wrote pieces for the next issue and hung out. Sometimes, great collaboration is hard to nurture online so doing so offline is the way to go. We hope to run another one this fall. Stay tuned.
CNN: How do you get the word out ?
Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter. Now that we 're deeper into the project, we 've cultivated many more collaborations. For example, -LRB- check out -RRB- a cool piece we did with teens at South End Technology Center in Boston. We 've found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the Genius Lab.
CNN: What's the biggest difference between your webzine and say Buzzfeed ?
Russell: There are a ton of new media startups heavily focused on getting huge traffic and high growth, but that's not our central goal. We want to build something that disrupts the way we think media can be made.
Can Interrupt make an impact ?
Russell: Every time someone who is n't a media maker creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit.
CNN: What did you want to be when you grow up ?
Russell: I always wanted to become president ! When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics. The first long book I remember reading was -LRB- Richard -RRB- Neustadt's Presidential Power in fourth grade. But as I learned more about our democracy, I realized that who participates, who votes and who gets elected is not as simple as it seems. That got me interested in how to bring people together and ignite alternative networks of power, and that's why I started the Big Bad Lab.
CNN: Who are your heroes ?
Russell: I 'm inspired by the people I work with. At the Genius Lab, we have three incredible artists. Ernest English makes enormous participatory public art pieces. Adalky Capellan is a young woman who creates very large-scale work. When I saw her photos, I knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background. And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163. She is a joy to work with, and her piece is all about love, which is great for us since one of our upcoming issues is about LGBT.
CNN: If you can give one piece of advice to young women, what would it be ?
Russell: When boys at school told me I could n't play their game, my mom told me to ask: Why, do you need a penis to play ?

"Taxes are special fees charged by a government on the people who live in a country, state or city. These fees help pay for public services like police, road and bridge repair, and public schools. In the United States people have to pay national, state, and local taxes. Income tax is a tax applied to how much money a person earns in a year. There are both federal and state income taxes. These have to be paid every year by April 15th. There are special forms the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the government agency in charge of collecting taxes, asks people to fill out. There are tax credits that people with low income, college students, and parents can get. These credits could mean actually getting money back from the government. This money is called a tax refund. People can get both a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who works has to be taxed regardless of the immigration status. Not paying income taxes could mean a fine or even jail time.
 
Payroll taxes are taxes that are taken right out of a person's paycheck. There are federal and state payroll taxes. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social Security taxes pay for the retirement and disability benefits received by millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance program that covers the elderly and the disabled.
People who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific extra percentage charged on nearly all purchases. Everything from soap to furniture has a sales tax attached when bought. The amount of the sales tax is different across states and cities.",B1
"On December 26, 2004, a 10-minute long earthquake with a 9.3 magnitude occurred in the Indian Ocean. This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a dozen countries' shores. Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have emerged. One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named Wati.
 
The tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old. Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being washed into an unknown town. After many years of searching for her, her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!
According to Wati, she had been ""adopted"" by a stranger who found her on the streets after the tsunami. Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough money. The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.
Finally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. ""When I saw my mother, I knew it was her,"" said the 15-year-old. ""I just knew."" The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster.",B1
"Ten everyday people will be recognized Thursday for their remarkable efforts to make the world a better place.
CNN's Anderson Cooper will reveal this year's top 10 CNN Heroes during the 8 a.m. hour of New Day. 
All the top 10 Heroes were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN. Each will receive $50,000 and be honored at CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a globally broadcast event that airs December 1.
One of the top 10 will receive an additional $250,000 for their cause if the public chooses them as the CNN Hero of the Year.
Starting Thursday morning, you will be able to vote for your favorite Hero at CNNHeroes.com or from your mobile device. Voting ends November 17.
Last year's Hero of the Year was Pushpa Basnet, a Nepalese woman who supports children so they do n't have to live behind bars with their incarcerated parents.
She started a home in Kathmandu where children can receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life.
 These children have done nothing wrong. They are simply caught in something they do not understand, Basnet said. We want to work with the government to bring them all out of prison. And they deserve a better future. 
Robin Lim, the Hero of the Year in 2011, was recognized for helping thousands of poor Indonesians have a healthy pregnancy and birth.
 I found that if you have a good idea and you do it with love, a lot of people want to help you, Lim said.
This is the seventh year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com.
This year's tribute show will be held in New York and hosted by Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History.

"Susan grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska, the heartland of the USA. She remembers playing in the corn fields as a child, and seeing miles and miles of land stretching out as far as she could see. One day her aunt took her to see the 1997 movie Titanic starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. She marveled at the sight of the vast ocean. It was something she had never seen before. She remembers turning to her aunt to say, ""I'm going on a ship like that one day, auntie.""
 
True to her words, Susan left Nebraska, and moved to Los Angeles, California. She wanted to live near the ocean, and was delighted to discover the Queen Mary was permanently docked in Long Beach. The grand ship, which has the same size of the Titanic, is now a museum and tourist attraction. She didn't hesitate to book a tour of the ship. ""This is wonderful,"" she thought to herself.
Upon arriving on board, Susan was not disappointed. It was everything she hoped it would be. The ship was restored to its original state, which was very luxurious. The tour she took highlighted the ship's history and importance over the years. She ate at one of the three restaurants, and stayed the night in the ship's hotel. The Queen Mary was built in the 1930s in Great Britain, and enjoyed many years sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. It was host to many dignitaries such as Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and many Hollywood celebrities. During World War II, the ship was assigned as a troop transport where it was used to transport up to 18,000 Allied soldiers per trip.
After the war, it was restored to its original state, and began its transatlantic travels. In 1967, the city of Long Beach purchased the aging ocean liner, and it has been a popular attraction for the city ever since. ""It is living history,"" said Susan, after her visit.

"Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair.
Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
 I always start with color when I 'm designing things. Always. If the color is right, I feel better, he touts on his Web site.
But Mizrahi has an explanation for his less than colorful attire on a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta.
 We have this very quick trip, and we have to go right back and there's no time to pack and we ca n't check luggage... so I focused it to black, gray and white. 
It's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book How to Have Style -LRB- Gotham -RRB-. Despite the slightly audacious title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress.
For five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target. But with his new book comes a new job -- as the creative director of Liz Claiborne.
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK. The following is an edited version of that interview:
CNN: You started in acting at the High School of the Performing Arts. How do you combine that love and your love for design ?
Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater. I think that fashion is a form of entertainment. And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.
Like women say, Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I 've worn it before. I love it. It seems to fulfill who I am really easily. Whatever it is, she knows that it just makes her life really easy so she associates with it, you know ? And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that. Watch Mizrahi talk about his new book 
But more than that, I have designs -LSB- in -RSB- the entertainment business. There's a movie called Unzipped about me that was a really successful movie. I had two TV series. I design costumes constantly for theater and ballet and opera. So to me it's all one big world. It's seamless to me.
CNN: What's your daily schedule like ? It has to be crazy with all that you do.
Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that. There's a base to it. I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day. But when I get to work is when it changes up.
Some days I work in the showroom; some days I work in the design room; some days I actually work in my own private studio, where I just do sketches and sketches and sketches. Other days I work in the TV studio taping segments and my Web show.
I do n't really love travel. I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean ? When I finally let myself enjoy it, I can enjoy traveling. But it takes a great agony for me to separate from New York City and my studios and the people that I work with.
CNN: Say you 're walking down the street. What's the most common style error that you see in people ?
Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair. I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.
You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they 're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair. Because you know what ? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.
But I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair. It's like you should spend your most money... on your hair. You 'd think I had a chain of hair salons, but I do n't. -LSB- Laughter -RSB-.
CNN: What about in home furnishing ? You do a line for Target that's ending this year. What's the most common mistake people make there ?
Mizrahi: You know what it is with people ? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home -- they leave things around. I like to think about cabinets. I like to put things away as much as possible. It's like salt shakers on the table ? No. You put the salt shakers in a cabinet, and the table looks so much better when it's plain. You know what I mean ?
And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that. I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers. You either have gorgeous, gorgeous flowers, or you have no flowers. Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table. That's awful, but it's true.
CNN: How has your personal style evolved over time ?
Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style. I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I do n't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork. And every once in a while I break out and do something crazy.
CNN: Can you describe your personality for me, and how it affects your style ?
Mizrahi: I do n't know. It's very hard to describe one's personality. I ca n't say about my personality, but I like to think that I 'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.
It's kind of like here's the 360 degrees of what's going on -LSB- in -RSB- the world culturally, you know ? Socioeconomically, culturally, and here's my response to it. Here's what the clothes look like; here's what you should be wearing. And it's kind of like a wonderful edge, you 're standing, and yet there's room enough in there for your own interpretation or to move in one direction or another.
Oh ! Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic. I am very claustrophobic. I do n't like to commit to one thing necessarily, but when I do commit to it, it's whole and complete.

"Julie was sitting in bed late at night playing with her brand-new smartphone. Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter Mary. Julie had been widowed for five years now. Since she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.
 
Up until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people were doing. However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would want to talk to her. To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20-something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.
The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. She could not believe her eyes. Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her. Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, ""I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!"" Mary was confused and asked, ""Why?"" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic.",B1
"A school bus transporting Maxwell High School students overturned on the corner of Seally Street and Wilten Avenue. The driver of the bus was trying to avoid hitting a car that passed a red light, and the bus overturned with 37 students inside. The driver suffered minor injuries to the face, and two students broke their arms.
 
Roger Peterson, Principal of Maxwell High School, said that the driver was not at fault. His reaction helped prevent any serious injuries. As soon as the bus overturned, the driver opened the door using the emergency handle and started evacuating the students one by one. He notified the police of the students that were injured.
""We teach our drivers to ensure the safety of the students first,"" Peterson said. The driver, whose name is not being released at the moment due to an investigation, along with the two students are being treated at Belmont Hospital. The parents were notified as soon as possible by school officials.
According to John Pineda, who witnessed the accident, the school bus almost hit the car. ""The bus wasn't going that fast, but the other car was. If the bus had hit the car, those people inside would surely have been seriously injured, or worse,"" Pineda said. Pineda also said that the driver of the school bus took precaution to turn where people weren't walking. If he were to have made a right, rather than a left, he would have definitely hit people that were crossing the street.
Peterson issued a statement saying that the students who were inside the bus could miss school the next day to make sure they were okay, and relax with their family. According to Peterson, the police provided him with a list of students that were involved in the accident. Police are looking for the driver of the car that passed the red light. It was a white Honda Civic.",B1
"When Christopher Lee was a young man, he had a dream to become an English professor. He worked hard at this by first going to a community college after high school before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, Chris earned his bachelor's degree in English, but he still needed his Master's degree to teach at college. Chris met George while taking a class at his old community college. George was a news reporter, who told Chris how much he enjoyed his job. Chris became very interested in his story.
 
It turned out George was also an English major, but he turned to journalism because he wanted to be published. George said to Chris one day, ""Chris, I've known lots of English majors who want to be published, but never got that chance. In journalism, you can get published, and get published often."" Chris thought about his words and asked him how he became a journalist. George laughed and said, ""Start with Journalism 101.""
Chris took his advice, and soon he fell in love with writing in journalism style. Its short, precise method of writing appealed to Chris. Journalists deal only in facts. It is not like English writing. You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. There is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is unlike English.
Soon, Chris earned his certificate, and went on to earn his Master's degree in journalism. He now works for a large, daily newspaper. He is very grateful to his old friend George, who introduced him to journalism. He has now been published more than 200 times. George changed the course of Christopher's life.",B1
" 
Donald had a rough morning. He had an argument with his wife, so he thought it would be a good idea to finish a six-pack of beer and a handful of prescription pain pills. This would have been fine if he had stayed inside his house. Instead, drunk and high, Donald began to harass his next-door neighbor. First he banged on his neighbor's door. Then he broke the glass panel of a porch light. Finally he ripped the light's wires out of the wall. That was the last straw. The neighbor called the police. The police came and arrested Donald for public intoxication and disturbing the peace. Donald was taken to a nearby jail. His stay only lasted a few hours. As soon as he was more sober, the police released him. Apparently, Donald wasn't quite sober enough though.
 
When he was released, Donald realized he was pretty far from his home. He didn't feel like walking almost two miles, so he called his friend from the jail to come get him. But Donald was getting impatient. When a woman got out of her car in the parking lot, he tried to get in. The woman screamed for help. Donald screamed, ""But this is my car!"" The woman kept screaming and Donald got out. He then thought it would be a good idea to take the bus home. A deputy was watching and arrested Donald again, after he had only been free for one hour. This time, however, Donald's jail stay would not be as short. He was charged with attempted burglary. A judge set his bail at $10,000. He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial.",B1
"Today's grandparents are joining their grandchildren on social media, but the different generations' online habits couldn't be more different. In the UK the over-55s are joining Facebook in increasing numbers, meaning that they will soon be the site's second biggest user group, with 3.5 million users aged 55-64 and 2.9 million over-65s.
Sheila, aged 59, says, 'I joined to see what my grandchildren are doing, as my daughter posts videos and photos of them. It's a much better way to see what they're doing than waiting for letters and photos in the post. That's how we did it when I was a child, but I think I'm lucky I get to see so much more of their lives than my grandparents did.'
Ironically, Sheila's grandchildren are less likely to use Facebook themselves. Children under 17 in the UK are leaving the site - only 2.2 million users are under 17 - but they're not going far from their smartphones. Chloe, aged 15, even sleeps with her phone. 'It's my alarm clock so I have to,' she says. 'I look at it before I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up.'
Unlike her grandmother's generation, Chloe's age group is spending so much time on their phones at home that they are missing out on spending time with their friends in real life. Sheila, on the other hand, has made contact with old friends from school she hasn't heard from in forty years. 'We use Facebook to arrange to meet all over the country,' she says. 'It's changed my social life completely.'
Teenagers might have their parents to thank for their smartphone and social media addiction as their parents were the early adopters of the smartphone. Peter, 38 and father of two teenagers, reports that he used to be on his phone or laptop constantly. 'I was always connected and I felt like I was always working,' he says. 'How could I tell my kids to get off their phones if I was always in front of a screen myself?' So, in the evenings and at weekends, he takes his SIM card out of his smartphone and puts it into an old-style mobile phone that can only make calls and send text messages. 'I'm not completely cut off from the world in case of emergencies, but the important thing is I'm setting a better example to my kids and spending more quality time with them.'
Is it only a matter of time until the generation above and below Peter catches up with the new trend for a less digital life?",B1
"Ever since Mary moved to the United States one year ago, she often heard the phrase ""no such thing as free lunch"". While she understood this to mean that you can't get something for nothing, she heard other mothers at her child's school talking about the free lunch program.
 
""How much does it cost to enroll?"" Mary asked the secretary at her child's school. The secretary smiled and told Mary that it didn't cost anything except a little bit of time. In order to find out if Mary's child was qualified to get free lunch at school, she had to fill out a form. The form was available in many languages besides English. It asked Mary basic questions like where she lived, how many children she had, and what her annual income was.
Filling out the form was easy, and Mary didn't have to include proof of her income. She was worried though if the information on the form would be shared with other agencies. The secretary told her that the information was not shared. If Mary made below a certain amount annually, her child could get free lunch not just during the school year, but also even during the summer, when there was no school.
Mary knew this would help her family. While Mary did work, she only worked part-time. Giving her child money for lunch every day did add up and impact the family budget.
After filling out and submitting the form back to the school secretary, Mary had to wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. A few weeks after she submitted the form, a letter arrived in the mail. The letter informed her that her child was qualified. The letter also told her that her child could also get free breakfast in school.",B1
"An 85-year-old woman in Tennessee named Astrid became a multimillionaire overnight after winning a $500 million lottery jackpot. However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.
 
Astrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!
On the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.
Astrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.
Within the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, ""I found it!"" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. ""Oh, thank you, daughter!"" Astrid cried. ""I owe you so much!"" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room.",B1
"A female graduate student at Virginia Tech was killed Wednesday night when a man she knew attacked her with a knife and decapitated her, a school spokesman said.
Virginia Tech police Chief Wendell Flinchum talks about the first slaying on campus since the 2007 shootings.
Virginia Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said Thursday that Xin Yang's killing was the first on the campus since April 16, 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people before turning a gun on himself.
Yang, 22, from Beijing, China, was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the Graduate Life Center at around 7 p.m., school spokesman Larry Hincker said in a written statement.
Campus police took Haiyang Zhu, 25, into custody at the scene. The Ningbo, China, native has been charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bail at a local jail, Hincker said.
Zhu did not say anything to the arresting officers, said campus police Chief Wendell Flinchum.
 There was blood on him, Flinchum said. The young woman and the suspect were not seen arguing, or anything of that nature, he added, citing witness statements.
Authorities said the two students knew each other. Based on emergency contact records maintained by the university, it is known that Zhu and Yang knew each other, Hincker said. No other details were provided.
The young woman arrived at the university two weeks ago to begin studies in accounting, he said in the statement.
Zhu is a graduate student pursuing a doctorate in agricultural and applied economics. He began studies at Virginia Tech in fall 2008, Hincker said.
 Our hearts go out to the victim and her family, President Charles W. Steger said in a letter to the campus community.
 An act of violence like this one brings back memories of the April 16 tragedy and I have no doubt that many of us feel especially distraught. 
Authorities say on April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and professors before killing himself.

"Event planning team
online
Alright, so I've divided up the tasks among the three of us planning this event like this:
@Jen: make guest list, schedule social media announcements, arrange room set-up, organise musicians
@Ed: book catering, send out invitations, design posters, book speakers
@Mike: reserve rooms, design invitations, write and publish blog post, get emcee
But please don't feel like we need to stick to this. If you prefer to do something else, feel free to say so.
Mike, 14:41
Yeah, I was thinking, as you are project leader @Mike, maybe it's best you make the guest list? I've got experience in graphic design so I'm happy to design the invitations.
Jen, 14:50
@Jen, do you mind designing the posters too? I'm not very good at designing.
Ed, 14:55
Sure, it'll be fun. If I take the poster design off you @Ed, do you think you can organise the musicians?
Jen, 14:56
Absolutely, I know some really good musicians that do events like this one. And I also know a really good emcee. Do you want me to take over getting the emcee too?
Ed, 14:58
@Ed I actually already have an emcee in mind so I think I'll handle that. I'd appreciate it if you could write and publish the blogpost about the event though.
Mike, 15:01
That's not a problem. I quite enjoy online marketing tasks.

If that's the case, @Ed do you want to schedule the social media announcements too?
Jen, 15:03
I can do that ... if someone books the speakers.
Ed, 15:04
I'll book the speakers. And since I'm making the guest list, I should send out the invitations too. @Jen, are you still okay with arranging the room set-up?
Mike, 15:08
Yes, let me do the room reservations as well.

"Rory McIlroy is off to a good start at the Scottish Open. He's hoping for a good finish, too, after missing the cut at the Irish Open.
McIlroy shot a course record 7-under-par 64 at Royal Aberdeen on Thursday, and he was actually the second player to better the old mark -- Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg had earlier fired a 65.
McIlroy carded eight birdies and one bogey in windy, chilly conditions.
 Going out this morning in these conditions I thought anything in the 60s would be a good score, so to shoot something better than that is pleasing, McIlroy was quoted as saying by the European Tour's website.
A win Sunday would be the perfect way for former No. 1 McIlroy to prepare for the British Open, which starts next week at Royal Liverpool. He won the last of his two majors in 2012.
 Everything was pretty much on, McIlroy said. I controlled my ball flight really well, which is the key to me playing well in these conditions and on these courses.
 I 've been working the last 10 days on keeping the ball down, hitting easy shots and taking spin off it, and I went out there today and really trusted what I practiced. 
Last year Phil Mickelson used the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart as the springboard to his British Open title and his 68 leaves him well within touching distance of McIlroy.
Mickelson needs a jolt of confidence given that Leftyhas slipped outside the top 10 in the rankings and has n't finished in the top 10 on the PGA Tour this season.
 I thought it was tough conditions, Mickelson said in an audio interview posted on the European Tour's website. I was surprised to see some low scores out there because it did n't seem like it was playing easy, and the wind was pretty strong.
 I felt like I played well and had a good putting day. It was a good day. 
Last year's U.S. Open champion, Justin Rose, was tied for 13th with a 69 but Jonas Blixt -- who tied for second at the Masters -- was well adrift following a 74.

"One of the most important lessons you should learn is when you drink, you shouldn't drive. I learned this the hard way. Last year, I got a DUI, which means Driving Under the Influence. If you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol, the police will ask you to take a breathalyzer test. When you do the test, you have to blow really hard into a machine, which will then tell you if you are over the limit to drive a vehicle. The limit is usually .08 blood alcohol volume. So, if you pass that, you are going to jail.
 
Even though you won't go to jail for a long time, you will be suffering the consequences of your mistake for a long time. Here is a list of the things you will have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. If you don't want to pay, you will have to do community service. I got my DUI almost two year ago, and I am still suffering the consequences. I still have 56 hours for community service.
I have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. You waste a lot of time and money. It gets difficult to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. It's not worth it. If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. It may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive.",B1
"No. 1 Florida State re-emerged in the second half and rallied to defeat No. 2 Auburn 34-31 in the BCS National Championship college football game on Monday in Pasadena, California.
The Seminoles -LRB- 13-0 -RRB- outscored the Tigers -LRB- 12-2 -RRB- 24-10 after halftime to win their third national title. It was FSU's second BCS crown and third national title.
Heisman Trophy winner and FSU quarterback Jameis Winston was 20-for-35 for 237 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner to Kelvin Benjamin with 13 seconds remaining.
More great photos from the championship game
The fourth quarter turned into a back-and-forth affair. The final 24 points of the game were scored in the last 4:42 of the game.
The Tigers appeared to be on the verge of their second title in four seasons when Tre Mason scored a go-ahead touchdown on a determined 37-yard scamper with 1:19 left in the game.
But led by Winston, the Seminoles drove 80 yards in seven plays to grab the crown.
Who will win next year's championship ?
FSU's rally included Levonte Whitfield's 100-yard kickoff return with 4:31 left to put Florida State ahead. The extra point made it 27-24.
Tigers take halftime lead
After an early FSU field goal, Auburn scored three straight touchdowns to take a 21-3 lead.
But Florida State's Devonta Freeman scored on a 3-yard run with 1:28 left in the first half to cut the deficit at intermission to 11. That FSU drive was kept alive by a fourth-down end-around out of punt formation.
The only score in the third quarter was a 41-yard field goal by FSU kicker Roberto Aguayo. He also made a 35-yarder in the first period.
FSU also got a fourth-quarter TD from Chad Abram on a 11-yard reception with 10:55 remaining.
Final BCS game: Thanks for the memories
Auburn kicker Cody Parkey's 22-yard field goal with 4:42 left made the score 24-20.
Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall threw for two touchdowns and ran for one. He was 14-for-27 for 216 yards and one interception. Mason ran for 195 yards on 34 carries.
The game was the final championship contest under the current system, which featured the top two teams in the Bowl Championship Series poll. Next season, the top four teams will meet in a playoff where it will take two victories to win the title.

"Public schools are available for kids from kindergarten through 12th grade free of charge. However, many families choose to pay for their children's primary and secondary education by sending them to private schools. There are many different types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their kids there. Some private schools are military type and yet others are boarding schools where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain religion. These schools teach a specific faith's beliefs and traditions as well as the regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jewish people, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools that specialize in teaching disabled students.
 
Some parents choose private schools because they feel that they offer a better education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a different type of curriculum. Waldorf Schools, for example, only let children play and use items made of natural materials.
Private schools are also called independent schools or non-state schools because they are not run by local, state, or national governments. They can pick what students to go to their schools. They do this through admission examinations and interviews. There is often an admissions application. Some private schools accept anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not get any money collected from local, state, and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited number of scholarships to help pay for school. Many of these scholarships are need-based, meaning for students who can't afford the tuition. Other scholarships are offered for students with very good grades or for students that have a talent in a sport or art.",B1
"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident.
 One of the officers told me to stop, but it was because I -LRB- said -RRB- to them that what they did it was an abuse and I witnessed everything, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 (U+02DA). 
Santana told Cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work.
In other interviews, Santana has said he feared for his life, which almost kept him from revealing the recording.
Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. That evidence led to the officer's firing and arrest on a murder charge.
Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He could hear the sound of a Taser in use.
At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He believes Scott was trying to get away.
 Mr. Scott never tried to fight, Santana told CNN.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser.
After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer went back to pick up something.
Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he was n't 100 % sure what it was.
Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording.
What we know about Officer Slager
The cell phone video, which Santana revealed this week, reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black.
Police said Slager pulled the 50-year-old Scott over for a nonworking brake light on Saturday morning. Scott, according to a dash cam video, fled from Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot.
When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down.
Who was Walter Scott ?
Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward.
 He was there. God planned that. He's the ram in the bush -- I truly believe that, Judy Scott said.
Santana agreed.
 I think she was right, he said. God put me there for a reason. 
Judy Scott said she could n't watch the whole recording.
 When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I could n't take it, she said. I had to turn away. I could n't handle it.
In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution.
 At some point I thought about staying anonymous, and do n't show my face, do n't talk about it. But... if I would n't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am, Santana said.
Santana did not say whether he had received threats.
His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention.
In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands.
Witness video, official accounts raise questions
Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR.
A police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person with first aid and CPR. 
On Wednesday, asked whether CPR was performed on Scott, North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers said: In the end of it -LRB- the video -RRB-, what I saw was -LRB- what I -RRB- believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving -LRB- procedure -RRB-, but I 'm not sure what took place there.

"The United States is a country that has people from all over the world. Not only do many people speak different languages, many people practice different religions. Most people in the U.S. identify as being Christian, but only half of those people attend church on a regular basis. The second most popular religion is Judaism. The third most common religion in the U.S. is Islam. Other religions practiced in the U.S include Hinduism, and Buddhism. About 20 percent of all people in the U.S. say they don't practice any religion. One of the founding principles of the United States is religious freedom, which means people can practice whatever religion they want without being discriminated against. This is even guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. This is one reason why the United States has no official religion.
 
Because there are so many different religions in the United States, there are many different types of houses of worship. Christians attend churches. Jews and Hindus attend temples. Muslims attend mosques. Many people use what they wear to reflect their religious beliefs. For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called ""hijab"" to cover their head. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to take off her hijab or ask for her to show you what is under it. Male followers of an Indian religion called ""Sikhism"" usually wear cotton turbans. Again it is wrong to take a person's turban off or ask that they take it off. Male followers of Hasidism, a branch of Judaism, have long curls on the side of their heads. They wear a fringed prayer shawl. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called a yarmulke. This is supposed to be a constant reminder that God is above them.",B1
"In her uniform of a crisp, classic white shirt, Carolina Herrera exudes the kind of elegance and easy grace that has defined her fashion label for more than 30 years.
It's a look that has been sought after by some of the world's leading ladies, from style icon Jackie Onassis to actress Renee Zellweger and comedian Tina Fey, who stepped out in a navy Herrera gown at this year's Oscars.
Herrera's rise to the top of the cutthroat world of fashion started in 1981, when she launched her flagship Carolina Herrera brand in New York.
Today, her empire encompasses the signature fashion collection, a bridal collection, fragrances and accessories. Herrera has more than 280 stores in 104 countries and all this brings in billions of dollars.
Herrera says she was more interested in horses than fashion growing up in Caracas, Venezuela, where here father was Governor. But adds that she was lucky to always be surrounded by exquisitely dressed women. Today, the women in her life include her four daughters, two of whom also work for the Carolina Herrera brand.
Here, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.
On building a business...
-LRB- Fashion is -RRB- a very difficult business, as you know, because fashion is a business. If you do n't sell, then you are not in the business.
You might be the best designer and you are so creative and new, have the most beautiful ideas, but if they all stay in your room and they do n't go out to be worn by someone, then you are not in business.
The most difficult -LRB- part -RRB- of this business is to have the right teams, because I -LRB- could not have done -RRB- everything I have done alone.
If I -LRB- did n't -RRB- have my teams behind me, I would n't be sitting here. Fashion is a collaboration with many people.

On the Herrera team...
I have a team, a fantastic president who takes care of the numbers of the company. If you ask me to take care of that side, I would be sitting there crying because I do n't know what to do. If I ask her to design clothes, she would n't know how to do -LRB- it -RRB-. But I always tell the young designers that you have to separate the creative side with the business side. You have to have somebody very capable to run the business side. Because then, you 're successful.
On style...
Style is something so different in everyone. But a style is something that you do that is totally different from the other or something that you 're wearing that is the same as the other person but it looks different on you. It's a special touch. Some people have it and some people can not.
On juggling work and family life...
We women manage to do many things at the same time. Men, no. Men do one thing at a time. I see my husband say why are you doing all these at the same time ? You 're going to do something wrong here. '
I say, No.Because women, we are able to do that. Because we have children; we have to work sometime; we run a house; we have a husband and everything works. It's a question of organizing yourself.
More from Leading Women: Women ! Embrace your inner geek
On the Carolina Herrera brand...
I think women in Carolina Herrera... I like them to be sophisticated and I like them to be classic with a modern twist.
You can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have the accessories from CH and it's like a lifestyle.
On dressing for your age and figure...
It's about finding the style for the right figure or the right age. Sometimes you see women that do n't realize that age is changing your style, and they do n't change.
What you wore when you were 15 does n't look that well when you 're 30 and certainly looks terrible when you 're older. So, you have to change with the times. It's the same thing with a fuller figure or a very thin one.
On the white blouse...
The white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because you can dress it up or you can wear it with jeans or you can wear it with a ball gown. I mean with a ball skirt. It's so easy.
For me it's like a security blanket. When I do n't know what to wear, I say a white blouse. You can give your own look to it.
More from Leading Women: Interactive: Power in the boardroom: Women versus men
On fashion egos...
You have to deal with the fashion egos. You know, there is a lot. It should n't be treated that seriously because fashion is only making dresses to make women look beautiful. We 're not inventing anything new.
On her inspiration...
The inspiration comes from things that you have seen all your life. Sometimes you see collections that are inspired by the '20s and the '30s and the '40s and the '50s. That means fashion is a repetition of ideas. It's the way you put it together that makes it modern...
On her managerial style...
I do n't think I like to go around shouting. I do n't believe in this. I believe that you have to treat the people who work with you like your family.
On advice for women going into fashion...
First of all you have to love it. Second you have to remember that it's not going to be easy. You have a lot of problems. You have to have perseverance. You have to do it even if it does n't work and you have to keep going. You have to be strong about it. They have to have the talent to do it, because without talent, how can you do fashion ?

"Two years ago, Amy left her small hometown in England and moved to one of the biggest cities in the United States -- New York. Amy knew the transition would be difficult at first, but was confident that she would love her new life and succeed in becoming a Broadway star. She had envisioned herself getting off the airplane and immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring The City That Never Sleeps.
 
Unfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had imagined. Her days were spent jumping from theatre to theatre looking for auditions. Although she was very pretty, and great at acting, her accent made it difficult for her to get hired for any roles. Directors kept telling her to work on her American accent, but the more she practiced it, the more she sounded like a cowboy rather than a New Yorker.
Amy's nights were spent working at a diner in order to pay for her ridiculously expensive one-room apartment where the sinks always leaked and the hot water never worked. To top it all off, the city that she had imagined as being filled with bright lights and friendly faces like in the movies was made up mostly of smelly alleys, big rats, and angry crowds that were always in a hurry to get somewhere. Still, Amy didn't let anything crush her spirits, and was determined to keep working hard until her dreams would come true.
Finally one day, Amy was clearing some tables in the diner while singing her favorite song as usual. ""Excuse me,"" said a man in a nearby booth. ""I couldn't help but notice that you have a beautiful voice."" Amy blushed and thanked the man. ""I'm actually casting for a star in my new Broadway musical of Mary Poppins,"" he continued. ""How would you feel about acting?"" Amy's heart raced with excitement just as Frank Sinatra's ""New York, New York"" began playing on the diner's jukebox. She was finally going to make it.

"Food trucks used to be somewhere fast to get meals for office workers in cities across the United States. The food used to be just average, certainly nothing to boast about. Food trucks were a matter of convenience, and usually offered inexpensive meals. At lunchtime in cities across the United States, workers lined up to order a sandwich and a canned soda. The meal rarely cost more than five dollars. They took their food and ate as they walked. Some workers would take their food back to their offices and eat in the company lunchroom or at their desks.
 
Food trucks have come a long way. They are no longer thought of as just fast food on wheels. Now food trucks are considered a gourmet dining experience. There are food trucks selling cuisine from all over the world. There are Korean barbecue food trucks and food trucks that sell lobster rolls. There are even food trucks that specialize in desserts. These dessert food trucks sell more than just ice-cream cones. They sell cakes and pies. There're even cupcake trucks.
Food trucks have become so popular that many use social media to reach customers and create a fan base. Some food trucks use Twitter to let customers know what their menu for the day. Other food trucks use Facebook to let customers know on what corner they will be parked.
These clean food trucks, with their gourmet food and large fan base, are not a bargain anymore though. Rarely can you get a meal from a food truck for less than ten dollars. Some people think the price is worth the quality. Others just bring sandwiches from home.

"It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided to go for a swim off Doolin Pier in County Clare, Ireland, where I moved in 2012. There was a woman in the water with Dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. 
Dusty arrived in Doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that she's totally tame. She has even starred in an Irish tourist-board ad campaign in which a girl says she would like to touch a dolphin. 
That evening, this woman was tickling Dusty's tummy and it just looked so inviting. There were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. Just after I got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was with and went ballistic - I found out afterwards that she's very territorial when she is with somebody. Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it was a display but, then, I twigged: maybe she's angry. I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam towards the pier but, within microseconds, Dusty had ploughed into me with her snout. It was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. I went hurtling forwards. 
All these people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. Dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. That was more frightening than anything: I thought, if she hits me with her tail, I could go under; I'm gone. 
I was at the pier but couldn't get out because of my injuries. I felt pure terror. I shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. Then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon who specialized in marine trauma. He had been driving into Doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. I was so cold and very worried - I didn't know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. He checked me over and was very reassuring, saying he couldn't feel any evidence of it but that I probably had broken bones. I found out later that I had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung. 
I was in hospital for five days, in a back brace for several weeks and off work for five months with limited mobility, stiffness and pain. Then, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. My near-death experience had left me anxious about everything and overreacting in a way I had never done before. I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, I began to struggle with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss. Three months before the accident, I had opened a health-food shop but I had to let it go because I could no longer work. It was the toughest year ever but, now, it's all behind me. I had craniosacral therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. I have a new empathy with patients because I have been one. 
I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to prevent other people being injured. We have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them - who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? If you see a ferocious animal coming at you with its teeth bared, it's scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile. 
I don't have any anger towards Dusty. I respect her. But I was in her territory and she's a wild, unpredictable animal. People need to know that. So many come here to swim with her and they don't understand how dangerous it can be. Mine were reportedly among several injuries that summer. 
After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was bobbing vertically next to me, looking at me. We locked eyes and I felt there was complete remorse in her. She was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. The people on the pier were in awe. When she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. I made my peace with her.  ",B1
"On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the town's founder, a noted Norwegian engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde. The great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him. 
Behind him, to the south, rises the equally sheer 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once mighty, town that Eyde built in the early years of the last century, to house the workers for his factories. 
Eyde harnessed the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the world's biggest power plant. 
But one thing he couldn't do was change the elevation of the sun. Deep in its east -west valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but it's certainly not bright, either. 
Recently, however, Eyde's statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling. High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight. 
""It's the sun!"" grins Ingrid Sparbo, disbelievingly, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people ""do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It's mentally warming."" 
Two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it's ""awesome. Just awesome."" 
Pushing his child's buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. ""It's a funny thing,"" he says. ""Not real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight."" 
Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. ""But it's far more than I expected,"" she says. ""This will bring much happiness."" 
Across the road, in the Nye Tider cafe, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001. 
The first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil , or Sun mirror , came to him as the month of September began to fade: ""Every day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,"" he says, ""and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun."" By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan's market square. It doesn't reappear until 12 March. 
Throughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says, ""We'd look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. It's sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun."" 
Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in so-called CSP - concentrated solar power - helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. ""It took,"" he says, ""a bit longer than we'd imagined."" 
It really works. There were objectors - and plenty of them - petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a waste of money. But even they now seem largely won over. 
""I was strongly against it,"" admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere - on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan's old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing. 
""And I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,"" he says. ""What will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the people's faces."" 
In his office overlooking the square, Rjukan's energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town. 
Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and Rjukan's shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit. A hi-tech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. 
""This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,"" Bergsland says, and, helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone - GBP100,000 - of the mirrors' total 5m-krone cost. 
And, seen against the town's 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn't very much to pay for something that ""gives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it's actually here, people love it.""

"Charles Lindbergh is an American hero, who took the nation, and the world by storm as a 25-year-old pilot in 1927. That was the year Lindbergh flew from New York City to Paris across the Atlantic Ocean solo. Aviation technology was not very advanced during that time period. Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was believed by many to be simply too small to make the solo flight across the great Atlantic. Just carrying enough fuel for the flight was a challenge, and so was the trip itself. Because of the limitations on the speed of aircraft at the time, it would take many hours to make the trip; it was generally accepted that a pilot could not make it alone. Lindbergh would not be deterred though.
 
Lindbergh was working as a mail pilot when he decided to make his cross-Atlantic flight. Six well-known and trained aviators had lost their lives trying to make the flight before him, so his odds for success were not in his favor. On the morning of May 20, 1927, Lindbergh launched his small plane from Roosevelt Field in New York, and determined to reach Paris. The flight was an international event as Lindbergh's progress was reported by report stations throughout his flight. Lindbergh faced many dangers and challenges during his flight, including foul weather, and flying blind through thick fog. He also had to fight his fatigue during the nearly 54-hour flight.
It was all well worth the trouble when Lindbergh landed in Paris on Saturday night, May 21, 1927. More than 150,000 French citizens had gathered to join the celebration of his historic flight. Lindbergh had become an international superstar literally overnight. He came home to an adoring the American public that celebrated his fame with a parade through the streets of New York City.",B1

Subject: 32 Acacia Avenue electricity problem
Dear Sam,
I'm writing on behalf of myself and my flatmates about Number 32 Acacia Avenue as we've been having problems with the electricity.
We noticed that if we use more than one appliance at night when the lights are on, the power cuts out. This means that we can't use the dishwasher at the same time as the oven, for example. For a while we have been careful but recently we have found that even in the daytime, more than one machine running can cause a power cut. Occasionally, the power cuts out for no obvious reason.
We know the electrician who came before couldn't find anything wrong, but please can someone come again as the problem is getting worse? If it would be easier, we can arrange an electrician ourselves and send you the bill.
Kind regards,

"Many young American boys and girls dream of becoming a rock star at one time or another in their lives. American culture is largely defined by the music young people enjoy. During the 1960s, music in the United States was greatly influenced by the social issues of the day. Many call the decade a revolutionary period in the country's history, and music was a big part of that revolution.
 
When David was young, he was in love with the Beatles. The English band was possibly the most impactful group of the generation. It revolutionized music like no band or artist before them. Most young boys wanted to be Paul McCartney, or John Lennon - the two founders of the band. Becoming rich and famous in America is one of the attractions of living in the U.S., and becoming a rock star is one way of achieving this. David knew this, so he got together with three of his friends and convinced them to form a band together.
Many American Rock 'N' Roll bands began their journey in someone's garage. One notable group to start this way was Van Halen. David and his friends were convinced they could become the next Beatles with a little luck and a lot of practice.
The band practiced regularly over the years, and soon became good enough to perform before some young audience, but they never hit the big time unfortunately. The road to success in the music industry is not an easy one to travel, but that does not deter some American dreamers. David's philosophy was ""You never know what the future holds,"" and is engaged in the music industry to this day. A couple of his original band members are also in the industry enjoying marginal success, and are still pursuing their dream.",B1
"Good people, not to mention good tippers, do exist. Christina Summitt knows that for sure now after what happened Saturday night.
The paw-print tattoo on Summitt's wrist often leads to conversations with strangers about her love of animals; she's a volunteer with a pit bull rescue group and spends lots of time finding homes for animals of all kinds.
While tending bar at the Holiday Inn in Clinton, New Jersey, Summitt got to chatting with a friendly couple before the night got busy. The man asked her if she had dogs of her own; she confided that her baby, a Great Dane-black Labrador mix named Tucker, was at the veterinary hospital after having emergency surgery hours earlier after he swallowed a hard plastic ball. She was worried about him.
The man said something about surgery being expensive. She confided the estimate was around $2,700, but she would do whatever she had to do for the dog, whom she adopted in 2011. Summitt, 37, works three jobs -- full-time as a chef at the hotel, Saturdays as a bartender, and as a food prep worker two days a week at a deli in her town. Her husband works full-time and Summitt has three stepchildren.
The couple ordered drinks and dinner at the bar. When it was time to close out their $80 tab, the man filled out the receipt with a tip -- for $1,000.
Summitt said she started shaking and crying. She showed the bill to her sister, who tends bar with her, to make sure she was seeing three zeros after the 1.
 I went back over and said Sir, I can not accept this, what is this for, why would you do this ? she said. He told her to put it toward Tucker's medical costs.
 I just stood there in shock. I walked around and hugged this couple. They said, We 'll be praying for Tucker.
Hotel manager Michelle Satanik told CNN she followed up with her comptroller and also tracked down the customer this week to verify that the gesture was legitimate. CNN has attempted to contact the generous tipper through Summitt, who kept his name anonymous for his privacy.
 Apparently this man does this quite frequently. Just a really nice guy and humanitarian, Satanik said. I have never ever seen a $1,000 tip like that. 
Summitt shared the story on Facebook and CNN iReport with a photo of the credit card slip and a picture of Tucker being held by her 16-year-old stepson before they left the dog at the hospital for surgery. A Facebook page she follows called Why Bartenders and Servers Hate People reposted the story on Easter Sunday with this caption: This is a place for us to vent but every so often, especially on holidays, we have to be thankful for the amazing customers that are out there. 
Summitt says she's since gotten messages of support from all over the world.
 I would also love nothing more than to publicly thank this couple in front of the world. I 've never seen a random act give so many people so much hope, she wrote.
Tucker is recovering at home.

"Phil Jackson is an American basketball coach, and general manager. He used to be a basketball player, and played for several seasons in the National Basketball Association during the 1970s. He played for the New York Knicks for most of his career after being drafted by the team in 1967. He was a top reserve player for the Knicks team that won the NBA Championship in 1973. Because of a spinal injury, he did not continue to play for the team. Jackson was an average player, who found some success in the NBA, but his phenomenal success in the league came as a coach.
 
As coach of the Chicago Bulls, Jackson's teams won six titles in nine years. He was hired in 1987 by the Bulls as an assistant coach, and took over the head coaching job in 1989. Helping him win the titles was Michael Jordan. Jordan is one of the most successful athletes ever to play the game of basketball. Many people claim that Jackson was able to win his six titles because of Jordan, while others point out that Jordan preceded Jackson without ever winning a title. In any event, the duo worked, and the rest is NBA history.
Jackson join the Los Angeles Lakers as coach in 2000. The Lakers were in a similar situation as the Bulls during that time. The team had plenty of talent, but lacked leadership. Jackson, once again, provided that. During his time with the Lakers, Jackson's teams won five NBA titles, nearly matching the Bulls run. Jackson also benefited from having Kobe Bryant and other talented players on his roster, but his success was now firmly cemented in basketball lore. Jackson is currently the general manager of his old team, the New York Knicks.",B1
"For many years, gambling in the United States was legal only in the state of Nevada. Nevada is a western state that is east of California, south of Oregon and Idaho, west of Utah, and north of Arizona. It is a desert state where little rain falls during the year. It is a little more than 275 miles from the city of Los Angeles, which is where most of its visitors come from. Driving from Los Angeles is about four hours. Las Vegas, which means the Meadows in Spanish, was established by the Mexicans in the mid-1800s. Much of what is now the southwestern part of the United States was then part of the Mexican Empire. The city was a railroad town established in 1905, and the first legal casino appeared in 1931.
 
Las Vegas is now a gambling town, where people from all over the United States come to vacation. Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling, including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called ""The Strip."" With its nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S.

"Health insurance is one way to pay for health care. Health care includes visits to the doctor, prescription medication, and emergency services. People can pay for medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary care provider.
 
Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes. Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare or for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).",B1
"Guide to Digital Games and Learning
How can games unlock a rich world of learning? This is the big question at the heart of the growing 'games and learning'
movement that's gaining momentum in education. The Guide to Digital Games and Learning explains key ideas in
game-based learning, pedagogy, implementation, and assessment. This guide makes sense of the available research,
and provides suggestions for practical use.
The Guide to Digital Games and Learning started as a series of blog posts
written by Jordan Shapiro with support from the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at
Sesame Workshop and the Games and Learning Publishing Council. We've
brought together what we felt would be the most relevant highlights of Jordan's
posts. We wanted to create a dynamic, in-depth guide that answers many of the
most pressing questions that educators, parents, and life-long learners have
raised - questions around using digital games for learning. While we had
educators in mind when developing this guide, any lifelong learner can use it to
develop a sense of how to navigate the games space in an informed and
meaningful way.
We urge you to read it. Start with the introduction that provides an overview of games in the classroom. Then go straight to
the second section which presents the way in which the research around digital games is evolving and talks about how
pediatricians, academics, educators, and researchers are working to find answers to how games and technology affect
learners of all ages. The third section, on 'How to Start Using Digital Games for Learning', provides examples of how some
educators are using digital games in the classroom and how they find support when running into difficulties. The next
section, 'How to Choose a Digital Learning Game', gives you a starting point for game selection by providing an
understanding of the types of games available in the marketplace and how to go about selecting them. Ideas about how to
overcome obstacles for using digital games in the classroom are presented in the next section and, finally, the last section
takes an in-depth look at how some teachers are using games in the classroom and their real-life struggles and victories.",B1
"An evacuation order was lifted Wednesday morning for more than 500 California homes on hillsides vulnerable to mudslides, authorities said.
With the sun shining over much of Los Angeles, officials told people who live in the foothill areas of La Crescenta, La Canada Flintridge and Acton that they could return to their homes at 8 a.m. PT -LRB- 11 a.m. ET -RRB-.
Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for those residents Tuesday morning as a precaution when heavy rains were predicted.
The dangerous mudslides did not develop, but this area was especially hit hard after a downpour Saturday unleashed a river of mud that damaged dozens of homes.
Several of the homes were declared uninhabitable.
A massive wildfire in the Angeles National Forest last summer burned hillsides where these homes are located.

"Generally people's ""class"" is defined by how much money they make. In the U.S. generally there are three classes: poor, middle class, and rich. Some people also think there is another class in between poor and middle class called working class. United States culture is based on the idea that people can move up the economic ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea of going from ""rags to riches"". Moving up the class ladder is not easy though. Higher education needed to get a good paying job is expensive.
 
Class in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes though. Education, what job a person has, where they live, and the culture, all play a role in what class a person will be classified as. For example, a person with only a high school diploma and a low-paying service job may be considered poor or low class. While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be considered high class or wealthy. In a way this makes sense because high-paying jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.
Gender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder. Women earn less than men do, so it is harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to move up the economic ladder. In the United States, most families require both the man and woman to work in order to support the household.",B1
"NASA will launch Space Shuttle Endeavour on February 7, which will be the first of five launches this year before the shuttle fleet is retired.
Endeavour will blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a 13-day mission to the international space station.
The mission will include three spacewalks, NASA said. The shuttle will also deliver the final U.S. portion of the space station. This portion will provide more room for crew members.
NASA plans to retire its space shuttles Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis later this year.
The space agency has been looking for places, such as museums, to house the shuttles after they are retired.
Space Shuttle Discovery will be transferred to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
The privilege of showing off a shuttle wo n't be cheap -- about $29 million, NASA said.

"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?
British education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.
One thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9-16 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.
Those negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.",B1

"Vega, New York
Reviewed yesterday
Great mains, pity about the chips
Came for lunch with my sister. We loved our Thai-style mains which were amazing with lots of flavour, very impressive for a vegetarian restaurant.
But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish.
When we arrived at 1.40, we had to wait 20 minutes while they got our table ready. OK, so we didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was only half full. There was no reason to make us wait at all.
We ordered the chips as a side dish and they looked delicious. But, when we tasted them, they were overcooked and swimming in oil so we left most of them. We expected a lot more for $10!
When the waiter asked if everything was ok, we said we really didn't like the chips and he said 'That's funny, I love them' and that was it. He didn't offer us anything else or take them off our bill. Also, when we didn't leave a tip, he looked annoyed.
I was really excited about visiting Vega, and the mains were just fantastic, but the rest of the experience was really disappointing.",B1
"December is truly a special time. People start putting up their Christmas decorations and lights outside their homes. Christmas is wonderful, because family members from far-away come to visit. We eat, drink, and talk about how our lives are going. One of my favorite things to do when my family comes over to visit is go for a ride in my dad's car and see all the houses with their Christmas lights on.
 
Last year, my dad told us that he had seen a neighborhood with the whole block filled with houses with lights. We decided to go see them. The whole family crammed into two cars. We drove for about 40 minutes. When we got there, our faces lit up with joy at the sight of all the lights. My cousins decided that they wanted to walk outside and watch the lights. We all got out and started walking, but when it was time to go back home, we didn't notice that my youngest brother was not in the car.
He had separated from the family, and went to see a house all the way at the end. No one noticed, and we left him there for an hour. He knocked on the house that he went to see, and told the people that lived there what had happened. He knew my cell phone number, and so he called me. We were about to arrive at my house when I got the call. I told my dad, and he nearly crashed the car, because he got so scared.
We dropped everyone off and I decided to go with my dad to pick up my brother. When we arrived at the house, my brother was sitting on the couch watching television with the children that lived there and drinking hot chocolate. My dad hugged him and said sorry. The people who lived there said that it was fine that their children liked my brother because he was funny. They said he could come back anytime. I was relieved nothing had happened to my brother.",B1
"Living in Southern California has its advantages. One of those advantages is living so near the mighty Pacific Ocean. It is the largest ocean in the world -- big, blue, and beautiful. One of my favorite pastimes when I was growing up was taking a long drive up Pacific Coast Highway. It is a beautiful drive, winding lazily in and out of sight of the sea, and going up hills and down coastal valleys. For first-time cruisers, it could be breathtaking.
 
One lazy Saturday, I was a bit bored, so I called my girlfriend, who was studying for her English test on the coming Monday, to see if she wanted to go for a ride. ""Hey Sheila, want to go for a cruise?"" She hemmed and hawed for a while before finally agreeing to go with me. ""Where are we going?"" she asked, but I wanted it to be a surprise. She had been hitting the books pretty hard lately because of her upcoming mid-term exams. I figured she needed a break, and so did I.
We started driving. Soon we were going through the Santa Monica tunnel. This tunnel is especially nice. When you enter it, you have no clue what is waiting at the other end. As soon as the exit comes into view, the ocean, in all its glory, appears right before your eyes. Sheila was instantly delighted. She turned to me after a while and said ""Thanks, baby. I really needed this."" I said ""Me too, babe.""
We talked for what seemed like hours. After that we went up and down, left and right, with the ocean as our companion. We ended up in Santa Barbara, a coastal town about 140 miles north of Los Angeles. It was getting late, so we decided to stay for the night. Santa Barbara is a college town, so it's easy to find affordable rooms to spend the night. That was one of the best nights of my young life.",B1
"It's never too late to learn. Emily Johnson had turned thirty when she decided to go back to college to finish her degree. Ten years had passed since she last attended East Los Angeles College. It had been her dream to finish her two years at ELAC and transfer to Cal State L.A. Emily was not able to finish because she started working. Even though Emily found a good job, she still had the urge to complete her education. After all, what kind of example would she be setting for her daughters by not receiving her degree? Emily wanted her children to succeed by going to college and getting a better career than she had.
 
Emily was aware of the difficulties of going to school while working and taking care of two daughters. She braced herself and accepted the challenge. She went to work during the daytime, and went to class in the evening after taking her daughters to her mother's house. Emily had to maintain this routine for one year in order to transfer. Sure enough, she made it through, and was accepted into Cal State L.A.
Emily's time at the university was slightly more grueling compared to community college. She had been studying sociology. The same challenges presented themselves again. Emily had only completed her general education classes at community college, and now the focus was in her subject of interest.
Emily passed all her classes with flying colors in a span of two years. It took all her dedication and will power to finish her education. Emily received her bachelor's degree in sociology. Her daughters would look up to their mother in the years to come and realize that it's never too late to go back to school.",B1
"Governments across Europe dream of finding a magic solution to rising unemployment. But, in the hardest-hit parts of the EU, joblessness rates continue to creep up and the rhetoric does little to shorten the dole queue. 
Now, in a struggling corner of Italy, one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his town's chronic lack of work - although, rather than a solution, it appears to some to be more of an admission of defeat. Valter Piscedda, the centre- left mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinia's capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons, board a cheap flight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe. 
""This is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience,"" he told the Guardian. ""Over the past year and a half - especially in the past few months - I have been receiving young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work. Some are looking here and ask for a hand in finding it here. Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. And they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too. 
""So, my reasoning was this: put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to,"" he said. 
As the national economy continues to falter, Sardinia, along with much of southern and central Italy, is grappling with high unemployment, with the overall joblessness rate at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to Italy's National Institute of Statistics, Istat. More than 54% of people under 25 are out of work. 
For the Adesso Parto (Now I'm leaving) programme, Elmas's council has allocated EUR12,000 on a first-come, first-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50. As long as they are out of work and have lived in the town for three years, they are eligible. They do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than EUR15,000. 
The idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when floods of Italians - many of them bright young graduates - are leaving their country every year. But Piscedda, who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, denies he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending away may well return ""and give me back 100 times what they were given"". More importantly, he wants the scheme to give a leg-up to those most in need. 
""It's a programme for those with no other resource; it's the last-chance saloon. It's about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that cannot do it,"" he said. 
Earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given financial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas. ""We advertised 20 of these positions,"" he said. ""We got 120 applications."" 
In Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions. ""The reality is that there is little work here,"" said Alessandro Macis. ""The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. The son of a friend of mine who didn't study much has ended up in London and he's really finding his way. He started as a waiter. Now, he's a cook and he's learning English."" 
Others were perplexed. ""I heard about it but I thought it was strange. If you have that money to pay for people to go away, why don't you use that money to keep them here?"" said Consuelo Melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafe. On Twitter, one of many reactions was disbelief. ""The state's admission of defeat,"" commented Marco Patavino. ""Institutions are raising the white flag,"" remarked Carlo Mazzaggio. 
Piscedda, however, is undeterred, remarking of his online critics: ""Probably, they are people that aren't in need ... Every day, I deal with people's problems and I have to do something to try to solve them. These people, if they had an alternative, they wouldn't be asking for help. 
""The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary. I can have a piazza cleaned. I can have it cleaned again. I can have the streets cleaned. But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. I want to go beyond that.""

"As a young competitive gymnast, Melissa Stockwell's heart would fill with pride as she looked at the American flag and sang the national anthem before every meet. When anyone would ask her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would say she wanted to join the Army.
Stockwell's parents thought she was going through a phase, but she joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After graduating with a communications degree in 2002, she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps.
At 23 years old, Stockwell was deployed to Iraq in March 2004. Less than a month later, her life changed forever. She was part of a routine convoy going through central Baghdad when a big explosion went off.
 Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts to swerve, she recalls. The woman in the front yells IED, IED, we 've hit an IED ! 
Stockwell's left leg was gone. It sounds strange, but as soon as I was told I did n't have my leg, I knew it was going to be OK, the veteran says. I just kind of had this almost peaceful feeling that, alright, it's going to be alright. Life is n't over. 
While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients.
 You see these other soldiers and these other veterans that are missing two limbs, three limbs, sometimes four limbs... and I looked at myself and I just really thought I 'm one of the lucky ones and I kind of made a decision then that I was going to live my life for those who could n't. 
Stockwell learned to walk with her new leg and become independent, but she knew she would n't feel like herself until she got back into sports.
 Luckily there are organizations out there that really grab the wounded veterans from their hospital rooms and get them out doing things that they may not have ever done with two legs, she says.
Four months after her injury, she went skiing in Colorado. The experience gave her an incredible feeling of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities.
After spending a year at Walter Reed, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient medically retired from the Army. Stockwell went back to school for a new career in prosthetics at Century College in Minnesota.
 Basically you fit amputees with artificial limbs, she says. I did n't know the field existed until I needed a leg, but then I thought, Well that's pretty cool.
After moving to Minnesota, she joined her first competitive swim team. A presentation about the Paralympics inspired her to fight for her country on a new battlefield.
 I dreamed of going to the Olympics when I was younger, she says. And now it was almost like I had a second chance. So I decided to try in the sport of swimming. It was easy for me to swim. I did n't have to wear a prosthetic leg. 
In 2008, Stockwell became the first Iraq war veteran to be chosen for the U.S. Paralympic Team. She felt like her life had come full circle: It made me feel so, so alive. 
Today the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetist at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club she started with friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago. Dare2Tri provides adaptive equipment and coaches for athletes with disabilities.
Cancer survivor and amputee Hailey Danisewicz says Dare2Tri has taught her that, my possibilities as a person are endless and that I can do anything that I put my mind to. 
In October Danisewicz placed second at the Paratriathlon World Championships in New Zealand. First place, for the third consecutive year, went to her coach and mentor Melissa Stockwell.

"Oprah Winfrey is one of the most successful women in the history of the United States of America. Winfrey was born in a small town in Mississippi in 1954 into a poor family. She is now one of the richest people in the world, and the richest black Americans in the country. She was also named as the richest African American in the 20th Century. Winfrey is known to most Americans through her daytime show called ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" Her show is very popular among television viewers because she likes to tackle the tough issues many other daytime TV hosts avoid.
 
Winfrey's early life was difficult. She lived with her mother and grandmother at times. While living with her grandmother, she learned to read by the age of three, and had memorized many bible passages. Her mother was an unwed teenager at the time of her birth, and had a difficult time raising her. Winfrey had two half-sisters. One died young as a result of cocaine addiction, and she did not learn about her other sister until 2010. Winfrey also was not certain who her father was.
Winfrey suffered from sexual abuse from her uncle, cousin, and family friend, and became pregnant at 14. She lost her baby shortly after birth though. Winfrey survived her early years, and at 17 won a local beauty contest before getting her first break in the media industry as a radio newscaster. This was her first step into the media market.
Her show began in Chicago in 1983, and within a few years, it became the No. 1 daytime, talk show in the country. She has interviewed some of the most famous people in the country on her popular show. Winfrey starred in the movie The Color Purple, and now owns her own production company called Harpo Films. She is a philanthropist who is famous for her generosity, and remains one of the most influential Americans in the country.",B1
"Donald Sterling is an American businessman who gained much of his wealth during the real estate boom in California many years ago. He is also the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, a professional basketball team of the National Basketball Association. Sterling has owned the Clippers since buying the team in 1981. Although Sterling is a very successful and rich man, his team has seen very little success in the NBA over the years. In recent years, the Clippers have made some strides in the league, having made the playoffs every year since 2011.
 
Sterling was recently in the news for a very different reason, though. On April 25, 2014, a controversial news and entertainment show aired a recorded conversation between Sterling and a female friend, where Sterling is heard making racial comments about some of her black friends. Sterling is not kind in his description of these friends. He said he did not want her bringing any black people to his Clippers games because he did not want her to be seen publicly with them.
Sterling's rant gained international attention. The NBA is made up of more than 90 percent black players, so many people questioned how Sterling could feel this way about many of his own employees. His comments created an immediate backlash from the black community and from Americans as a whole. He was under pressure from the NBA to sell the team after many black people commented that they no longer would attend his games.
The NBA has issued a lifetime ban against Sterling, which effectively prohibits him from entering any arena to view a basketball game for the rest of his life. Sterling challenged the ban, and refused to sell the team.",B1
"There are many traditions that U.S. brides and grooms are expected to follow at their wedding. One of the most well-known traditions is for a bride to toss her bridal bouquet to the unmarried female guests attending her reception. According to the tradition, the single woman who catches the bouquet will be the next woman to be married. The flowers thrown may not be actually the same flowers the bride carries down the aisle during the wedding ceremony. An identical bouquet is created for the bride to toss. This is because many times the bride wants to keep her original bouquet as a remembrance. Many women take the flower toss very seriously. There have been videos documenting how women will sometimes even fight each other for the bridal bouquet.
 
The groom has something to toss at the wedding reception, too. One tradition is the groom takes a garter from his new wife's leg and toss the garter to the unmarried men attending the reception. According to the tradition, the single man who catches the garter will be the next man to get married. Sometimes the groom will remove the garter from his wife's leg with his teeth. At some wedding receptions, the man who catches the garter has to place it on the leg of the woman who catches the bridal bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It is the decision of the bride and groom.
The bride and groom often toast each other with champagne before the end of the reception. Sometimes a bride and groom will leave the reception before it is over. They go right to the airport to begin their honeymoon, a special vacation celebrating their new life together.",B1

"When you rent an apartment, you need to check the lease for rules and responsibilities. For example, some landlords do not want you to have guests spend the night. This is because the landlord doesn't know who your guests are. If they damage the apartment in any way, you will be responsible. Also sometimes a friend who wants to crash on your couch ends up staying for a really long time, and ends up becoming another tenant.
 
You are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment. This means you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the landlord pays for any utilities, it will say so in the lease. Once you move in, you will have to call the electric company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your name. Also if you want a phone line, cable or Internet, you will have to call those companies and pay for those services yourself unless the lease says that is included in your rent.
Your landlord is supposed to have access to the apartment you are renting from them. This doesn't mean they can just barge in whenever. It does mean though that with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time the landlord will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules, and the landlord can also make any necessary repairs. All of this should be written out on the lease. If it is not, do not be afraid to ask the landlord to add that information. It protects both the landlord and you.",B1
"Barbara dropped out of college 17 years ago when she had her first daughter. She always regretted dropping out. She had been a good student, and enjoyed going to classes in college. However, when she had her daughter, she didn't have time to continue with her studies. She needed to find a full-time job.
 
Barbara also regretted dropping out of college because it was hard to find a good job without a college degree. While Barbara was lucky enough to always find work, some of the jobs she had didn't pay well. Most of them didn't offer benefits like vacation pay and health insurance. Barbara was sure that if she had a college degree, finding a better-paying job with benefits would be easier.
Barbara's daughter was now a teenager. She was beginning to look at colleges. This inspired Barbara to go back to school herself. Barbara wanted to finally get her bachelor's degree. Since her daughter was in high school, Barbara had more time. She didn't have to constantly watch over her daughter. However, even as a teenager, Barbara's daughter still needed to eat and needed clothes, so going to college on a regular schedule was not an option for Barbara.
Barbara went to the local community college to learn about her options. A college counselor told her that she could take online classes to finish her degree. Barbara was worried that these classes wouldn't give the same credit as a traditional college class would. The counselor told her the credits were the same, and online classes were good for non-traditional students like her. Barbara enrolled and became a student again.",B1
"Audie Murphy is the most decorated American war hero in the history of the United States military. He was honored with every award available during his years in the army during World War II. He also won awards for heroism from two foreign governments, Belgium and France. His military record is impressive, as he fought successfully in some of the most dangerous, and historic battles during the great war. Murphy also found success after the war as an actor who appeared in several films.
 
Murphy was born into a very large family in Hunt, Texas. He was one of 12 children, and grew up in abject poverty. His father deserted his family; his mother died at a young age, so Murphy dropped out of school to get work. Murphy held a series of odd jobs from an early age to help the family financially, but eventually realized that a military life was the best course to take.
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy knew he needed to be in the military to defend his country, but he was not yet old enough to enlist legally. With the help of one of his older sisters, who helped provide him with false records, Murphy enlisted into the Army at the age of 17. It wasn't long before Murphy began making his name in the military. He first saw action in the invasion of Sicily, and was involved in the liberation of Rome. He became famous for leading his men into a battle while he was wounded, and out of ammunition. He won several awards for valor.
After the war, he launched a successful Hollywood career. His most notable film was playing himself in the epic movie classic From Here to Eternity, which was based on his autobiography. Murphy starred in several western-themed films. He died at the age of 46 in a plane crash in the state of Virginia.",B1
"Car chases in the Los Angeles area are a fairly regular occurrence. In 2013 there were over 700 car chases. Car chases also have become a source of entertainment. Many car chases are captured on video and broadcast live as they are happening. No one has to wait until the six o'clock news comes on anymore to find out about what happened. People can tune in to their local broadcast television station and see it happening in real time. These car chases are often captured with the help of a news channel's helicopter. The helicopter follows and films the chase through the streets, reporting what streets the cars are passing through.
 
People like watching car chases for many reasons. They are intense, and filled with drama. A viewer never knows what will happen next. Will the driver give up easily? Does the driver have a weapon? Will the driver get into an accident? Will someone crossing the street get hit? Tune in to find out! Many channels see their ratings soar when they air car chases. They are just giving the people what they want.
Police are not always happy with the media covering car chases live on the air. Police worry that people trying to escape enjoy the attention. Police feel that broadcasting car chases encourages people to escape. Police also worry that the attention brings innocent bystanders to the street. Someone could get hurt. The media insists they have the right to show car chases. They feel they are informing the public.
Car chases happen for many reasons. Sometimes police will chase someone who stole a car. Other times the police may try to do a routine traffic stop. However, the driver with the broken taillight may have a warrant for arrest, so off he drives.",B1
"A prosecuting attorney greeted the jury in the George Zimmerman trial Monday with a quote full of expletives, while his adversary decided it was appropriate to tell jurors a knock-knock joke.
And that was just the beginning of opening statements in Zimmerman's long-anticipated murder trial.
In a case that has ignited national debate about gun laws and race relations, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, is accused of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012 in Sanford, Florida.
Prosecutor John Guy's first words to the six-woman jury may have raised a few eyebrows.
 Good morning. F ***** g punks, these a ****** s all get away, Guy quoted Zimmerman. These were the words in this grown man's mouth as he followed this boy that he did n't know. Those were his words, not mine. 
Zimmerman, Guy said, got out of his car with a pistol and two flashlights to follow Trayvon Benjamin Martin, who was walking home from a 7-Eleven, armed with a fruit drink and a bag of candy. Eventually the two became entangled on the ground in a fight. A witness has said Martin was on top of Zimmerman, Guy said.
 The defendant claims that while Trayvon Martin was on top of him, he said, you are going to die tonight, said Guy. Nobody heard that. 
Guy told jurors that no witnesses saw what happened the night of the shooting from beginning to end. Witnesses only saw slices of what happened, he said.
 We are confident that at the end of this trial you will know in your head, in your heart, in your stomach that George Zimmerman did not shoot Trayvon Martin because he had to, Guy said. He shot him for the worst of all reasons, because he wanted to. 
Fast facts: Trayvon Martin shooting
In the first day of testimony, jurors heard witnesses recount Martin's trip to the convenience store, Zimmerman's call complaining about a suspicious person walking through his neighborhood before Martin's killing, and a call from the previous August, in which Zimmerman reported an alleged burglary to police.
Proceedings ended for the day when defense attorney Mark O'Mara objected to the earlier call, which prosecutors argued was necessary to explain Zimmerman's remark about burglars who get away. 
The Martin family sat watching the proceedings behind State Attorney Angela Corey. Before witness testimony began, Judge Debra Nelson denied a defense request that Martin's father, Tracy Martin, leave the courtroom.
Tracy Martin is a potential witness, and potential witnesses can be forced to sit outside of the courtroom to keep their testimony from being tainted by other witnesses. But the next-of-kin of victims are allowed to remain in court even if they 're expected to testify.
O'Mara also accused Tracy Martin of using an obscenity toward a friend of Zimmerman's while holding the door for him during a hearing two weeks ago. The friend, Timothy Tucholski, testified that he had n't wanted to make an issue of it before.
 I was n't planning on coming up here. I do n't want to be sitting here, he said.
But Nelson denied the request, and Martin remained in court -- but Zimmerman's parents were covered by the rule regarding potential witnesses and had to sit outside, as did Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Martin's parents.
At one point, Martin's father began crying as Guy detailed how officers tried to save his son's life. Zimmerman has mostly stared straight ahead without any signs of emotion.
Following Guy's statement, defense attorney Don West came forward to woo the jury. As he began, he told a knock-knock joke. But it failed to win a laugh. Knock knock. Who's there ? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who ? Good, you 're on the jury, he said. Later, West apologized. No more bad jokes, I promise that, he told jurors. I was convinced it was the delivery. 
West quickly got on with the business of making his case: that Zimmerman was forced to act in self-defense to save his own life.
 The evidence will show this is a sad case; no monsters here.... George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder. He shot Trayvon Martin after he was viciously attacked. 
With the help of PowerPoint visuals, West spent hours hammering home his argument.
He broke down Zimmerman's 911 call in which he first reported seeing Martin and told about following him.
 Little did George Zimmerman know at the time in less than 10 minutes from him first seeing Travyon Martin that he, George Zimmerman, would be suckered punched in the face, have his head pounded on concrete and wind up shooting and tragically killing Trayvon Martin, West told jurors.
West also deconstructed a 911 call a neighbor made, in which it is possible to hear screams and a shot in the background that West said was the sound of the fatal bullet.
As the dramatic recording audio filled the courtroom, Zimmerman showed no emotion. Martin's mother left the courtroom.
 At the moment this actually became physical was that Trayvon Martin -- I will use my words -- that Trayvon Martin decided to confront George Zimmerman, West said. That instead of going home. He had plenty of time. This is, what, 60 or 70 yards. Plenty of time. He could 've gone back and forth four or five times. 
West quoted a witness named John Good who described the fight. He called it a ground and poundby Martin, who he said was on top of Zimmerman, beating him. 
 He saw enough that this was serious, West said. Zimmerman cried out for help, looked at Good and said, help me. But the beating continued while Good went inside his home to call 911, West said.
There was a shot. Shortly afterward, according to West, Zimmerman said Martin was beating me up, and I shot him. 
West also disputed the prosecution's claim that Martin was unarmed.
 Travyon Martin armed himself with the concrete sidewalk and used it to smash George Zimmerman's head, said West. No different than if he picked up a brick or smashed his head against a wall. That is a deadly weapon. 
West showed jurors photos taken of Zimmerman after the fight. What you can really see in these pictures that you will have in evidence are the lumps, West said. The big knots on each side of his head. Consistent with having his head slammed into concrete. 
All-female jury to try Zimmerman
Among the first prosecution witnessed called was the 911 dispatcher who took Zimmerman's call before the shooting. Seat Noffke testified that he was trained to give general commands instead of direct orders to people.
When Zimmerman said he was following Martin, Noffke told him, Okay we do n't need you to do that. Noffke told the prosecutor he's liable for any direct orders he gives someone.
On cross-examination, defense attorney O'Mara pointed out that Noffke asked Zimmerman, Which way is he running ? 
 If you tell somebody twice to let you know if the person that they 're concerned about is doing anything else -- do you think they 're going to keep their eye on them ? asked O'Mara.
 I ca n't answer that, said Noffke.
 You did tell him twice to let you know if that guy did anything else, said O'Mara.
 Yes sir, said Noffke.
Noffke went on to say he only wanted a location of the suspect for officers and that he never told Zimmerman to follow or keep his eye on Martin.
Shortly before court got under way, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, spoke to reporters, asking people to pray for me and my family because I do n't want any other mother to experience what I 'm going through now. 
Judge: No state expert testimony on 911 calls
Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.
In a CNN poll released Monday morning, 62 % of respondents say the charges against Zimmerman are probably or definitely true.

"Emma felt really bad when someone from her daughter Jessica's school informed her that Jessica needed special education services. Emma felt like she had failed as a mother. It was true that Jessica was always delayed when it came to learning to talk and walk. Emma just thought that her child was different. Every child develops at its own rate. Jessica was five years old now, but still was not speaking in complete sentences. Jessica would not be attending a regular kindergarten in a regular school. Instead, she would be attending kindergarten in a special education school.
 
While this bothered Emma at first, she soon learned to appreciate the school. Jessica had a specialized learning plan called an Individualized Education Plan or IEP. This plan set up specific goals for Jessica, like learning how to feed herself. Jessica also received a lot of individual attention. Instead of her being in a classroom with 20 students, there were only 8 students in her class. All of these students also were delayed like Jessica. In addition, the class had two teacher's assistants to help the classroom teacher.
The special education school also scheduled speech therapy sessions for Jessica. Once a day a specialist would come in and work with Jessica to help her practice learning how to move her mouth and tongue and ask for what she needed and wanted. An occupational therapist helped Jessica learn to feed herself and other age appropriate self-sufficiency skills. A physical therapist also came in to help Jessica.
Emma may have been embarrassed at first that her daughter was in a special education school, but after a year, Emma realized it was the best thing for her. While Jessica still was a little behind other kids of her age, at the end of kindergarten, she was able to attend a non-special education school.",B1
"When William worked in Santa Fe Springs, California, back in the 90s, he told me he thought the building he worked at was haunted. ""It really is,"" said William. ""I have had more than a few incidents happen to me while I was working alone, late at night,"" he continued. William was working as a manager for a very busy chemical distribution company at the time. In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at night, or go in on weekends to catch up with his paperwork.
 
William was a sensible man. He was not the type of person that would fly off the handle in troubling situations. He was always very calm, and composed. This is what made his story believable. I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.
One night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. His former manager had told him that he might hear some weird noises coming from the warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums expanding and contracting. During the heat of the day, the drums would expand, and at night, when it cooled off, the drums would contract, sometimes making a sound. William was not worried.
That night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. William dismissed it as a drum ""popping,"" and ignored it. A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it was louder. Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but continued working. Soon the noises got louder and louder. The final straw was when he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. This scared him quite a bit, but again he ignored it. Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. After that, William never worked at night again.",B1
"Whether you're travelling to the islands or the mountains of Thailand, you're likely to spend at least one night in its capital city on the way. Bangkok might be noisy and polluted but it's also an exciting city with plenty of things to see and do. Why not make it a longer stay?
Where to stay
The Khao San Road was a famous traveller spot even before Leonardo di Caprio's character in the film The Beach stayed there. But it's noisy, not very pretty and not very Thai. For something more authentic, Phra Kanong offers an alternative place to stay, with its fantastic street markets where everyday Bangkok people eat, work and live. It's not as convenient for the main tourist sites, but it has a Skytrain station so you can be at the Grand Palace in 20 minutes.
How to get around
Bangkok's traffic can be a nightmare. Sure, you can easily take a taxi - if you want to spend hours stuck in traffic jams - but there are two much better ways to get around the city. To explore the temples and historical sites, catch an express boat river taxi or a longtail boat along the Chao Phraya river and the canals. For the modern part of the city, the Skytrain is a fast, cheap way to travel from the river to the shopping malls and nightlife of Sukhumvit, and the famous Chatuchak street market.
Where to eat
The simple answer is: everywhere! Thai street food is among the best in the world, and for around $5 you can eat a filling and delicious meal. Some food stands have little plastic seats where you can sit and eat and they cook the same dish over and over, like fried chicken on rice or Pad Thai noodles. Head for Chinatown - Yaowarat Street - and choose whatever looks most interesting from the many excellent Chinese and Thai restaurants and food stands.  
What to do
After you've seen the main sites like the Giant Buddha at the temple of Wat Pho and the spectacular Grand Palace, and shopped at Chatuchak market, check out the snake farm and watch the live snake show. You can even touch a snake yourself if you want to!",B1
"Jacquelyn and her family were sleeping in their home. Their dog Scruffy was asleep next to Jacquelyn. It was 4:36 a.m. and the night was quiet. There were no cars passing in the street, no noise could be heard, it was like everything was still. Jacquelyn always put a cup with water next to her bed, so that if she got thirsty during the night she didn't have to walk all the way to the kitchen. That was when it happened. The furniture started shaking, and the cup of water fell to the floor. Scruffy started barking and it woke up Jacquelyn. She looked around and saw that all her stuff was shaking. She started screaming. Soon after, her father came in and told her to come out quick.
 
It was an earthquake. Jacquelyn was so scared, and couldn't move. Her father went in and picked her up. He took her outside, where Jacquelyn's mother and brother were at already. Jacquelyn and her brother were crying. They didn't understand what was happening.
Luckily, Jacquelyn's mother had prepared an emergency kit and had it outside. She looked for the key, which was hidden inside a fake rock, and unlocked the box. She pulled out blankets to keep her children warm. Jacquelyn looked at her mother and took the blanket. She then saw her dad take a flashlight from the box. He used the flashlight to see if the house had any damage. The father knew the house was not safe, so they stayed up until someone could examine the house.
The children didn't have school due to the earthquake, so they spent the day with their parents. Jacquelyn was so proud of her parents, because they knew what to do during this disaster. She talked to her friends, and they weren't so lucky. Jacquelyn went up to her mother and father and hugged them, because she knew she felt the protection of her parents.",B1
"The drought in the Southeastern United States means more than just brown lawns to the folks in Orme, Tennessee. Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening.
A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee.
The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and has n't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state.
Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry.
 When they cut it back on we jump for joy, Orme resident Debbie Cash said. And then you only have it for three hours. 
Three hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done. Watch how Cash copes 
The old mining town could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region. Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River.
 All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river is n't far behind, Reames said. See photos of a Atlanta's shrinking Lake Lanier reservoir 
Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2 1/2 miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day.
Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, does n't charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks. See where Orme has to go for water 
But things are looking up in Orme. A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government.
 With this new water coming in, then we 'll have it made, Cash said. Now we wo n't have to worry about it no more. 
In addition, an Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water-saving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17, company spokesman Robert Easter said.
 We think we 're going to get another 90 gallonssavings per day per household, Easter said. That 'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits. 
Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer.
It's a lesson for everyone.
 Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it, Cash said, because you never know if you will be out of water. E-mail to a friend

"Chris knew exactly where she was on January 28, 1986. As a matter of fact, nearly all Americans can recall what they were doing at the moment the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded. It is one of the most tragic moments in the history of the country, and it is one that will not be forgotten. Chris was working as a clerk at a clothing manufacturing plant in Commerce, California, which is about three miles from downtown Los Angeles.
 
On that morning she was filing some documents when one of her coworkers came through the door into a large work area that contained about 20 employees. ""The shuttle just blew up,"" he shouted. Most employees were taken aback. They had no idea what he was talking about. Once again he blurted out, ""The space shuttle just blew up in Florida."" Chris knew at that time something went very wrong.
The space shuttle program began in the early 80s, and continued to this day. The fleet consists of various shuttles that are designed to go into space, establish an orbit, and do a variety of tasks. It was heralded as a new era in space exploration. In the past, space exploration vehicles were used once, and then discarded. The shuttle program revolutionized the way space travel was done.
Chris couldn't believe her ears. Soon almost all employees huddled around the lunch room TV set watching in horror the events taking place. It was a sad day for the United States, but it was also the beginning of a new era in space travel. The country rebounded from this disaster and restarted its program after a couple of years. There have been other accidents in the program, and most notably the Columbia, which disintegrated upon reentry in February 2003, but the U.S. will not be deterred. Space travel is dangerous, but the spirit of the American people will not be contained.",B1
"A housewarming party is a special party to be held when someone buys or moves into a new apartment or house. The person or people who bought the property or moved are the ones who throw the party. The party is an opportunity for friends and family to congratulate the person on the new home. It also gives people a chance to see what the new home looks like. It is an opportunity to fill the new space with love and hopefully presents.
 
It is traditional to bring a gift to a housewarming party. Some people register a list of items they want or need for their new home at a local store or stores. Some common items people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and items like curtains. Even if there isn't a registry, a good housewarming gift is something to decorate the new house with like a piece of art or a plant. You can also bring food or drinks to share with the other guests. This is often appreciated since at a housewarming there isn't a lot of food served, usually just appetizers or sandwiches. There are usually no planned activities like games at a house warming party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack boxes. This isn't usual though.
Housewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most homes have central heating and don't use fires to keep warm.",B1
"Surfing was Jeffrey's favorite pastime. Every weekend Jeffrey and his best friend Chad would head to Santa Monica Beach, where they would surf big waves. California was the perfect place to live if you were a surfer. The sunny sky and nice temperature made it an ideal place for surfing. Best of all, California mostly maintains this kind of nice weather throughout the year. Jeffrey and Chad were grateful to be surfers in California and not in Iceland. While their other friends were skateboarding and rollerblading, Jeffrey and Chad were at the beach surfing the day away.
 
Jeffrey was fifteen years old when he first learned how to surf. Chad was two years younger when he started learning. They both had met at a surfing competition. Jeffrey was eighteen and Chad sixteen at the time of the competition. Despite being rivals at first, Jeffery and Chad soon became buddies after the competition. Now twenty-one and nineteen, Jeffrey and Chad had become the best surfers in the West Coast. Their medals and trophies were proof of this.
There wasn't anything more satisfying in the world than surfing the waters as the sun beamed from above and the wind blew by. Surfing was an exhilarating and incredible experience. It was also a great stress reliever. Jeffery and Chad felt as if they were on top of the world when surfing. Nothing else mattered when you were in the midst of a barrel ride. Jeffery and Chad knew that surfing for them would be a lifelong passion.
The beach was a great place to be at. This was especially true in the summer when pretty girls would gather on the weekends, bonfires would line the shores at night, and vendors and artists would attract visitors to purchase their wares. There was never a dull moment while at the beach. But if it wasn't for the waters, Jeffrey and Chad would have no reason to go to the beach.",B1
"Joel's school semester was ending soon, but he still had not found a job to keep him busy over the summer vacation. This wasn't the only reason Joel wanted a job. He had been taking the bus to school for over a year already. He was ready to start driving to school. All of his friends had been driving since the age of eighteen, and Joel felt like he was left behind. He had calculated the math and figured it would take him two months of working for him to be able to afford a used vehicle, or one month if he worked full time. Joel had it all planned out. The only problem was finding steady employment.
 
Joel felt like he had applied everywhere possible. He had walked into several fast food restaurants. He had stepped in countless coffee shops. He had visited various retail stores and supermarkets. Joel went around shaking the hands of managers, introducing himself as a college student who was interested in working. Joel mingled with employees and talk to frequent customers, in hopes of getting some recognition or even a piece of advice. After submitting application after application, it seemed like he would never get hired. Joel felt like giving up hope.
But then one afternoon, Joel received a call for an interview. Joel jumped for joy when he discovered the interview was for a job working at a bookstore. Joel was so determined to get the job that he was hired right after his interview. He had greatly impressed the manager, who felt he was the perfect candidate for the job.

"A man suspected in the deaths of three people in Panama is now wanted in the slaying of an American woman whose body was found last week, Panama's national police said Saturday.
The body of Cher Hughes, a native of suburban St. Louis, Missouri, was found Tuesday on the property of William Adolfo Cortez Reese, who is suspected in her death, said Javier Carrillo, director of the national police investigation unit.
Carrillo said Cortez and his wife, Jane, are on the run. Cortez may be from Holland. We 're not sure that's his real identity, he said. We found a false passport. 
He said Panamanian authorities are attempting to reach police in Holland.
Hughes, who was in her early 50s, was identified by her husband, Keith Werle, who lives in Panama. A second body -- which has not yet been officially identified -- was found near Hughes.
 We believe the motive is that he -LRB- William Cortez -RRB- is killing people to take their property, Carrillo said.
He added that authorities do not know Cortez's whereabouts, and have not received any tips from the public.
Werle said he was on Cortez's property, a massive piece of farmland on the island of Isla Colon in the western province of Boca del Toro, as police executed a search warrant. He said his dog led authorities to a shallow grave, where they found Hughesbody.
Dwayne Cooney, a family friend, said Hughes had lived in Panama for the past decade and owned a hotel, the Casa del Sapo, in Boca del Torro. He described Hughes and Cortez as friends and neighbors.
Hughes had lived in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she owned a neon sign business, before moving to Panama, Cooney said.

"Michael Buble is gearing up for his second wedding -- to the woman who's already his wife.
Slightly more than a month after his March 31 wedding to Argentine actress Luisana Loreley Lopilato de la Torre, the Canadian crooner is going for double the fun in a sequel ceremony this weekend in his home country -- with 500 of their closest friends and family, no less.
 We 're both nervous, but we 're excited, Buble, 35, tells Entertainment Tonight Canada.  It's just another excuse to celebrate our love, have a few drinks and to dance all night. 
RELATED: Michael Buble's Romantic Italian Holiday
Not that their first wedding was lacking, he says of his Buenos Aires ceremony, which was sealed with a celebration in a mansion outside the Argentine capital. It was a great night -- really, a beautiful night, Buble says. Her family is so special and my family is so special that when they came together, we danced 'til 7 a.m. 
He adds that his wife, who sparkled in a violet dress and silver high heels, looked so gorgeous and, ah, we were just saying before the cameras turned on that everyone says, Marriage -- nothing changes. Oh, it's just a piece of paper.But I love her more. It's obviously more serious, and you make some promises that are more important to keep. 
But the newlywed was n't just gushing about Lopilato, 23. Fresh off their three week-long honeymoon, he quips, it was time for another vacation -- from each other.
 If I look like I 'm content, it's because she's been in Argentina for a week and I 've been -LSB- in Canada -RSB-, he says, with a laugh. We love each other so much, we totally need a break.... By the end -LSB- of the honeymoon -RSB-, you want to kill each other. 
All kidding aside, I 'm happy, he says. I think she feels the same way, too.

"One of the most recent social changes taking place in the United States, and in the world, is social networking. Social networking in itself is not a new development. These types of groups have been in existence for at least 150 years, and probably longer than that. In the times before the invention of the personal computer, and the advent of the World Wide Web, social networking was done in person. People who had similar likes and interests would gather together to share experiences, make new contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.
 
On the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.
In 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have their own Facebook pages. Once you get started, making new friends will come easily.",B1

"Salem in the state of Massachusetts is called the ""Witch City"", but don't be afraid. There aren't women wearing pointy black hats riding around on brooms. The New England city is called the Witch City because of an infamous set of trials that happened there in 1692 to 1693. At the time, the city was just a town in the British colony of Massachusetts. The Salem Witch Trials accused more than 200 people of being witches. People believed witchcraft was real and was criminal. Among the accused were women, men, and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to death. They were all hanged. One of the accused was tortured with heavy rocks being placed on him until he was crushed underneath the weight. Seven others died in jail.
 
There was never any proof that those accused, and convicted were really witches. Historians think that people would accuse people because of family feuds. Other historians think that a domino effect occurred, with people becoming hysterical after one accusation. Fear of witches spread like a disease.
The Salem Witch Trials have become a part of the city's history. ""The Crucible"", a play about the trials by Arthur Miller, has been turned into a movie. The city is not ashamed of its past, but rather uses it to teach tolerance and earn some tourist dollars. There is a memorial dedicated to the innocent people who died because of the witch-hunts. There is a ""Witch Museum"" that tells the story of what happened. Many people visit Salem around Halloween. Salem police cars have witch logos. A local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, and the Salem High School sports teams are named the Witches. Films and television shows featuring fictional witches have been filmed in Salem, including ""Hocus Pocus"" and ""Bewitched"".",B1
"March 14 is my favorite day to be a nerd.
Across the country, math geeks in museums, schools, private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3.14. That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day. What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day.
A quick refresher: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance across it, or the diameter. It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences.
Throughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator. What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers. 3.1415926535897932... etc.. Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music.
On Pi Day, one number reeks of mystery '
Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day. One might even say -- gasp ! -- it's cool to like pi these days. Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009.
In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi. And so Pi Day is an acquired taste, mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail.
Conveniently, pi sounds like pie, and pies are round. You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza. If you 're in enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special already.
But if you happen to live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities.
Where Pi Day began
If you want to go where the day is said to be invented, look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium. Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, began the tradition in 1988. Last year was Pi Day's 25th anniversary there.
Pi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff. Now it's a public pi extravaganza featuring a Pi procession, whose attendees get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi's digits: 3.14159265... you get the idea.
The parade ends at the pi shrine -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year.
For those who ca n't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing. The museum also lists a bunch of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi.
On Pi Day, is piunder attack ?
Where Einstein lived
On the opposite coast, the leafy university town where Albert Einstein spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community-wide exuberance for pi.
Princeton, New Jersey, kicks off Pi Day weekend on Thursday night with a reading by physicist Charles Adler, then heads into a full day of activities on Friday, including a walking tour of Einstein's neighborhood and a pizza pie-making contest.
The pie-eating contest takes place at McCaffrey's supermarket, while an Einstein look-alike competition will match mustaches and wild gray hair at the Princeton Public Library.
Pi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library, where the winner among 7 - to 13-year-olds can take home a cool pi-hundred -LRB- That is, $314.15 -RRB-. The Historical Society of Princeton will have an Einstein birthday party. Tetsuya Miyamoto, inventor of the KENKEN puzzle, will speak at the library as well.
Here are 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize
The brainiac town residents love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are, said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009. A lot of them get super into it. Last year about 9,000 people participated, she said.
Along with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting -LRB- As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006 -RRB-.
Even more pi
Chicago is getting into the pi business too. Lots of restaurants and bakeries are offering Pi Day specials. The Illinois Science Council and Fleet Feet Sports are hosting a 3.14-mile walk/run Friday night, with discounts for anyone named Albert, Alberta or Albertina. Philly.com highlights two options for satisfying your pie cravings in the City of Brotherly Love.
Bostonians can head to Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Pi Time -LRB- 3:14 p.m. -RRB- for pi-themed activities such as Throw Pie at Your Best Friend on High-Speed Camera. 
The Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too.
Even the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art, according to the museum. If you live in the area, check out their schedule of math-inspired films and tours throughout the day.
There are plenty of online resources too, such as piday.org.
Outside of the physical classroom, Pi Day will be celebrated online through Google's virtual classroom project. David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book The Joy of Pi, is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory.
How did Pi Day become such a big thing ?
Blatner says that Pi Day has become a hit for the same reason the new Cosmos TV show is getting so much attention.
 People all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting, he said in an e-mail. We know math and science is important, we know that it's fascinating, but we often do n't know how to make it fun and interesting. Pi Day gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say Hey, it IS kind of neat !
If you agree, just wait until 3/14/15 -- or as one popular Facebook group calls it, The Only Pi Day of Our Lives. 
That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we 're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection.
So get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. That 'll be worth more than a thousand digits.

"Ken received many reminders in the mail in the weeks leading up to the first Tuesday in November, Election Day. From before the time he became a United States citizen, he looked forward to being able to choose who would represent him in the various levels of government. Shortly after taking the citizenship oath, Ken filled out a short paper form, registering him to vote and choosing a political party affiliation. Ken appreciated that choosing a specific political party didn't limit whom he could vote for, though. He was free to vote for someone of the party he registered under. He could even vote for someone of a different party. Since his vote was secret, no one would know anyway.
 
Now that he was a naturalized citizen, Ken spent many hours looking over the various voter guides that appeared in his mailbox. On the national level, Ken could vote for president, members of the Congress. On the state level, Ken could vote for state congress people and governor of the state. Locally, Ken could cast a vote for mayor, city council persons, and local school board members.
He felt a little overwhelmed by the choices. Besides getting mail about the various candidates, he saw many commercials featuring each candidate's position on various issues. There were also televised debate, which helped show what the candidates have in common and how they differ.
Ken was nervous on the day he went to vote. He went to his local polling place. A poll worker asked for Ken's name and address to verify he was registered. Ken confirmed his registration by signing next to his name. Then he was given a ballot and led to a booth where he had to make some tough choices.",B1
"Over the decades, celebrities have chosen various ways of dealing with an increasingly intrusive media. Such methods have included suing -LRB- Jacqueline Kennedy -RRB-, punching -LRB- Marlon Brando -RRB- and putting a bag over one's head -LRB- Shia LaBeouf -RRB-.
But Alec Baldwin's coping mechanism opens a new chapter in the paparazzi wars. After celebrity gossip site TMZ released footage of Baldwin shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer -LRB- with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur -RRB-, Baldwin published a bitter goodbye to public life essay in New York Magazine.
Before we permanently lose any other celebrities to their secret hideouts, it's time to consider a way to fight back against the paparazzi. In fact, Baldwin was on the cusp of discovering a new weapon a $ he just did n't realize it.
Upon first reading of Baldwin's tirade, you might have missed the solution -LRB- after all, the piece is rather long and, at times, tiresome -RRB-. But the answer is staring us in the face. In fact, it's staring all of us in the face. Every day.
These days, Baldwin said, everyone has a camera in their pocket. Not just the Ron Galellas of the world, but all of the John Q. Publics looking for a chance to shame a celebrity. This kind of world is too much for Baldwin, who is prone to losing his temper.
But if cameras are small, cheap, and ubiquitous, why not use it to your advantage ? Why not take one with you when you go in public, thus ensuring the public can always see your side of the story ? They are baiting you, Baldwin said in his farewell-to-the-world. You can tell they want to get into it with you. Some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment... Exactly. So why not catch them in the act ?
Does that sound like too much trouble ? Maybe so. But if you 're rich like Baldwin, why not hire someone to follow you around and record life as it happens ? Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.
Still sound unreasonable ? There's yet another solution that just made itself available. You can record your daily interactions with a wearable camera embedded in your glasses. If you want to show the world what really happened with that jerk of a photographer, just upload the footage from your Google Glass. As USA Today reported earlier this month, police departments are outfitting their officers with wearable cameras to protect both police and citizens against unfair accusations.
All of this might sound extreme. Why should celebrities have to go to such lengths to protect themselves ? It may be a lot of trouble, but is n't it better than being humiliated repeatedly by out-of-context outbursts ? Is n't it better than retiring from a job you love and living as a hermit for the rest of your life ? Baldwin said in his diatribe, You 're out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever. True, but not if you can show your side of the story.
It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities. Do n't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi. If you do, the celebrity gossip sites will win. It's time for a 21st century solution. It's time to fight photos with photos.

The first chart illustrates the percentage of the population who owned a smartphone from 2011 to 2016, and the second breaks the percentages down by age for 2011 and 2016.
Overall, smartphone ownership increased during the six-year period. In general, the younger people were, the more likely they were to own a smartphone. However, the most significant increases in smartphone ownership between 2011 and 2016 came from people aged 45 to 54, from 46% to 84%; from those in the 55 to 64 category, from 9% to 59%; and from those aged 65 to 74, from 5% to 50%.
The percentage of people who owned a smartphone rose steadily, starting at around 35% in 2011 and reaching about 77% by 2016. People aged 16 to 24 represented the greatest percentage of smartphone ownership in both 2011 and 2016. 75% of people aged 25 to 34 and 72% of those aged 35 to 44 owned a smartphone in 2011, rising to 88% and 86% respectively by 2016.
Although almost nobody in the 75+ age category owned a smartphone in 2011, 15% of this group owned smartphones in 2016.

"She's the daughter of a Beatle, fashion designer of everyone from Madonna to the British Olympic team, recipient of a medal from Queen Elizabeth, and counts Kate Moss among her friends.
From all appearances, Stella McCartney's life has been a charmed one -- not that she necessarily sees it that way.
Fame has followed the second child of Paul McCartney and American photographer wife Linda from the moment she was born.
And it's been both a blessing and a hindrance.
As McCartney was awarded this year's prestigious Women's Leadership Award from the Lincoln Center Corporate Fund, CNN spoke to the mother-of-four about sustainability in a notoriously unaccountable fashion industry.
Parentsinfluence
CNN: You had very famous role models -- do you think that helped you, or do you think that was actually a hurdle ?
McCartney: It certainly opened a lot of doors and certainly closed some minds. So I think there was a balance.
CNN: What do you think was the biggest inspiration you got from your mother, Linda McCartney ?
M: I learned a lot from her ethics. Both my mum and dad -LSB- former Beatle, Paul McCartney -RSB- are known to be vegetarians, world rights activists and environmentalists, and that definitely came into my place of work.
Once you have children it adds another layer of responsibility to what you 're doing. You have to be a role model to them so it makes you question your actions -- in a good way.
Biggest Challenge
CNN: What is the biggest challenge you 've encountered getting where you are now ?
M: Early on, when I wanted to go back to London and start my own fashion house, a very well thought-of executive in the industry said to me: Name one female designer that's come from Great Britain that has had any kind of global success. 
I wanted to prove him wrong. Obviously there have been great women from Britain in design, but actually there are fewer than I thought. So that was a bit of a hurdle for me.
From day one I 've never worked with leather or fur. I do n't work with PVC, and I 'm very conscious in the sourcing and manufacturing of fashion. That's a hurdle, that's a challenge, but it's a worthwhile one.
CNN: Do you feel a lot of pressure from the industry because you chose to go down the sustainable fashion road ?
M: It's been difficult, it continues to be difficult, but I 'm OK with difficult, it's what keeps me on my toes. I 've had people say to me: You 'll never sell handbags, you do n't work with leather and leather is luxury. 
To me it's the complete opposite, leather is everywhere, it's so cheap a material, it's so mass produced. Over 50 million animals a year are killed just for fashion. For me it does n't have a luxury element to it.
CNN: So you 're comfortable flipping that notion on its head, that leather is luxury ?
M: Lots of things have been around for a long time, that does n't mean they have to stick around forever. When you 're in design it's your job is to change, to push, to modernize.
The fashion industry, is not really as accountable for some reason. We 're not expected to have to answer to the fact that it's not sustainable to kill that many animals for shoes and bags. And it's not necessary ! Ninety percent of the people who come to my stores have no idea I do n't work with leather.
Being told no
CNN: You get very steely when you talk about people telling you you ca n't do something.
M: Does n't everyone, who likes being told they ca n't do something ? Anyone can do anything they want, if they really want it.
I 'm not going to pretend I did n't come from a privileged starting point. I 'll always admit that it was easier for me to question people telling me I could n't do something because I had a pretty nice place to fall back on. So maybe that afforded me a little more spark and fight.
I 'm learning as I get older, that you do n't have to try to fight everything from a man's place. I guess I got here for a reason, it was n't because I was a woman.

"Anthony wanted to get cable television for the new apartment he rented with his wife and children. He especially was interested in seeing channels from his home country. He called the local cable company to sign up. There were many options for Anthony to choose from. The basic service was the least expensive, but it didn't include any of the channels from his country. So Anthony signed up for a package that included channels from his country. However, that package didn't include cartoon channels that his children liked to see. So he added an expanded package to include cartoon channels. That still left out channels that showed certain series that his wife liked to see. So Anthony signed up for a special promotion that included a premium channel for one month free.
 
The customer service representative set an appointment to send a technician to Anthony's house in a week. The appointment wasn't for an exact time. Instead the customer service representative said the technician would come between noon and 2:00 in the afternoon. When the technician arrived, he set up a converter box and digital recorder box to the family television in the living room. The technician gave Anthony a remote and a channel guide. Anthony had to sign some papers before the technician left.
Anthony, his wife, and their children enjoyed the hundreds of channels they now had thanks to cable. One month after the technician came and installed all of the equipment, a bill arrived. The bill totaled almost 200 dollars. Anthony could not afford to pay that much on a monthly basis. He discussed it with his wife. They decided not to keep the channels from their country and the premium channels his wife enjoyed. The only extra channels Anthony kept were the cartoon channels for his kids.",B1
"Once you find an apartment you want to rent, you need to contact the landlord, the person who owns the property. Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a date to view the place you are interested in renting.
 
On that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time. Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co-signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract, with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.
If you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need.",B1
"After being told for the umpteenth time that the beer she wanted would be ""too dark and too strong for you, love - have something sweeter"", Rebecka Singerer had had enough. 
""No, I don't want a fruit beer. Women can drink whatever we want,"" she says. 
Now Singerer, a childminder, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to launch Sweden's first beer made by women. 
We Can Do It, a bottled pale ale, has just gone on sale in stores across Sweden. Its label is a take on Rosie the Riveter, the creation of a US Second World War propaganda campaign that went on to become a symbol of women's power in the workplace. 
The group's founder is Elin Carlsson, 25, who paints cars at the Volvo factory outside the city. ""We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink,"" she says. ""It's nothing to do with feminism; it's about equality - we wanted to show we can do it."" 
FemAle is up against decades of prejudice in the beer world. In an irony not lost on FemAle, Carlsberg and other big brewers have spent millions in recent years trying to sell beer to women, attempting to ""pink it and shrink it"" to appeal to perceived feminine tastes. Carlsberg's Eve and Copenhagen offerings, Foster's Radler and Coors's Animee were among lighter, flavoured and even ""bloat-resistant"" beers that failed to find a market. 
FemAle's approach is different, with women- only tastings that allow potential customers to experiment with flavours and styles of beer that they may not normally try. This education process is the way to ""get more girls into the beer world"", the group says. ""Bring your mother, sister, girlfriend, aunt and grandmother so we can all learn more about beer."" 
The idea for FemAle arose after the women kept bumping into each other at beer festivals. 
We Can Do It was the brainchild of Felicia Nordstrom, a bar worker who says she was fed up with bearded beer snobs telling her: ""What do you know about beer, sweetie?"" She approached FemAle and they teamed up with Ocean, a local independent micro-brewery. One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres. 
""This is not a beer that is aimed at women - it's our hoppiest brew,"" says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean. ""When the big breweries target women, it usually fails. This is something completely different."" 
The first batch of We Can Do It was sold out almost before it was brewed. FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them. 
We Can Do It uses three malts - Maris Otter, Amber and a Thomas Fawcett wheat malt - and the hop varieties Galaxy and Cascade. Its IBU, or bitterness level, is 65 and its alcohol content is 4.6%. 
""Women opt for a glass of wine because they don't know what beer is all about; they don't know what to order,"" says Carlsson. ""We open up new worlds to them."" 
""I used not to like stout but, back then, I only drank Pripps [a light, Swedish lager],"" says Singerer, 38. ""Guinness tastes like water to me now. There are imperial stouts that are like drinking biscotti dipped in espresso."" 
The women are part of a brewing explosion in Sweden, which is developing a passion for ""craft"" ales, bottled and on draught. The standard stor stark (large strong) lager is now ""almost extinct"" in Gothenburg, the women say, as pubs and bars replace the big brands with a choice of specialist beers. 
""All the girls are different - there is no typical woman beer-lover. Anyone can do it,"" says Emma Henriksson, 22, a group member who works in a garden equipment company. 
""Every pub wants to learn how to reach women,"" adds Singerer. ""And Elin has found the way. It's awesome. We feel so proud.""

"It was Saturday morning. Mary walked out of her house with twenty dollars in her pocket and a spirit full of optimism. She had spent the previous night in front of her television set watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found amazing things at their local thrift shops. All of these people had bought seemingly ordinary items for extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items were actually very valuable treasures. After having spent five consecutive hours watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give bargain hunting a try in hopes of finding something that would make her rich.
 
One of her favorite stories from the show was of a man who had purchased a copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking that it was a cheap replica, for only $2. He ended up discovering that the print was actually one of only 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. The man ended up making $477,650 after selling it.
As Mary walked into her local thrift shop, she tried recalling what all the people in the reality show had looked for. The most common items that people got rich from were paintings and so she headed straight to the Home Decorations aisle. Once there, she couldn't decide which looked most expensive. They actually all seemed pretty ugly to her. ""Excuse me,"" Mary said to an elderly woman walking by. ""Which painting do you think could make me richer?"" Confused, the old lady quickly pointed at one and walked away.
The painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces jumbled atop of one another. ""Definitely not my first choice,"" thought Mary. However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting. In order to see what all the buzz about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was anything special about the frame. ""Of course, it is special!"" remarked the clerk at the store. ""Its wood and age make it at least $25,000!"" Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the mail.",B1

"One of the favorite American holidays is Christmas. The holiday has a special meaning to most Americans today. It is an official government holiday celebrated on December 25. Most Americans get both Christmas Day and Christmas Eve off from their jobs so that they can spend time with their families. Many people are busy buying gifts for their loved ones in preparation for the big day. Christmas day is the time when families open presents that they have given each other. The presents are wrapped in beautiful paper, and usually include a colorful bow and a tag with a person's name on it. These presents are placed under a tree that is brought into their home and decorated with bright ornaments by the entire family.
 
When Michelle was a little girl, she loved helping her mom and dad decorate the Christmas tree. It all began by going to a Christmas tree lot, where vendors sold freshly cut trees to the public. Families can walk through the lots to pick the tree that is right for them. Michelle loved going to shop for a tree because of the sweet aroma that would come from the trees. ""I like this one, daddy,"" Michelle said. ""It's perfect,"" her dad agreed and bought the tree. It was just the right size, with full, green branches.
Once the tree was brought home, Michelle helped her mother place the tree in the right spot, and began decorating it. Her brothers and sister would help, too. This was always a great family tradition. They put a string of flickering lights around the tree, along with pretty ornaments of different kinds. Each family member got to place their own special ornament on the tree right where they wanted to. The colors blue, red, yellow, and red would blink on and off and would shine brightly, reflecting off the ornaments. As the family stood and viewed the decorated tree, all were smiling. Michelle turned to her father and said, ""Thank you, daddy.""",B1
"Chicago is known as the ""Windy City"". Some people think this is because of the breeze that blows almost constantly. The city is located in the state of Illinois on the shore of one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan, which is the fifth largest freshwater body in the world. Chicago may also be called the windy city because of the wind tunnel effect created in downtown by many tall buildings.
 
Skyscrapers are an important part of Chicago's history. The first skyscraper in the U.S. was built in the city in 1884. At only 10 stories, it was impressive for its time. The skycraper was eventually demolished. Chicago is the home of other famous firsts. It was the birthplace of the refrigerated rail car, mail-order catalogs, the car radio, the TV remote control, the first Ferris wheel, the first steel rail road, the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Chicago is also the home to the first blood bank and the first drive-in bank. It is also the home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the oldest public zoo in the U.S. Maybe the windy city should be called the city of firsts.
Chicago is the third most populous city in the U.S., after New York City and Los Angeles. A little more than two and a half million people live in the city that has more than 100 neighborhoods. President Barack Obama used to live in Chicago.
Nearly 40 million people visit Chicago every year. Many of them visit the Willis Tower. Formally known as the Sears Tower, it is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. It takes only a minute to get up to the 103rd floor Skydeck thanks to some of the fastest elevators in the world. From the Skydeck visitors can see four states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.",B1
"Driving in the U.S. can be confusing not just because of all the rules and laws that drivers must follow, but also because of driving customs. Many people in the U.S. are really dependent on their cars to get to work and school. In fact most American workers spend an hour driving to work each day. In order to drive in the U.S., you have to go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles first, and take a written test to get your learner's permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has free booklets you can go and get to study for your learner's permit. You can also access the information online and even take a practice written exam. To prepare for the road test, you can have a friend teach you to drive or pay to take classes at a driving school. You cannot, however, practice driving by yourself. If you are caught driving with only a learner's permit, you can get into trouble with the law.
 
Once you get your driver's license in one state, you can use it to drive in all of the United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs posted along the road indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. Generally you can drive faster on a highway than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to detect your speed. If they detect you are speeding or driving over the speed limit, police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the fines are more than $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep cars in their lanes. They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that it is against the law to pass another car here.to pass another car here.

"Many American basketball fans would argue that Michael Jordan is by far the greatest player ever to play in the National Basketball Association. The professional basketball league has existed since 1947, and there have been many individual players that have excelled in the game. Players such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Jerry West had made their mark in the league long before Jordan ever played the game.
 
To be sure, Jordan had a great impact on the game primarily during his playing years with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the team to six championship finals, winning all six during the 1990s. His legend is firmly cemented into the history of the great city, and many fans feel he has no equal. It is hard to argue against Jordan in light of his success in all the titles he achieved, but basketball is a team sport, and winning a championship needs a team effort. There have been countless superstars who played in the league that did not have good teammates, and never won a title. Chamberlain falls into that category.
Chamberlain did win two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game ever dominated it the way he did. He holds several league records, one of which is that he is the only player ever to score 100 points in a single game. However, when Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as it was in the 90s. During the 90s, the league enjoyed a much greater popularity among American viewers, and much of this can be attributed to the greatness of Michael Jordan. Jordan brought a style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He garnered many individual awards during his career. He played his last few seasons as a member of the Washington Bullets.",B1
"In January I spent three weeks volunteering as an English teacher in my town. I've been thinking about becoming an English teacher for a while so it was a good opportunity to see what it's like. The students had all just arrived to start a new life in the UK and they had a range of levels from beginner to intermediate. They came from a variety of countries and had very different backgrounds and experiences.
For me, the most important thing was the relationship with the students. I was nervous at first and did not feel confident about speaking in front of people. However, I found it easy to build good relationships with the students as a class and as individuals and I soon relaxed with them. It was a challenge to encourage the lower-level students to speak in English, but at least they understood a lot more at the end of the course.
At first, planning lessons took a really long time and I was not happy with the results. Classes seemed to be too difficult for some students and too easy for others, who finished quickly and got bored. I found it was better to teach without a course book, adapting materials I found online to suit their needs. I learned to take extra activities for students who finished early and that was much better.
I still need to continue improving my lesson planning. I would like more ideas for teaching mixed-ability groups and I want to plan the whole course better next time. That way students have a focus for each lesson and a sense of progress and of what they've covered. I'm also going to put more confident students with beginners when they work in pairs so conversation activities give everyone more chance to speak and students can help each other.
Overall, it was a really positive experience and I learned a lot. I've decided that I would like to become an English teacher in the future.",B1
"There was a march through the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. The march was sponsored by a coalition of local organizations and agencies. The purpose of the march was to bring awareness to the violence in the community. Many people have been killed because of gun violence and other crimes.
 
The march began at 9 a.m. on a busy corner. Many parents brought their children to the march. The crowd began to walk down the neighborhood sidewalks. Occasionally the crowd would stop, and an organizer using a bullhorn would tell the story of a person who was killed. After the organizer told the story, there would be a prayer followed by a moment of silence. There were relatives of people who had been killed participating in the march. Some of these relatives would leave lit candles, balloons, or flowers in remembrance of the persons who died. One woman who died was found in the lake of Hollenbeck Park. Police suspect that her boyfriend killed her. She had a baby daughter. Her ex-husband participated in the march and asked that organizers include her in their prayers.
The march continued for 20 blocks, and ended at Wabash Park. While the march was somber, the mood inside the park was more celebratory. Different organizations had booths with information about local programs. There was a craft table for kids to draw picture about the kind of neighborhood they wanted to live in. Different bands played between speakers offering solutions to the neighborhood's problems.
On the same day there was another march at a nearby housing project. In the spring, four houses were firebombed. Police suspect the attacks were racially motivated. Organizers planned to hold the march again next year. They really hoped though that conditions in the neighborhood would improve so they wouldn't have to march, though.",B1
"Clay Cockrell is sitting in his office at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower. In front of the tower is Central Park, where Cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions. 
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a confidant and counsellor to some of New York's wealthiest people. 
""I shifted towards it naturally,"" he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy. ""Many of the extremely wealthy - the 1% of the 1% - feel that their problems are really not problems. But they are. A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues."" 
So, what issues are America's 1% struggling with? ""There is guilt over being rich in the first place,"" he said. ""There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And, then, there is the isolation - being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely."" It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich ""are different from you and me"". 
Counsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign. 
""The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,"" said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich ""feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed"". 
""Sometimes, I am shocked by things that people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders."" 
""It's really isolating to have a lot of money. People's reactions to you can be scary,"" said Barbara Nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. ""We are all taught not to talk about money. It's not polite to talk about money. Ironically, it's harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It's much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broke. Things are hard.' You can't say 'I have a ton of money.' You have to keep a lot of your life private."" 
As a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems. 
The growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016. 
In the US, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined. 
The number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets - excluding the value of their primary home - increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more. 
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation ""has gotten worse for the wealthy"", Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. 
""Someone else who is also a billionaire - they don't want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,"" said Cockrell. ""As the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated."" 
These are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College's Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America's 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America's richest households - 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can't buy happiness. 
""Wealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,"" confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. ""We talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,"" said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. 
""People say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,"" she said. ""Wealth is still one of our last taboos."" 
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. 
""I don't think it's healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don't have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,"" he said. ""Your problems are legitimate.""

"he was the best tennis player in Japan.
 And Roger Federer. Still now, even though I love to see him play I think he is really the champion of tennis history. 
` Project 45 '
Nishikori's rise saw a swell of optimism that he could be a pioneer for tennis, hence the Project 45hype as he edged towards usurping Matsuoka's ranking.
 Project 45 was no pressure for me -- I was just playing tennis for my hobby, he said.
 My first goal after turning pro was to get into the top 100 and after to be 45. It was one of my goals to be number one tennis player in Japan, and now I am ranked No. 11 in the world.
 To get to the top 10 is my next goal. It's not going to be easy to get there -- hopefully this year -- but I am getting close. 
Rock star status
Like Matsuoka, Nishikori has come to understand what being Japan's sole representative inside the top 120 means -- fame and adoration.
Much like Andy Murray who has had to carry the hopes of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, Nishikori has the same weight of responsibility, but answers to double the amount of people.
 I go back to Japan about three or four times a year, he explained. I get to go back to my home town and, yes, people do recognize me on the streets.
 It's not easy sometimes; you do n't get to relax but at the same time I still try to enjoy the moment. Not many people can feel that way -- I love to stay in Japan, I really enjoy it when I go back. 
Not for a second does he begrudge the accoutrements that his success in the game has delivered. He's just a boy made good from Shimane acting out his hobby on the global stage.
 For me, playing tennis was always my hobby, I am a lucky guy, he said.
 It was something I loved. It is something that can make you mad or crazy sometimes but it is something you love and not many guys can do your job.
 I try to enjoy this moment and this life -- it is not going to be a long time, 10 to 20 years, so I 'm going to work hard.

"Laura was confused. She came to the United States a year ago. She didn't understand the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day. She knew that both holidays had to do with remembering and honoring people who had fought in wars for the United States. She also knew that both days were national holidays. On both days banks, schools and the post offices were closed; on both holidays, stores offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American Flag, and sometimes there were even fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days the President of the United States made a speech and visited a cemetery laying a wreath on the grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the mailman Brian what the difference was. She figured he would know since he had both days off from work.
 
The next day when Brian was dropping off Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that Memorial Day is usually observed on the last Monday of May. This meant that it could be on a different date every year. Memorial day is a day for remembering and honoring those in the military who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memorial Day. Veterans day is a day set aside to thank and honor all people who served in the United States military. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those that are still alive. Brian told Laura that the date for Veterans Day never changes. It is always held on November 11, which was the date when World War I ended in 1918.",B1
"A bridal shower is a party when a woman who is about to get married is ""showered"" with gifts and well wishes. A bride-to-be will often register at one or several department stores and create a list of things she would like people to give her as presents. This makes it easy for guests of both the bridal shower and the wedding itself to know what kind of things the bride wants. A registry also makes sure that there are no duplicate presents. A bride may want a blender, but she sure doesn't want to receive three and have to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and microwave ovens. Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they help the new couple ""spice up"" their married life. Others find these types of presents embarrassing.
 
While many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home. It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall. Sometimes snacks and desserts are served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally bridal showers were women only affairs. However, more and more showers are no co-ed, with men and women. Traditionally men are not invited to bridal showers but now more showers include men and the groom-to-be. Like many parties in the U.S., there would be no dancing at the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some bridal showers even have games.",B1

I am not a very sporty person. There aren't too many sports that I like doing. I have tried playing
tennis in a club but I was so bad at it that nobody wanted to play with me. So I gave it up. Ball games
are not my world. There is one activity, however, which I really enjoy, and that is cycling. Every day
when I get home from work I take my bike from the garage and off I go. I usually cycle for about an
hour except when it rains. I avoid the busy streets of my town and I especially enjoy cycling along
forest paths. As for my diet, I am not a very healthy eater and I must admit that I eat a very big

find this really enjoyable even when it rains. It's amazing how fast you can eat lunch if you want to
have some extra time for something else. Then, two weeks ago I joined a gym. The first time was a
nightmare but gradually it became easier and I hope I can manage to go at least twice a week in the
future. If I can keep this schedule, I think I've done a lot for my health.

"The Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal (pronounced /(U+02CC)t(U+0251)(U+02D0)d(U+0292) m(U+0259)'h(U+0251)(U+02D0)l/) is a famous mausoleum next to the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. A mausoleum is a building where people bury the dead. The name Taj Mahal means 'the crown of palaces'.
1. 
The most famous part of the Taj Mahal is the large white dome in the centre. It is 35 metres high and is surrounded by four smaller domes. The rooms inside the building are decorated with beautiful archways and precious stones in the walls. The buildings are surrounded by gardens with pathways, pools, fountains and green gardens.
2.
The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and finished in 1653. It was built with materials from all over India and Asia, but the main material is white marble. Historians believe that the materials were transported by over 1,000 elephants for the construction.
3.
The emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a burial place for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. According to legend, he wanted to build another Taj Mahal in black on the other side of the river, but this never happened. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, many parts of the Taj Mahal were damaged by British soldiers, who took some of the precious stones from its walls. Over the years, the Taj Mahal has suffered from environmental damage, and there have been many government attempts to conserve its beauty.
4.
The Taj Mahal is one of India's most famous landmarks. There are millions of visitors to the mausoleum every year. The Taj Mahal is almost always included in lists of famous buildings to visit and is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

"Hurricane Bertha -- the first hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic season -- increased in strength Monday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.
A satellite picture from 5:45 a.m. ET Monday shows Hurricane Bertha over the Atlantic.
While Bertha's power may fluctuate over the next day, it is expected to begin gradually weakening by Wednesday, the center's 11 p.m. ET advisory said.
Bertha's became a major -- or Category 3 -- hurricane Monday afternoon. A Category 3 has wind speeds of 111 to 130 mph.
As of 11 p.m. ET, Bertha was 695 miles -LRB- 1,115 km -RRB- east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and about 1,085 miles -LRB- 1,745 km -RRB- southeast of Bermuda. The eye was moving toward the west-northwest at about 12 mph. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 120 mph -LRB- 195 km/hr -RRB-, up from the 115 mph mentioned in a 5 p.m. advisory.
The hurricane is expected to turn to the northwest and decrease its forward speed in the next 24 to 48 hours, the center said.
There is a very small chance Bertha will make landfall in the United States. Bermuda could be affected by the hurricane this weekend. See Bertha's projected path 
 It is still way too soon to determine whether or not Bertha will affect Bermuda, the center said.
The storm formed Thursday in the far eastern Atlantic, off the coast of Africa, near the southern Cape Verde Islands. It strengthened into a hurricane early Monday. Learn more about hurricanes

American track and field athlete, James ""Jesse"" Owens, had a different idea.

During one track meet in 1935, Owens set three world records, and tied another, in what has been called ""the greatest 45 minutes ever in sports."" Although Owens found great success in his athletic career, he grew up during a time in America when black people were still highly discriminated against. Segregation laws were still in effect in many parts of the country, and Owens felt this prejudice directly. He was not able to stay in the same hotel rooms as his white teammates, nor was he allowed to eat at the same restaurants. Ironically, Owens was treated better during his time at the 36th Olympics in Germany.
During the games, Hitler became annoyed that Owens was winning so many gold medals. Owens was proving Hitler's racist claims and rhetoric as untrue. Hitler didn't like it. Owens ended up winning four gold medals at these games. Hitler refused to shake his hand. One of the defining moments of the games is when Owens was befriended by German athlete Luz Long. Owens cherished his friendship with Long, especially because he knew that Long could fall out of favor with Hitler's brutal regime.
Many German fans shook Owen's hands, even though Hitler did not, but when Owens returned to the United States, he found not much had changed in there.",B1
"One of the world's greatest tragedies was the sinking of the luxury liner Titanic. Although it was a British ship, many Americans were on board during that terrible night of April 15, 1912. The ship was on its maiden voyage on that night when it struck an iceberg in the deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was in route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it hit the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever built to that date, and was thought to be unsinkable.
 
The ship's passengers varied from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when they were launched, causing more loss of life.
Most of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required ""women and children first,"" when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has been documented in film and literature over the years.",B1
"Apples don't grow in New York City, so that's not why it is called the Big Apple. There are many legends about how the city that never sleeps got its name. One story says that a famous brothel owner named Eve gave the city its name. Another version of history claims the name has its roots in show business with performers calling New York the ""Big Apple"" since it was the best place to get noticed. There is one legend that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.
 
The term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were called ""apples"" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call the big prize the big apple. In fact, the ""big apple"" soon was used to mean any big city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, ""The Big Apple"" was not just a nickname for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing. New York City was the heart of the jazz music scene in the 1930's and 1940s. In Harlem, uptown Manhattan, there was a club called ""The Big Apple"". There was also a 1938 short film of the same name featuring black jazz musicians and dancers.
In the 1970s, the city tourism agency began using the term the ""Big Apple"" on purpose. There is even a street corner in Manhattan called ""Big Apple Corner"". One New York City baseball team, the New York Mets, have a big red apple that pops out whenever the Mets hit a home run in their stadium Citifield. While the origins of the ""Big Apple"" nickname are unclear, it seems to be here to stay.",B1
"Molly Haskell will always have brotherly love for Ellen Hampton. After all, Hampton was once named John Cheves Haskell Jr. and used to be Haskell's brother.
Until 2005, Hampton lived as John -- or, as his family called him, Chevey. That year, he told his sister he had been living with gender dysphoria, which the American Psychiatric Association defines as a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender. 
 This was my 59-year-old brother, Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview. He had been this little boy, and all my memories had been of a male. It makes you revisit your whole past. 
Haskell details the experience with a critical but compassionate eye in her latest book, My Brother My Sister. 
At the time of the announcement, Chevey was married to a woman, Eleanor, and a loving stepdad to their two children.
Hampton, now divorced, lives as a heterosexual female after gender reassignment and facial reconstruction surgeries, hormone therapy and a wardrobe overhaul.
Haskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
CNN: You 've obviously come to terms with Ellen's decision. What did it take on your part ?
Haskell: First of all, I realized very soon that it's very overwhelming. I knew I could never say do n't do this.My brother would have never hurt anyone, so it really told me how powerful the feeling was. Watching her go through it and evolve -- not only was she radiantly happy, but she was completely upfront with it. Seeing how she handled it -- she would talk about it if people wanted to -- showed me this was meant to be.
CNN: Yet, you do candidly write about having unexpected anxiety about the news.
Haskell: I was afraid for her. I was flabbergasted that this was going on. There was shock and apprehension. I had been all for more diversity, and challenging binary roles for male and female behavior, but it did n't somehow include my brother changing sexes.
The one thing is that we are born male or female, and we need those boundaries to rub up against. I think one interesting thing a feminist said to me is that I seem to embrace these binary principles in the book. I do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female; we need these dichotomies, like good and evil. We make these divides to keep our footing in the world.
The sex we 're born is not immutable, and that is very hard to grasp. You ca n't really call her decision a choice. It's too painful, too perilous, it has to be an urge that we do n't even have a word for.
CNN: What was your takeaway from Ellen's journey ?
Haskell: I think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all. For example, the director of The Matrix Larry Wachowski, who is now Lana Wachowski, has this wild red hair. My sister is so not like that. This book is an attempt to unweird the whole subject. I think it's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal, but I do think we have to remember that it's not that many people.
So much changes, but so much does n't change. You can take hormones to change this, have surgery to change that, but you ca n't change the voice, the hair, the love -- there is a core of self that does n't change.
CNN: How has it been different to have a sister rather than a brother ?
Haskell: It's wonderful. It's like I 've gotten two for the price of one. We have differences -- it takes so long for her to get dressed ! We 're just much closer than we 've ever been. It's hard to say the change has n't made her happier.
At first I thought I 'm really losing a brother. It was like a grief; a death. But, her happiness is crucial. She's more open, more gregarious. I think my mother would 've been very, very upset but, in a funny way, Ellen is the kind of person my mother wanted Chevey to be.
CNN: How was it different at age 59 than it might have been earlier ?
Haskell: I think the reason she did n't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance. Why is so much of this happening now ? Because it can. There is a word for it and there are people doing it. This submerged desire finally had a means of being liberated.
CNN: Having Ellen in your life took some adjusting, even in small areas like the correct language, right ?
Haskell: The first time we went out in public, I was very self-conscious and nervous. We went to dinner at an upscale restaurant and the waiter asked how we liked our food. I said, Mine is good, but his is fabulous. She -LRB- Ellen -RRB- smirked and I smirked.
I would often call her Chevey by mistake when it was just the two of us. And on the phone, the voice is a huge thing that is not improvable. There is no good surgery. When she gets on the phone, I would see her as Chevey, my brother.
Recently, though, I 've stopped doing that. It's automatically Ellen.
CNN: Ellen initially did n't want you to write the book, but then she changed her mind. Why ?
Haskell: She wished she had this book when she was struggling with it. I wanted it to be her book as much as my book. I think of it as a partnership.

"With the rollout of HealthCare.gov -- the portal for enrollment in the new Obamacare health care exchanges -- getting hammered by critics and users, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for an exclusive interview.
Here are Gupta's takeaways from the interview:
1. Full speed ahead
I was surprised to learn just how extensive the concerns were before the October 1 rollout. Congressional investigators claim that just weeks before the planned rollout, more than two-thirds of insurers had concerns about the system being viable by October 1. Just days before the launch, the website crashed while being tested with just a few hundred people logging in, according to the Washington Post.
Despite all that, the White House decided to move forward. When I pressed Sebelius on this point, she said, We moved forward because millions of people have been waiting for health care insurance, and they did n't want to delay any longer.
Sebelius on the spot over Obamacare rollout
She made that point a few times: A few weeks wo n't make that much of a difference given that open enrollment lasts until the end of March, and that millions more people could have health insurance by that time.
2. Obama did n't know ?
According to Sebelius, President Barack Obama was not aware of any significant problems until a couple days after the website had been launched.
The Affordable Care Act is touted as a signature achievement for the Obama administration, and it surprised me that the President was not being kept up to speed -- according to Sebelius -- on the concerns around the rollout.
Sebelius: Obamacare website rollout problems blindsided President
3. A-Team late to arrive
Sebelius said in order to get the website running smoothly, she has asked that contractors bring in their best and brightest, their A-Team. I was surprised that the A-Team had n't been assembled earlier, given the magnitude of the ACA, and the challenge of setting up the website.
When I pressed the Secretary on this point, she just said that she wants new eyes and ears, and to put all hands on deck, working toward a solution as quickly as possible.
4. Open to delaying fines ?
Sebelius did not back down on the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine.
I asked how it was possible that people could face a fine, if they had tried to sign up and were unsuccessful. At that point, it seems she might have left the window open to a delay, saying only: I do n't think that that really is the question right now. 
 The issue is will people be able to sign up for affordable health care in the six-month open enrollment period ? And I think the answer is absolutely yes. 
Whether or not this issue comes up again is unclear. For now, the Secretary said the individual mandate is here to stay.
Administration to kick off effort to encourage enrollment
5. Falling on her sword ?
Finally, I asked her about the calls for her resignation. Over the past few days, her friend, Sen. Pat Roberts, as well as 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, have raised the possibility.
While not giving a decisive no, Sebelius again reinforced the mission of this task, saying it was the most important job she has ever had. She also reinforced that she served at the pleasure of the President.

"The original World Trade Center opened in New York City in 1973. The most famous part of the complex of buildings was the Twin Towers. They were named because there were almost exactly the same. The only difference is that one had a tall antenna on the top.
 
When they were built, the 1,368-foot tall buildings were the tallest in the world. Such tall buildings needed a way for people to travel in them. The towers had 95 elevators in total. Visitors used to travel to the 107th and 110th floors, where there were observation decks from which one could see the entire city and New Jersey. Inside there were offices, shops, a hotel, and on the top floor of one of the towers there was a restaurant called ""Windows on the World"". The restaurant even hosted a salsa night on Thursdays. A number of subway lines ran underneath the towers. The World Trade Center Complex, with a total of seven buildings, was so large that it had its own zip code. In 1974 a French man walked a tightrope between the twin towers.
The World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The skyline and spirit of New York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. At first the top floors of the buildings were in flames. Soon they came tumbling down, covering lower Manhattan in hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, The World Trade Center is rebuilding. There is a new tower, called the Freedom Tower. There is also a memorial and museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack.",B1
"The Beatles are an English group of musicians from Liverpool, England. It took America by storm with their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on primetime television. The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in February, 1964, introducing the band to the American people. In the months to follow, the group became the biggest Rock 'N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.
 
The group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.
The Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music. Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.
There was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance. Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the ""Mop Tops"" because of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50 plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.",B1
"In Los Angeles, places associated with death are often popular. One such popular place is the Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner. When someone dies and the cause of death is undetermined or suspicious, the body is brought here for examination. It is the coroner's job to determine the time, cause, and manner of death. Sometimes the coroner will have to perform an autopsy, which is like an operation on a dead body to try to figure out how the person died. One of the reasons the L.A. Coroner's Office is so popular is because of the number of famous people who have been examined there. Some of those people include Marilyn Monroe, Robert F. Kennedy, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston.
 
The Los Angeles Coroner's Office is so popular that there is even a gift shop where visitors can buy items like shirts, caps, and mugs with the Coroner's logo on them. One tee-shirt people can buy even says, ""Our bodies of work speak for themselves"". They even sell beach towels with body outlines. The store is open five days a week. They also have a website and a paper catalog for those who are not close enough to visit. The Coroner's Office claims the purpose of the store is to tell people how fragile life is and to create awareness and responsibility toward one's actions. Some people feel that having a store in the same place where dead people are is disrespectful.
There have been a number of television shows about the L.A. Coroner's Office. Some of these are reality TV shows featuring what workers really do there. An example is called ""Death Detectives"". Other shows are fictional like ""Quincy M.E."" The M.E. stands for medical examiner, the person who performs the autopsies.",B1
"Boston is the capital of Massachusetts. It is the largest city in the New England state and is rich with history. This is why over 12 million people visit the city every year. It is a very old city, founded in 1630 by English colonists fleeing religious persecution. The American Revolution, when colonists, known as patriots, fought for their independence from the British, began in Boston with the Battle of Lexington. Other key events in the revolution occurred in the city. One was the Boston Massacre, when British troops fired upon protesters, killing five. The Boston Tea Party, when colonists dumped an entire shipment of British tea into the harbor to protest taxes, was not a party at all. Paul Revere's ""midnight ride"", where he warned colonists of British troops approaching, also happened in Boston. Many of these sites can be accessed by taking a walk down the ""Freedom Trail"", a red line of bricks embedded in the ground through the city.
Boston is also a city of notable firsts. America's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635. Boston Common, where British troops camped during the American Revolution and where early colonists hanged people, is the oldest public park in the United States. Boston is also home to the oldest subway system in the United States.
Like many cities in the United States, immigrants played a large role in its development. Irish immigrants who settled in Boston, for example, played a large role in both local and national politics. Boston also has a large and active Puerto Rican community and Italian community. President John F. Kennedy and his family have ties to Boston.
Boston is also well known for many colleges and universities that surround it. Some of the most famous are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from around the world.",B1

Transcript
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
NASA ANNOUNCER: Two... one... booster ignition... and the final liftoff of Discovery.
CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Of course, we will have more on that for you in today's show, but we are getting off the ground in northern Africa. My name is Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now !
First Up: Unrest in Libya
AZUZ: There are roughly 6,000 Americans in Libya, and the U.S. government is trying to get them out. A ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of U.S. citizens from Libya to Malta was held up for a while yesterday. U.S. officials said everyone onboard was safe. They said the delay was because of the weather.
Meanwhile, Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is blaming the violence in his country on young people. He says they 're taking some sort of pills and being manipulated by the al Qaeda terrorist group. But during a speech earlier this week, President Obama said what's going on in that part of the world has nothing to do with outside influences.
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So let me be clear. The change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region. This change does n't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power. It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life.
Political Unrest
AZUZ: Looking around that region, starting next door to Libya in Algeria. The country has lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency, and what that means is that people there have greater freedom of speech and assembly now. Moving south to Cameroon, where protesters are demanding that the country's president step down. He's been in power for nearly 30 years and is running for re-election this year. Finally, Yemen, where eight lawmakers resigned to protest violence against people who are demonstrating against the government. One of the lawmakers said, I resigned because there's been no respect by the government for human rights. 
Is This Legit ?
JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit ? The space shuttle Discovery is named after sailing ships. This one's true ! The shuttle is named after two ships that explored the world.
Final Mission
AZUZ: The space shuttle Discovery has made more trips into space than any other craft. All together, the shuttle's spent almost a full year in orbit around the Earth. Yesterday, Discovery set out on its 39th and last mission, delivering equipment to the international space station. This was Discovery's first launch, back in 1984. And these launches are n't cheap. NASA estimates that every time a shuttle takes off, it costs nearly half a billion dollars. After Discovery's current mission, there are just two launches left for the space shuttle program.
Budget Battle
AZUZ: We 've been reporting on this controversial budget bill in Wisconsin. You can check our transcript archives for details on that. Now, it was scheduled to come up for a vote yesterday, but only in the State House of Representatives. Things are not moving forward in the Wisconsin Senate. And that's because Democratic senators have left the state in an effort to try to block any vote on the bill. You can get the latest details on this situation at CNN.com.
TeachersLounge
AZUZ: Our latest TeachersLounge blog asks for your opinions about a controversial budget decision in Detroit. The city's planning to close half of its public schools. And teachers, we want to hear your thoughts on this. Enter the TeachersLounge from our home page: CNNStudentNews.com !
Shoutout
TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Bozic's world geography class at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas ! Willie O'Ree was the first African-American to play in what sports league ? Was it the: A -RRB- MLB, B -RRB- NBA, C -RRB- NFL or D -RRB- NHL ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Willie O'Ree made his debut in the National Hockey League in 1958. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout !
Diversity in Hockey
AZUZ: Willie O'Ree paved the way for other African-Americans to hit the NHL ice. As we continue our commemoration of Black History Month, we 're taking a look at the diversity on the Atlanta Thrashersroster. Richelle Carey sat down with the team's four African-Americans to talk about life as a minority pro hockey player.
-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-
RICHELLE CAREY, HLN ANCHOR: I want each one of you to tell me what you like about hockey. Sell me on hockey ! Sell me !
EVANDER KANE, THRASHERS LEFT WINGER: Hockey is the fastest, most physical sport there is.
JOHNNY ODUYA, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: The teamwork, too. I would say a total package sport.
ANTHONY STEWART, THRASHERS RIGHT WINGER: I just like skating fast, ever since I was three.
DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: I guess it's just something about being on the ice that I enjoy. It's just me being out there, having fun and enjoying the people around me.
CAREY: What's the biggest misconception or false assumption that people make about you ?
BYFUGLIEN: This guy ca n't stand on skates.
ODUYA: Maybe in Atlanta, you tell people that you 're a hockey player and they do n't believe you.
CAREY: What do you think ?
ODUYA: I do n't know. Maybe basketball or baseball, I have no idea.
CAREY: Who here knew that they were going to be a professional hockey player ? Anybody here know that ?
STEWART: I knew probably when I was in grade one. We had an assignment to say what you wanted to be when you grew up. And I said, Hockey player, and she said, Pick something else. And I said, No, I 'm going to be a hockey player, and I stuck with it.
CAREY: Did anybody try to steer you to something different, because you do n't look out on the ice that often and see people of color ? Did someone say this is n't the right fit for you ?
KANE: No, I think, honestly, it was almost the opposite. My dad really instilled that drive in me to battle through that kind of stuff, battle through adversity, and that's what made me so successful.
CAREY: Anybody else feel that they were steered in a different direction for racial reasons at all ?
STEWART: I grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and, you know, a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that. I 'd go play a little bit of basketball, but after an hour I 'd get bored of it, so I 'd say, I have to go play hockey now. And they would go, Uh, naw, you 're not going to make it in hockey, so you might as well play basketball or something like that. But I had some support from my parents. That helped me a lot. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped get me to where I am today.
CAREY: We always hear about hockey as, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. And often, maybe, that's why minority kids do n't get into it. Explain, why is it so expensive ?
STEWART: I think when you have to pay $500 for a pair of skates as opposed to a $20 basketball or $50 pair of soccer shoes, it makes a lot more sense to play those sports. But there's a lot of community initiatives right now in the NHL helping urban kids. And with the Hockey Is For Everyone program that's helping not so fortunate kids play, they 're making good strides.
-LRB- END VIDEO -RRB-
Before We Go
AZUZ: Finally today, with the space shuttle program winding down, we 're looking back at the 132 missions that have come before. And just for fun, we 're gon na do it in 132 seconds. Start the countdown.

"No one ever out-smiled Magic Johnson. Ever since he was a young man, Johnson has been known for his great attitude toward life. It just happens that Johnson is also one of the greatest basketball players to ever play in the National Basketball Association. Johnson played his entire career for the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers are the best franchise in the NBA over the past 40 years, having won more championships than any other teams.
 
During the 1980s, the Lakers were known as ""Showtime"" because of the team's high-paced, and high-scoring style of play. Much of this style can be attributed to the charismatic Johnson. His style developed at an early age when he was playing basketball in his home state of Michigan. He attended Michigan State University, and led its team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title in 1979.
He was taken by the Lakers as their first pick in the college draft, and he never left. Johnson played for the Lakers from 1980 through 1991, and then played for a few games in 1996. During the 80s, he led the Lakers to eight championship appearances, and won five. No other team had dominated the game in a single decade since the Boston Celtics in the 60s. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal in basketball, and won the Most Valuable Player Awards multiple times, but his most endearing quality remained as one of the nicest and well-liked player in the game.
Today Johnson still calls Los Angeles his home. He has transitioned from basketball player to coach, to team owner, and businessman. He owns a successful franchise of movie theaters called the Magic Johnson Theaters. Johnson was also part of the investment group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in 2012. He is married, and has two sons and a daughter.",B1
"The parenting styles of parents in the United States are often criticized. One type of parenting that is criticized is a helicopter parent. This kind of parents hover over their children like helicopters, which means these parents are always on top of their children.
 
While being an aware and involved parent is not a bad thing, helicopter parents take it to the extreme. The actions of helicopter parents actually hurt children, by not teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, a helicopter parents would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of college is learning to be responsible and learning to manage your own time. Helicopter parents are also overly worried about their kids getting hurt. This means helicopter parents hold back their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up means your kid has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned. Instead, the kids of helicopter parents can grow up to be overly needy, dependent adults. Some people blame the rise of helicopter parenting on the rise of cell phones. Mobile phones make it easier for parents to track their kids all the time.
The opposite of the helicopter mom is the free-range mom. The free-range mom follows a slow parenting style, meaning she lets her kids explore the world at their own pace with little direction. The name free-range comes from the idea that kids should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys.",B1
"When a movie is going to premiere, the theater will usually show the film during a midnight screening. Anthony Baker and his girlfriend Linda Moore love going to see new movies at midnight. A lot of people usually show up early to make line. Anthony likes going to stand in line and talk to different people that are in the line. Anthony told Linda about the new movie that was coming out. Linda went online to buy the tickets. She wanted to make sure that they would get tickets.
 
Linda got an email from the theater. It said that she could pick up the tickets at the theater. Anthony took Linda out to eat before they went to the theater to wait in line. Anthony was excited because the movie they were going to see was the sequel to one of Anthony's favorite movies. When they got to the theater, Anthony and Linda went to the back of the line and started talking to the people in the back. They all seemed friendly, and some of them actually knew Anthony and Linda.
After about an hour of waiting in line, the theater started letting people in. Anthony hugged Linda and started jumping up and down. Linda loved going to the theater with Anthony. He seemed like a little kid when he was there. It always put a smile on Linda's face. When they got inside, Anthony and Linda found their seats. They noticed everyone in the theater started singing a song that came out in the first movie, so Anthony got up and started clapping and singing along. Linda looked up at Anthony and thought to herself, ""It's a whole different experience seeing a midnight screening.",B1
"Not all kids' birthday parties in the U.S. are created equal. Sometimes it seems like the birthday parties are about showing off and entertaining the parents of kids in addition to children.
 
Most children's birthday parties are held in the home of the birthday boy or girl. It used to be that children's parties were just for children. Parents would drop their kids off and come back when the party was over to bring them home. Now it is more common for the parents of guests to stay for the party as well. This gives the adults time and space to socialize while the kids play games. Kids and adults don't always have the same tastes in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday party, there is usually fancier food for the adults like cheese, crackers, and fruit platters. Meanwhile the kids eat hot dogs and potato chips. While the children drink punch, juice, or soda, the parents may be sipping cocktails, beer, or wine.
Entertainment for a party of mixed adults and children also goes beyond the usual clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and the adults will dance. Party games are not just for the kids, either. While the children play traditional games like pin the tail on the donkey, the adults may play casino-type games like blackjack or poker.
Not everyone likes this trend of adults and children partying together. Some feel that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting drunk in front of the kids. Others worry about kids getting abused by adults they don't know. For others, it is just about allowing a kid to have their special day. There is also a concern that these mixed parties encourage a sense of competition among parents in a community.",B1
"For the past month Mark King had been receiving flyers in the mail about a new superstore that was opening up in his neighborhood. The flyers confused him. He had never heard the term superstore before. Later on, he found out that a superstore is a large retail store that sells a variety of products, usually at discount prices. Sometimes superstores are also called big box stores. Many times they are chain stores owned by one company.
 
The flyers all had different messages about the superstore opening. One set of flyers invited him and others to apply for jobs at the store. The jobs paid well and even offered some benefits. Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew many people were looking for work. Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on opening day. The store had many bargains for common items like paper towels, but also for big screen televisions. Mark thought this too was a good thing. It seemed like a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from one store to another. It would save time and money. Superstores could sell groceries and clothes under one roof.
Another set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore though. Some local residents were organizing a protest of the superstore. The flyers said that the superstore was bad for the community because it threatened the business of smaller stores in the area. Mark thought about Mr. Hernandez who owned a small grocery store down the block. That was where Mark bought staple food items like eggs and milk. He didn't want Mr. Hernandez's store to be closed, but he also wanted to save money.",B1
"Section 8 is also called the housing choice voucher program. Very poor families, the elderly, and disabled people can get up to about 2,000 dollars a month to help pay rent in single-family homes and apartments. Families who qualify do not get a completely free ride though. In order to qualify, you must be able to pay about 30 percent of the rent yourself. The rest of the rent is paid directly by the government to a landlord. Not all landlords accept Section 8. If you qualify for Section 8, it is your responsibility to find a landlord who accepts the program.
 
Eligibility for the program depends on your annual income and how many people are in your family. To qualify you have to be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident of the U.S. If you are undocumented or have a tourist visa, you cannot apply for this program. Like with all public housing programs, you will have to fill out an application to see if you qualify. On the application you will have to say how much money you make, how much money you have in the bank, and how many people are in your family. You will have to give proof of how much you make. The government will ask to speak to your boss, see your bank statements and proof that you pay taxes.
If you qualify, you will probably be put on a waiting list. Section 8, like other public housing programs, has many people applying for them. You could be waiting many years before you actually get a voucher, which is like a coupon that says how much rent the government is willing to pay for you. If a landlord accepts you and your Section 8 voucher, you still have to sign a lease, or rental contract.",B1
"Introduction 
Did you know that, in the UK, there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff? It's a fact that's covered in a government-led review, released in May 2016, in which workers, employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process. Off the back of it, ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure low-paid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers. The government have announced a two-month consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness. 
Among the review's revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a 15% administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards. In some restaurants, the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash, if they don't collect enough tips, to cover these fees. The government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions. 
The government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, calling for the system to be made more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy. 
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether it's fair) and what would improve it for them. 
1. Rodri, 37, London: 'Around 50% of a waiter's income is tips' 
Average tips: GBP60 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. I've heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). Some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. So, if you sell GBP1,000 worth of food, the company will take GBP40. This is regardless of how much you make in tips. This means that if a table has a GBP100 bill and doesn't tip, the waiter has to pay GBP4 of their own money. This leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, to bad service. If a table doesn't tip, the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers. 
I can average around GBP60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over GBP100 and, on a poor night, it's around GBP40. Around 50% of a waiter's income is tips. All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure. America has it pretty good - everyone tips. 
2. Elle, 22, Edinburgh: 'We never know whether it's fair' 
Average tips: GBP20 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... France 
I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality. My main day job is in a cafe where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally. My main evening job is at a restaurant where we don't get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra GBP2.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff). My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips. 
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped - so we don't know whether we're getting our fair share or not. The system seems better in France, where they don't tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income. 
3. Ashley, 22, London: 'Tips go towards customer breakages' 
Average tips: GBP10-15 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... Australia 
I work in a south-east London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant. In both places, tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night. Money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers. If a member of the team gets off early, they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes. 
It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team underperforms. Equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they don't get what they've earned. It's really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. I make around GBP20 a shift but would only be given GBP10-15 of that money. When I am tipped well, the tips hugely impact on my finances. Occasionally, I will earn over GBP50 in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. However, I never get more than GBP30 of that money after it has been shared out. I really rely on tips because I am only paid GBP7 an hour. 
I'd rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and therefore didn't have to rely on tips to make ends meet. 
4. Tom, Manchester: 'A big night of tips can help pay the rent' 
Average tips: GBP40 per eight-hour shift 
I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy 
Where I used to work, floor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar. The 60% went into a tronc system, which helped boost kitchen salaries. I'm not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses. 
It's hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around GBP40, GBP20 from card tips. It can make a massive change to your weekly finances. Sometimes, people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent. 
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people don't add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for EUR19, they leave a EUR20 note and don't ask for change. They respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience shows.

"U.S. gasoline prices have declined for four weeks straight and now average more than 20 cents a gallon cheaper than a year ago, according to a new nationwide survey.
The average cost of a gallon across the continental United States of regular stands at $3.71, down 3 cents from two weeks earlier, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey. Prices have fallen nearly 9 cents a gallon in the past four weeks and are 22 cents cheaper than at this point in 2012, Lundberg said.
Lower prices in the Europe's benchmark Brent crude oil are largely behind the most recent fall. More U.S. refining capacity coming back on line after seasonal maintenance also contributed, Lundberg said.
 From there, short-term, we may see more price-cutting soon, perhaps on the order of this approximate 3-cent decline, she said. But the current picture suggests it wo n't be large. 
Gas prices broke a three-month upward spiral in early March, which had climbed nearly 54 cents since late December.
The Lundberg Survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations across the Lower 48 states every two weeks. The most expensive fuel in the latest survey, conducted Friday, was in Chicago, where pump prices averaged $4.10 a gallon; the cheapest could be found in Billings, Montana, at $3.33, Lundberg said.
Average per-gallon prices in other cities:
Atlanta: $3.57
Baton Rouge, Louisiana: $3.45
Boston: $3.75
Denver: $3.53
Las Vegas: $3.72
Memphis, Tennessee: $3.43
Miami: $3.74
Philadelphia: $3.64
San Francisco: $4.07
Seattle: $3.81

Dear James,
As you know, we have been working on the new perfume that we are launching in April and we are unsure about some of the packaging details. We have seen some of your creative work in the sales department and we think you have a very good eye for detail.
Do you have some time before close of business this Friday to sit down with us and talk through some of our designs? We would truly appreciate your advice on this. It shouldn't take longer than two hours of your time and we would be happy to clear it with Patricia, your department head, if necessary.

"""I got a Dyson vacuum cleaner but I don't even know if I want it. I just picked it up,"" Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the Black Friday sales. ""It was mental in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting."" 
Haggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour Sainsbury's supermarket in Harringay, north-east London with a friend in the hope of snapping up a bargain flat-screen TV. ""But so many people pushed in the queue we didn't have a chance,"" she said. ""The poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by a crowd of youths. She didn't get anything. People were behaving like animals - it was horrible,"" she said. ""I only saw two security guards."" 
Frustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40"" TV reduced from GBP299.99 to GBP149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from GBP319.99 to GBP159.99. ""I don't even know how much it costs; I don't know even know if I'm going to buy it. I just wanted something,"" she said. ""There are lads in there with three, four, five tellies. It's not fair."" 
One of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. ""I got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,"" he said. ""I couldn't tell you the prices but I know they're bargains."" But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn't as successful. ""Someone snatched my telly from me - it's cos I'm the smaller one."" 
Blackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury's at 12.45am after retreating from the ""bedlam"" of Tesco's 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. ""Tesco was scary so we came here instead,"" Blackett said. 
More than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items - TVs - for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticizing the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an IKEA furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. 
Police intervened at other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: ""Keep calm, people!"" South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became ""concerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events"". 
One of the first purchasers of a flat-screen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. ""I bought them for GBP250. I'll sell it to you for GBP350, GBP300 cash,"" he said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn't impressed. ""I got here at 10.15pm and I'm further back now than when I got here,"" she said. ""None of that lot know what a queue is."" 
Ball, who, like most of the shoppers, had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until now, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. ""Not one of those massive ones; just a normal one at GBP100 or so,"" she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. ""Telly, milk and bread - the necessities,"" she said. 
Mel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. ""It's crazy, really, having it at midnight - the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales. We're going to PC World first thing - their sale starts at 8am.""

"After middle or junior high school, U.S. students go to high school. Going to school is free in the United States, including high schools. Students do not need to pay tuitions, and even textbooks and lunches are free. Of course, we are talking about public schools. If parents choose to send their kids to private schools, they need to pay very expensive tuitions. High school is the last four years of school that students in the U.S. are required to attend by law.
 
High school students are divided by grades. It begins at 9th grade and finishes with 12th grade. Some high schools, even public high schools, have admission exams or an application process. Public schools admit students based on where they live. In order to successfully complete high school, students have to complete a series of core classes including math, English, science, history, a foreign language, and gym or physical education. Students usually can also choose to take electives, or specialized courses in a subject that interests them. Some high schools in the U.S. have exit exams that students are required to pass in addition to completing their courses in order to graduate and earn a high school diploma. A law called the No Child Left Behind Act requires high schools that get federal money to make students take a standardized exam every year. A high school diploma is required for students who want to continue on to college and is considered a minimum requirement for any jobs.
High schools classes are designed to prepare students for college. Some high schools offer specialized skills so that students can find work after graduation without going to college. Those are called vocational high schools. In high school, some students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These are college level classes. If the students pass an exam after taking AP classes, they can get college credit. In high school, students move from class to class throughout the school day.",B1
"After selecting Carl as her partner, Jenny needed to start planning for the dance competition at her school. The competition started in two months. Jenny was aware that Carl was not a great dancer. She had to dedicate some time in helping him improve his skill. On the first few days of preparation, Jenny had planned out their dance routine, with the help of her teacher. They were going to be dancing to ""Jailhouse Rock"" by Elvis Presley.
 
Jenny and Carl spent the first two weeks memorizing their steps and cues to their dance. Carl was pretty clumsy at first. He eventually got the hang of it. They spent the rest of the time perfecting their moves. The day of the competition was almost near. Jenny and Carl were beginning to get nervous. They were going up against nine other pairs from the same school.
The day of the competition arrived. Carl had not become a great dancer, but had definitely improved since he began. Since Jenny won last year's competition, she was to perform with Carl last. The pairs that were performing this year were better dancers compared to last year's competition. As each pair took the stage one by one, Jenny grew more anxious. Carl noticed this from Jenny and told her, ""It'll be okay, Jenny. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win."" Jenny felt better after hearing Carl's words. Soon, it was their turn to perform. They walked on stage and began to dance as soon as their song started to play.
They were off to a great start. Jenny's class was there cheering them on. The crowd began cheering them on as well. Suddenly, Jenny tripped and fell. The crowd was shocked. Carl managed to get Jenny back up on time for their big finale. Jenny was upset because of her fall. After their performance, the judges tallied up the scores and were ready to announce the winner. Jenny and Carl won, but it was a close call. If it wasn't for Jenny's talent and Carl's quick thinking to keep the routine going, they wouldn't have won. They were both awarded with a trophy and medals. Jenny and Carl were full of cheer.

"Every time you're online, you are bombarded by pictures, articles, links and videos trying to tell their story. Unfortunately, not all of these stories are true. Sometimes they want you to click on another story or advertisement at their own site, other times they want to upset people for political reasons. These days it's so easy to share information. These stories circulate quickly, and the result is ... fake news.
There is a range of fake news: from crazy stories which people easily recognise to more subtle types of misinformation. Experts in media studies and online psychology have been examining the fake news phenomenon. Read these tips, and don't get fooled!
1. Check the source
Look at the website where the story comes from. Does it look real? Is the text well written? Are there a variety of other stories or is it just one story? Fake news websites often use addresses that sound like real newspapers, but don't have many real stories about other topics. If you aren't sure, click on the 'About' page and look for a clear description of the organisation.
2. Watch out for fake photos
Many fake news stories use images that are Photoshopped or taken from an unrelated site. Sometimes, if you just look closely at an image, you can see if it has been changed. Or use a tool like Google Reverse Image search. It will show you if the same image has been used in other contexts.
3. Check the story is in other places
Look to see if the story you are reading is on other news sites that you know and trust. If you do find it on many other sites, then it probably isn't fake (although there are some exceptions), as many big news organisations try to check their sources before they publish a story. 
4. Look for other signs
There are other techniques that fake news uses. These include using ALL CAPS and lots of ads that pop up when you click on a link. Also, think about how the story makes you feel. If the news story makes you angry, it's probably designed to make you angry.
If you know these things about online news, and can apply them in your everyday life, then you have the control over what to read, what to believe and most importantly what to share. If you find a news story that you know is fake, the most important advice is: don't share it!",B1
"Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent drop in third-quarter profits, as the company announced its results Thursday.
Customers check Sony's Bravia brand LCD TVs at an electronics shop in Tokyo, Japan.
Profits for the quarter, which ended December 31, fell from nearly 200 billion yen -LRB- $2.2 billion -RRB- in 2007 to about 10 billion yen -LRB- $110 million -RRB- in 2008.
Across the company, sales were down 25 percent, but electronics and games sales were especially hard hit.
Sales of games, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent over the year. Sales of electronics decreased by nearly 30 percent.
The appreciation of the yen also cut into profits.
A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to lower their profit margins to keep prices the same.
Last week, Sony warned that it will close out the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with an operating loss of 260 billion yen -LRB- $2.9 billion -RRB-, its first in 14 years. Watch what lies ahead for Sony

"Making an appointment to see the dentist is usually one of the smartest decisions a person could make for his or her health. However, for Marek, booking his dentist appointment ended up being one of the worst mistakes in his life. This was because of the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit was his ex-girlfriend whom he had recently broken up with to be with another woman. This silly mistake resulted in Marek walking out of the dentist's office with all the 32 teeth missing.
 
""I didn't have any reason to doubt her,"" says Marek. ""I mean I thought she was a professional"". Quite on the contrary, his ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect chance to get her revenge for having been heart-broken. She gave him a heavy dose of anesthesia, pulled out all of his teeth, and bandaged his whole face up with gauze so that her work wouldn't be noticed until the bandages were all pulled off. ""The bandages are to protect your gums,"" she told Marek, who then left the office, still heavily numbed by the effects of the anesthesia.
As the anesthesia wore off on his way home, he could tell something was terribly wrong because he couldn't feel any teeth. One can only imagine the panic he must have felt after uncovering his ex's work under all the gauze. After reporting the event to the police, his ex is now facing the possibility of three years in prison for a doctor's malpractice suit. On the bright side for her, she might be spending those three years behind bars pleased at knowing that her shocking stunt was very effective in terms of getting even with Marek. After seeing that he no longer had any teeth, his new girlfriend broke up with him.",B1
"There is perhaps no greater American cartoon character than the world famous Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is a creation of the late Walt Disney, who pioneered the age of theme parks into popular, American culture. Today, Mickey is the official mascot of the Walt Disney Corporation. He is what is called an anthropomorphic character, which is a term used to describe a non-human character that has human characteristics. Mickey can speak, laugh, cry, and use his hands like a human. He also walks on two legs rather than four. His trademark red shorts, large yellow shoes, white gloves, and over-sized mouse ears make him one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in America, and in the world.
 
Mickey was created by Disney in 1928 in the short film Steamboat Willie. That film was the first of 130 films starring the famous mouse. He has also starred in 10 full-length, feature films. In the 1930s, Mickey began to appear in comic books, and on November 18, 1978 he got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He became the first cartoon character to earn a star on the historic sidewalk. Ten of his films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Lend a Paw winning the award. Walt Disney received an Honorary Award for creating the character in 1932.
One of the most popular children's shows in American history was the ""Mickey Mouse Club,"" which ran from 1955 to 1996. Mickey has a girlfriend named Minnie Mouse, a dog named Pluto, and a host of friends that include Donald, and Daisy Duck, who are stars on their own.
Today, Mickey Mouse merchandise can be found world wide. He appears in all Disney theme parks throughout the world. In 1988 Mickey made his last full-length film appearance when he starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This was a significant occurrence because it was the first time that Disney characters starred alongside Warner Brother's characters. The two corporations had been long-time rivals.

"The stereotype is that Americans are lazy, but studies show that people in the U.S. get less vacation time than people in other parts of the world. A typical American worker gets two or three weeks off out of a whole year for vacation. Most U.S. workers cannot take those two or three weeks consecutively. They usually have to be spread out throughout the year. Even when U.S. workers are on vacation, they are often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means checking in via email and mobile phone. Most U.S. businesses do not encourage their employees to take all the vacation days they are entitled to. In fact, most U.S. companies discourage it.
 
Other countries, especially countries in Europe, have much more vacation time. In Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks can be taken consecutively. Maybe this is why Europeans and other travelers vacation in far-off exotic places. Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely leaving the country.
The difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in countries outside the U.S. have to give paid time off to their employees or else pay hefty fines. However, in the U.S. there is no federal law requiring employers to give workers paid vacation. In fact the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't guarantee yearly time off to workers. There have been efforts to pass laws giving U.S. workers one week of paid vacation by law, but so far those efforts have not been successful.
Even when U.S. workers do have time off, many are afraid to take it because they worry they may be seen as non-productive workers and lose their job. Other workers worry about going on vacation and having a mountain of work when they return.",B1

The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear.
There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said.
Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving.
The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change.
 Queens Day will never be the same, the Trouw newspaper said. The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family. With this comes a Queen who not only cycles a bike, but also mixes with people without obvious security measurements. Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack ? 
The Algemeen Dagblad newspaper agreed.
 What is going to happen on the 30th of April next year ? And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague ? 
Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen.
Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government.
Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances.
The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.

"Andrea's big day was finally here. She had been accepted into the medical school of her dream in Boston, and was about to fly there to begin her new life. She had gotten the news of her acceptance two months ago, but had spent all that time so busy preparing for the move that she hadn't had time to realize how nervous she really was. It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the plane seat that she realized her legs were shaking, her heart was racing, and her forehead was sweating.
 
""Keep calm!"" she kept repeating to herself the whole way to her new apartment. She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew that she had nothing to be afraid of. Still, as she looked out of her new living-room window, the world outside looked much too scary to face. Having grown up on the West Coast her whole life, she was not prepared for how everything looked here. The warm, bright sun that she was so used to seeing out this time of year was nowhere to be seen. Everyone's accents seemed completely unfamiliar, and the people even seemed taller than normal.
She decided to stay in the safety of her apartment that night and didn't go outside until it was time for her class the following afternoon. As the professor asked some basic questions to see what level everyone was at, Andrea's mind went completely blank. ""Oh no!"" she thought to herself. ""I'm not even supposed to be here! Everyone knows so much more than me."" Just then, the professor pointed at her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. As frightened as she was, the answer was just blurted out of her mouth instinctively. ""Impressive!"" says the teacher. ""You'll do just great here."" she assured her. As the teacher walked away, one of the pesky giant ants crawled across Andrea's desk. She quickly flicked it off the edge, and then smiled confidently.

"All week, Frank and Bob have been looking forward to Sunday afternoon. That is when their favorite football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, plays their first game of the season. The Eagles have a new coach, and many new, young, and talented players. Football can be a very unpredictable game, with weather, injuries, referees, and luck all affecting the outcome of the game. On top of that, new players and coaches may need some time to learn to work as a team.
 
For almost a decade now, Frank and Bob have watched Eagles games together. They met through work, but their friendship continues even though Frank left the company a few years back. Their wives have become close and sometimes even join them for the games. When their sons were still young, they used to be just as excited about these Sunday afternoons. Now in high school, they'd rather hang out with their friends than their fathers. Nonetheless, Frank and Bob have kept up their friendship and this tradition, and couldn't think of a better way to spend Sunday afternoons.
This week, they will be watching the game at Bob's house, who is anxious to show off the new sound system he installed in his basement. As Frank walks up the driveway, carrying a pack of their favorite beer, Bob walks out to meet him, already dressed in Eagle's uniform. After some playful punching, they come together for a quick embrace. Once inside, they are greeted by the familiar sounds of the pre-game show. It's going to be a great season!",B1

"Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather. He died in 1946, six years before she was born. But, on Tuesday 8th April, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea. Thought to be the world's oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany. 
""It was very surprising,"" Erdmann, 62, said, recalling how she found out about the bottle. ""A man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. He then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather."" Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in Berlin after the letter was given to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg. 
The brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the catch of Konrad Fischer, a fisherman, who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel. Holger von Neuhoff, curator for ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across. ""There are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum,"" he said. ""But, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. It is in extremely good condition."" 
Researchers believe Erdmann's grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913. He was 20 years old at the time. 
Much of the postcard was indecipherable, although the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible, as was the author's polite request that the note be sent by the finder to his home address. 
""He also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not incur a cost,"" Erdmann said. ""But he did not think it would take 101 years."" 
She said she was moved by the arrival of the message, although she had not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born. 
""I knew very little about my grandfather, but I found out that he was a writer who was very open-minded, and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,"" she said. ""He did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from."" 
Like her grandfather, Erdmann said, she also liked culture and travelling around the world. She described herself as open-minded, too. ""What he taught his two daughters, my mother taught me and I have then given to my sons,"" she said. Despite her joy at receiving the bottled message, she said that she hoped others would not repeat what her grandfather had done and throw bottles with messages into the sea. ""Today, the sea is so full of so many bottles and rubbish that more shouldn't be thrown in there,"" she said. 
The message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburg's Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014, after which experts will attempt to decipher the rest of the text. It is not clear what will then happen to the bottle, but Erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum. 
""We want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,"" she said.

"Karla had just moved to the city and enrolled her eight-year-old son Gavin in a new school. Karla used to be a very active participant in the school community. She always volunteered in the classroom, went to Parent-Teacher Association meetings, and chaperone on class trips. Karla wanted to do the same thing at the new school her son was attending. She felt it was a good example for Gavin, and it helped her be more in tune with whatever was going on at the school.
 
The new school, however, had different rules. Karla couldn't just show up in the classroom and offer to help. She couldn't even offer to chaperone on class trips. District regulations required her to be fingerprinted. The school district would then run a background check on Karla based on the fingerprints. The school district had very strict rules about allowing people with criminal convictions to volunteer in the school.
While it didn't cost Karla anything to get fingerprinted, the fingerprinting office had very limited hours. She also couldn't just walk in when it was convenient for her. She had to make an appointment. The fingerprinting office was also located very far from where Karla lived. She would have to take two buses to get there.
Karla also had to get a tuberculosis test. The TB test was easy. It was just a little prick on her lower arm but this required another separate appointment at a separate location. The test didn't cost Karla anything, but again, the office where she had to go was far.
Karla understood that the school district wants children to be safe and healthy, but she also felt they were making it hard for parents.",B1
Jim had two separate sheets of paper. He wanted to put the two sheets of paper together. He did not want to glue them together. He did not want to use glue. He did not want to staple them together. He did not want to use a staple. What did Jim want to use? He wanted to use a paper clip. He wanted to put the two sheets of paper together with a paper clip. He picked up a paper clip. It was a metal paper clip. It was a silver paper clip. Jim put the silver metal paper clip on both sheets of paper. Now the sheets of paper were together. They were not separate.,B1
"Arguably the greatest Major League Baseball player of all time is George Herman Ruth. The ""Babe,"" as he was known, is largely responsible for building the game as it exists today. The stadium where he played in New York is commonly called ""The House that Ruth Built."" Ruth played baseball for 22 years for the Boston Red Sox, and the New York Yankees, where he rewrote the record books. He almost single-handedly invented the home run, which is baseball's most cherished feat. Before Ruth, the home run was a novelty. It was a game of strategy, but the Babe changed all that.
 
Ruth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his childhood has been lost to history. He spent a number of years at St. Mary's reformatory school after being labeled as ""incorrigible."" His behavior was thought to be beyond rehabilitation. When exactly he got his start in baseball is also a mystery. Some accounts offer that he was placed on St. Mary's baseball team by the coach of the time. One popular story has Ruth being sent to the school because of his natural ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing baseball on the streets, and that is why he was sent to the school in the first place.
Before the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players around the bases by strategically hitting the ball within the park. Ruth came in and was soon hitting balls out of the ballpark to the delight of the fans in attendance. The home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth earned several nicknames because of his power, including the ""Bambino,"" and the ""Sultan of Swat.""
When Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular move, the Yankees won seven World Series championships in his 12 years. Ruth made headlines for his after-hours antics in New York City as well. His drinking, and womanizing are well-documented. However, Ruth was a spiritual man who lived-out his years as a devout Catholic.",B1
The days were hot. The nights were hot. He turned on the living room fan. He turned on the dining room fan. Both fans were on high speed. They made a lot of noise. But they didn't blow cool air. They blew hot air. They blew hot air everywhere. He turned off the fans. He turned on the air conditioner. He closed all the windows. He closed the front door. The apartment began to cool down. It got cooler and cooler. Then he heard a bang. It was a loud bang. He thought a plane had crashed onto the roof. But it wasn't a plane. It was the air conditioner compressor. It had broken down. He opened the door. He opened the windows.,B1
"One of the finest Hollywood directors in the history of the film industry is Steven Allan Spielberg. Spielberg has directed some of the most significant and popular films in recent Hollywood history. His list of films reads like a who's who in the movie industry. He has directed such blockbusters as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan.
 
Born into a Jewish family on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the young Spielberg showed an interest in filmmaking during his teen years. When he was 12 years old, Spielberg created a nine-minute film to earn his photography badge in the Boy Scouts. This was the first film he made. His parents divorced when he was 13, and Spielberg moved with his family to California. After graduating from high school, he applied to the University of Southern California (USC) to learn filmmaking, but did not graduate. Instead he attended Long Beach State, where he earned his degree in Film Production and Electronic Arts, 35 years after first attending college.
His early work was as a television writer, having written scripts for popular shows such as Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Columbo in the 70s. His breakthrough film in Hollywood was 1975's Jaws, which is one of the most popular, highest-grossing blockbuster in the history of the Silver Screen. He followed the success of Jaws with several films that have earned him a spot in Hollywood lore. His films have become household names.
Spielberg shows no signs of slowing down. He is involved in several film projects as a director, and a producer. Spielberg has been married twice, and has six children. He was voted Forbes Magazine's Most Influential Celebrity in America in 2014. His personal wealth is estimated to be more than $3 billion.

"President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released its June fundraising numbers Monday, reporting that it raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney's approximately $100 million. The campaign responded with thanks to the more than 706,000 donors who got the campaign to that point but also appealed for more money.
 We still got beat -- and not by a little bit, Ann Marie Habershaw, chief operating officer for Obama for America, said in the e-mail. If we lose this election, it will be because we did n't close the gap enough when we had the chance. 
To be sure, neither campaign is raking in chump change. As we did with Romney's contributions, here's what the president could get for his $71 million.
2,071 students could attend the Sidwell Friends School for a year. Daughters Sasha and Malia attend the exclusive private school in Northwest D.C. -LRB- you could also afford hot lunches -RRB-. At $34,268 annually, the school's tuition ranks higher than the average private university tuition in the United States and more than double what it costs to go to a public university.
32,272 Portuguese water dogs. At approximately $2,200 per pet, Bo, the first dog, could take on 32,272 purebred, hypoallergenic friends.
479,729 J. Crew Pembridge Dot pencil skirts. First lady Michelle Obama wore one at 10 Downing Street to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, and on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The double-worn mint green skirt runs $148 at the American clothing chain.
8 million pounds of arugula. While in Iowa in 2008, Obama was criticized for being out of touch after he asked a group of farmers whether they had checked out the price of arugula at Whole Foods. The boutique grocery store did n't open its first Iowa store until spring of this year, and several people present at his speech admitted they did n't know what arugula was. The current price is about $9 per pound.
3 Martha's Vineyard estates. The Obamas wo n't be going on vacation to Blue Heron Farm, otherwise referred to as the Summer White House off Cape Cod, and not just because of the demanding campaign schedule. The compound, which includes two full-sized homes, a par-3 golf hole and equestrian facilities, was listed in August for $23.7 million.
18,525 orders of Ben's Chili Bowl's chili half-smokes and cheese fries for the next year. At $10.50 per order, the Obama favorite could be a feast for a lot of your closest friends for the next 365 days.
65,558,632 Yuengling Lagers. At $6.49 per six-pack, the cost of one of Obama's favorite beers is approximately $1.08. Triple the cost at a bar, and you could still enjoy the company of 22 million other people -- 7 % of the U.S. population -- sipping on the Pennsylvania brewery's finest
417,671 Spalding official NBA game balls. $71 million buys almost a half-million of the $169.99 basketballs. That means with 10 people to a court at a time, more than 4 million people could play one of Obama's -- and Americans-- favorite sports simultaneously.
Take 7,099 couples on a Hawaiian vacation. The first couple could spring for the $10,000 to bring that many couples with them on a five-day holiday to the president's home state.

"Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 buildings. It is named for a famous New York City business magnate, John D. Rockefeller, who built the group of buildings from 1930-1939. The most famous building in the complex is the General Electric building where NBC television studios are based. It is smack in the middle of Manhattan, New York City, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 48th and 51st Streets. The address of the GE building is 30 Rockefeller Plaza. That's how the show ""30 Rock"" got its name. The show was filmed there. Saturday Night Live, a popular American late night show, is also filmed there. Visitors can get tickets to see a show being taped and can also tour the studios.
 
Visitors to Rockefeller Center can visit the plaza, which becomes an ice skating rink in the winter. Every year a huge Christmas tree is placed there and thousands of people attend the tree lighting ceremony, which always features famous singers. In the spring, summer, and fall, the plaza becomes a cafe. In the middle of the plaza is a statue of the Greek god Prometheus. His myth states that he brought fire to the world. 200 flags from all countries of the United Nations surround the plaza.
Radio City Music Hall is another famous building in Rockefeller Center. Many musicians give concerts here, but it is best known as the home of the Rockettes, a dance company named for Rockefeller Center. They are famous for their kick lines and are best known for performing in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual musical holiday stage show.",B1
"If you want to rent an apartment, you need to sign a lease, which is a legally binding contract between you and the landlord, the person who owns the property. A lease is usually good for a set time. Some leases are on a month-to-month basis, but most are for a period of one year or two years.
 
The lease or rental agreement lists out your responsibilities as a tenant and the landlord's responsibilities. The lease will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when it is due, and how you can pay it. Some landlords will only take a certified check or money order, and others will accept a personal check or cash. If you pay your rent late, there is usually a late fee. The amount of the late fee is also usually in the lease. The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. Usually it is the amount of one month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places do not allow pets. If you bring one in anyway, they can fine you or kick you out. If your apartment does allow pets, most likely you will have to pay an extra amount of money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damages caused by the animal. Other rules that may be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the property and whether you are allowed to make any changes like paint. Many landlords do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang up pictures.
A lease is proof that you legally live somewhere. Sometimes you need a lease to show a school that you live within a certain area. Make sure you get a copy of the signed lease from your landlord.",B1
"Most children in the U.S. begin school at age 5, when they go to kindergarten. This is the beginning of elementary or primary school. Most children stay in elementary schools till they are about 11 years old. Elementary schools are divided by grades. The youngest children begin in kindergarten at 5, and then go to first grade, second grade and so on. Most elementary schools go up to fifth or sixth grade.
 
The focus of an elementary school is basic academic and socialization skills. Mostly children learn how to read, write, count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Students also learn the rules of English grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. Children also learn basic social studies or history, science, art, and music skills, and participate in gym or physical education. In elementary schools children also learn how to follow directions, share, and work in groups. Students usually stay in one classroom all day with one teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students may leave the classroom to visit the school library, the school gym, and attend special science, art, and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recess. For lunch students sit at tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recess is usually a half hour when children go out into a yard to play. The typical school day starts at about 8:00 in the morning and ends at about 3:00 p.m. Students go to school from Monday to Friday and have the weekends off.
Elementary school teachers are licensed by the state where they work. They have to graduate from college, or even graduate school taking special classes in Early Childhood and Elementary Education. Before teachers can be in a classroom with students, they have to pass a background check and take an exam.",B1
"The game of baseball in the United States is the oldest major league sport in the country. Major League Baseball traces its roots back to the 1880s, but the game had been enjoyed by Americans for decades before then. The origins of the game are in question. For many years a 19th Century American named Abner Doubleday was credited with creating the game, but this has been proven inaccurate today.
 
One theory is that the game was brought across the Atlantic Ocean during the great European migration of the 18th Century, and that it is based on the British game of cricket. Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played by mostly the upper-class members of that society, and it is unlikely that the poor immigrants from England played the game very much. However, it more closely resembles the game of rounders, which is another English sport that shares many common features as the American game of baseball.
In any event, the game became very popular in the United States. By the 20th Century, the American League, and the National League were taking the country by storm. The greatest single team in either league's history is the New York Yankees. The Yankees have won more World Series titles than any other team in history.
The World Series is a seven-game competition with the two top teams from either league. The first team to win four games is declared the World Series Champion. In 1903, The Boston Americans won the first World Series beating the Pittsburgh Pirates. This was the start of an annual series matchup between the two leagues. To date, the Yankees have won 27 championships in 40 appearances, with the team's most recent title coming in 2009. The St. Louis Cardinals lead the National League with 11 titles in 19 appearances, with its last title coming in 2011.",B1

"The hockey team Los Angeles Kings won the 2014 Stanley Cup, and had a parade last Monday in Los Angeles to celebrate the victory. During the parade, fans from all over California came out to support and celebrate with their favorite hockey team. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, over 200 uniformed officers were sent to the parade to make sure everything went okay. Although the parade went by without a problem, the LAPD's Public Information Officer said that there was an increase in alcohol related arrests than when the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012.
 
According to Christopher Harris, who attended the parade with his family, a lot of people who attended the parade had gone to the bars surrounding the Staples Center, and had gotten drunk before attending the parade. ""I saw one person throw up on the street in front of a policeman. They put him in the back of the police car,"" Harris said. The cheers from the crowd started getting louder and louder as the players from the Kings started passing by.
Robert Lopez, who attended the parade even though he was rooting for the New York Rangers, said that the Kings fans started getting really annoying. He was pretty sure it was because of the alcohol; everyone seemed pretty drunk. Lopez said that he was glad that he didn't bring his New York Rangers jersey, as he originally planned on, because he said people would have definitely thrown stuff at him.
A public relations worker for Los Angeles Kings issued a statement for the hockey organization saying that they do not condone people to drink before going to attend the parade. He went on to say that they took the precaution of having the parade start earlier than it did in 2012 so that people didn't have a chance to go get a drink. It seems as if it still failed.",B1
"In the United States someone legally becomes an adult when they turn 18 years old. At 18, U.S. citizens can vote. They can also serve in the military and go fight in wars for the country. An 18-year old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in the U.S. need to wait until they are 21 to be able to do that.
 
At the age of 18, people can legally live on their own, work, and get married. However, turning 18 doesn't mean everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities. At the age of 18, most people are just graduating from high school. Many will go to college. Some young people choose to go to college far from their homes and live in dormitories. Others pick a college close to home and stay with their parents to save money. Yet others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a parent does not have to provide for their child when the child turns 18.
Some parents in the U.S. take this very seriously and expect their children to move out as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even forcibly kick their kids out when the kids turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on if the kid is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a female to stay living with her parents after her 18th birthday. Many females aren't expected to leave their parents' house until they get married. There is still an expectation for young men, however, to go out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the economy of the U.S. struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang kids, since like a boomerang, they return where they came from.",B1
"The American community college system is a place for second chances. Community colleges are two-year schools that thrived in California after the end of World War II. Many American military personnel were returning to civilian life after their service to the country. Some of these young people decided not to go to college after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need. When they returned, many of them turned to the community college system in California to continue their education.
 
The United States government introduced the G.I. Bill at that time giving returning servicemen and women educational benefits to help them get back to school. Soon community colleges and new school districts began appearing throughout the country. Community colleges helped ease returning military personnel back into college life. It was a low cost, less stressful alternative to going back to a four-year university.
Today, community colleges attract students from all parts of the world. In California, a large population of students comes from Asia and Latin America. These schools provide a second chance to international students who may have experienced difficulties attending college in their native countries. American students who may have not done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, can turn to community college for a second chance, too.
Community colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students. Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they can always try something else. That is the beauty of community colleges.",B1
