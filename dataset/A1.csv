"Can you explain baseball to me?
I can try to explain the basics. What do you want to know?
What are strikes?
Every batter has three strikes. When they get three strikes, they are out.
Okay, but what about when the umpire calls a ball?
Once an umpire calls four balls, then the batter goes to first base.
What happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball?
The batter goes to first base.
What if someone is on first base?
Then whoever was on first base goes to second base.
Oh, okay. What's a no-hitter?
A no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game.
So, that's a good thing for the pitcher?
Yes, because that means he pitched really well.",A1

Fred kicked the ball. His dog ran after the ball.,A1
"Why don't you ever answer your phone?
I'm usually busy. What's up?
I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.
Where do you want to go? I don't have that much money.
Let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.
Okay, but I only have enough for three beers.
It's fine. I'll pay for the rest, but you owe me.
Screw that, I paid for you last time. You owe me!
Well, then we can call it even.
I guess so. Where should we meet?
How about at the train station by the bar?
Sounds good. I'll see you in an hour.
Great. See you then, laters.",A1
"Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?
Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?
Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.
You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.
But I want the one with pictures!
Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.
Fine, I admit you're right.
You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.
Yay! I love tigers.
I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.
Great! You're so helpful.
It's my job to be helpful.",A1

That's not good. I heard there is a flu going around.
Well, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.
Sucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.
It is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.
That's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.
True. Perhaps we can go some other time?
For sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.
Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.
Cool, see you later.",A1

Do you know where the gym is?

Okay, your classroom is behind the gym.
That's really helpful! Thank you.
No problem, and the ""21"" means it's upstairs.",A1

I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.
It's okay, because I don't even like this library.
This library doesn't like you either!
I am leaving! You are plain rude.
Leave! Nobody wants to see you.",A1

"Each September volunteers clean up the beach. Hundreds of volunteers clean up the beach. They carry empty trash bags. They pick up trash. They fill up the trash bags. They fill up hundreds of trash bags. They put all the trash bags into trucks. The trucks take the trash bags to a landfill. The trash goes from the beach to the landfill.

"William Moore didn't trust the idea of marriage. He came from a broken family. His mother and father divorced when he was only 10 years old. Both of his two brothers had been married twice; each marriage ended in divorce. ""Marriage is the end,"" William always said. His view on marriage always got in the way of his relationships. He would go out on dates with women who would always be looking for something serious. William wasn't looking for that. He wanted someone to have fun with and that was all.
 
William hadn't found someone he felt strongly about in a long time. The last time he truly felt something for a girl was during his last year of college. Her name was Linda. Linda was in William's math class, and she always helped William with his homework. They started hanging out after school, and going on dates every week. When William told Linda about his views on marriage, she didn't get scared. In fact, she liked the idea. ""It's a lot of pressure. A lot of guys think that women just want marriage, you know, I don't. At least not right now,"" Linda said.
William decided to give Linda a chance. He liked her. They had the same view on marriage. Yet, during the final month of school, Linda got an email that changed her life. She got a chance to go study in Europe. William didn't want Linda to go. Linda said that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. William even thought about proposing to Linda to see if she would stay, but he knew that she would not change her mind. He let her go. It made William sad. He didn't know if he wanted marriage, but he really wanted to have someone there for him.",A1
