"Police and neighbors were searching for three young Michigan boys Saturday who have been missing since their father claimed he dropped them off with a woman before trying to kill himself a day earlier.
The father survived his suicide attempt and is being cared for in a mental health facility, said Morenci, Michigan, Police Chief Larry Weeks on Saturday.
But Michigan authorities do not know what has happened to his boys -- 5-year-old Tanner Skelton, 7-year-old Alexander William Skelton and 9-year-old Andrew Skelton -- prompting them to issue an Amber Alert on Friday.
Weeks said that the boysfather, John Skelton, told police that he dropped the boys off Friday morning with a woman he identified as Joann Taylor -- in part to ensure they did n't see him while and after he tried to commit suicide.
John Skelton told police that the woman, whom he allegedly met on the internet, was supposed to drop the boys off at their home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, around 3 p.m. Friday.
But the boys never went home and, Weeks added, authorities still are n't sure if John Skelton's story -- including Joann Taylor's existence -- is true or a fabrication.
 We have not been able to locate a Joann Taylor or confirm that she even exists, Weeks told reporters Saturday evening.
The last non-family member saw the boys at 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to the chief.
Their mother, Tanya, has been with police virtually the entire day on Saturday, answering questions and serving as what Weeks called a valuable resource at this time. 
Weeks said Tanya Skelton had contact with someone alleging to be Joann, adding only that this communication was not necessarily by phone or in person.
According to the Amber Alert, Taylor may have been from Jackson or Hillsdale counties and may be driving a silver van. Still, Weeks reiterated that they have yet to confirm she is real and, if so, if she is with the boys.
Saturday's press conference was crowded with media and residents of Morenci, many of whom have been searching for the young boys. Dozens spent Saturday searching along Bean Creek, Wakefield Park and the Riverside Natural Area -- all in Morenci -- according to Toledo-based CNN affiliate WUPW.
 We just hope they 're somewhere safe and warm playing video games, volunteer Carol Garcia told WUPW.
But authorities thus far have offered few tips pointing community members to places where the young Skeltons might be.
 We understand their drive and desire to be out there, said Weeks. The fact is, I can not tell the community there's a specific location they should be searching. 
The alert notes that Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry blond hair, has blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds.

"At least 26 people were killed Monday in the Syrian government's ongoing crackdown on dissidents, the pro-democracy group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
Among the dead was a 12-year-old boy shot to death when Syrian security forces fired on a funeral procession, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights..
The funeral procession was for a protester killed Sunday, the observatory said.
In addition, 17 people were killed during operations by the military and security forces in Hama as authorities searched for wanted activists and demonstrators, the organization said.
Meanwhile, an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said parliamentary elections could be held in the country by the end of the year, Russian media reported earlier Monday.
Bouthaina Shaaban, the political and media adviser to al-Assad, was in Moscow on Monday to speak to journalists on the situation in Syria.
 I can tentatively say that such elections may be held either at the end of this year or the beginning of next, Shaaban said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency.
The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday.
The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, is condemning the killing of a key Syrian opposition organizer who it says died while in the custody of Syria's security forces.
Ghiyath Mattar, described as a key organizer of protests against al-Assad's regime, was killed after being arrested last Tuesday in the Damascus suburb of Darya, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement released Sunday.
 His brave commitment to confronting the regime's despicable violence with peaceful protest serves as an example for the Syrian people and for all those who suffer under the yoke of oppression, the statement said
Mattar was arrested along with leading opposition activist Yahya Sharbaji and a number of other activists, Nuland said.
Mattar was a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be -- peaceful and nonviolent, said one of Mattar's friends. His death is an attack by the regime on peace. His attack is saying, We want to destroy the messengers of peace in Syria and the ideals and values they hold. 
 His personality was perfectly built to take the role of a leader, said another man, a colleague of Mattar's. Everyone loved him and he had so many close friends and relatives. 
Both men asked not to be named for fear of retribution.
On September 6, Mattar was with Sharbaji when he received a call from Sharbaji's brother saying he was injured and needed help, according to the friend. In reality, security forces had forced the brother to call Sharbaji. The operation led to the arrests, the friend said.
Unrest has plagued Syria for more than six months, as protesters demanding more freedom, democratic elections and an end to al-Assad's regime have been met by brute force.
The government has maintained a consistent narrative: It is going after armed terrorists. But opposition activists say the regime is behind a systematic, sustained slaughter.
Mattar, 26, was on the run for three months before being taken into custody, according to the Syrian Observatory.
The group, citing reports from Mattar's fellow opposition members, said he was tortured to death.
Syria's crackdown on protesters has been roundly condemned by many world leaders and the United Nations. The Arab League has publicly called for al-Assad's regime to show restraint and end the violence.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria, freezing assets of specific regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country. The European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and imposed a travel ban.
Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, put the number killed in the unrest at 2,600, citing reliable sources on the ground, in remarks prepared for delivery Tuesday during the commission's session.
The Syrian Observatory has said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March.
In her statement, Nuland repeated calls by the United States for al-Assad to step down.
 We call on the -LRB- al-Assad -RRB- regime to immediately cease all violence against the Syrian people and release all political prisoners. We again call on -LRB- al-Assad -RRB- to step aside and allow the Syrian people to embark upon the democratic transformation they demand, she said the in the statement.
A video posted on YouTube purportedly showing the funeral of Mattar in Darya showed people marching in the street and chanting: We will sacrifice our lives and our blood for you, Ghiyath and Freedom, freedom, we are the youths of freedom. 
Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died.
CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria.
CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Maxim Tkachenko, Mohammed Jamjoom and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.

"To many who watched his long, rambling video statement, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau appeared strangely distracted, unfocused, perhaps under the influence of drugs while boasting of abducting nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls.
But there is calculation in such cruelty, and method where some see madness. The kidnapping serves Shekau on many levels, and observers of Boko Haram say he should not be underestimated.
Shekau's on-camera performances are the opposite of the composed appearances of late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the terror group's current chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram with the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based research and analysis firm, says Shekau has even acknowledged the intellectual chaos of his presentations. But they impress his followers.
Shekau speaks classical Arabic and Hausa, the language of northern Nigerian Muslims, and had a religious education. As deputy to former Boko Haram leader Mohamed Yusuf, who was killed in 2009, Shekau delivered sermons littered with references to Islamic scholars. He also expressed admiration for al Qaeda as a jihadist movement, although Boko Haram is not an affiliate of the group.
Shekau's rejection of the Christian calendar and of allegiance to the Nigerian flag resonates in a region where resentment of a corrupt and distant government runs deep. And his frequent reference to the great Bornu Empire -- a Muslim kingdom that ruled northern Nigeria for some 500 years -- harks back to a golden age.
He is also ruthless in dealing with dissent. Shekau has no deputy and Zenn says that videos issued by the group never show other commanders. He kills anyone who challenges him, but to blow him off as a madman would be to underestimate his capabilities, says Zenn.
Twice wounded himself -- in 2009 and 2012 -- Shekau appears to revel in violence. After a series of attacks in Kano in 2012, he said: I enjoy killing anyone that God commands me to kill, the way I enjoy killing chickens and rams. 
Nor would Zenn be surprised if Shekau were under the influence of drugs when he recorded his video statement; they have sometimes been found in Boko Haram camps by the Nigerian military.
' I said I would... '
The mass abduction of teenage girls yet again delivered on a threat that Shekau has made repeatedly. Western education is a prime target of Boko Haram because in the group's view, it reinforces colonial and Christian influence and suppresses Islam.
In a July 2013 video, Shekau promised that schools would be burned and teachers killed. He has been true to his word. In February, a school in Nigeria's northern Yobe state was attacked and burned down, leaving 29 boys dead. And last September, more than 40 students at an agricultural college were killed.
In abducting so many schoolgirls, Shekau may also have wanted to humiliate the Nigerian government just as the World Economic Forum gathered in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.
Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, believes the abduction and other recent attacks are messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram followers in Islamic schools will be avenged. In 2012, Shekau's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody.
 Every time people have started talking about the decline of Boko Haram, it has emerged as deadlier and more fierce, Sani told CNN. This is about a strategy of violence more than about ideology. 
Rewarding the fighters
Boko Haram has suffered several setbacks in the last year. The emergence of civilian vigilante groups in cities like Maiduguri has pushed it into rural areas and the Nigerian military has gone on the offensive against the group.
According to Sani, Boko Haram now does most of its recruiting in the countryside, coercing or financially inducing vulnerable youngsters from poor homes to join its ranks. The mass kidnapping of the teenage girls from Chibok may have been part of an effort by Shekau to reinforce the loyalty of these largely uneducated young men by providing them with free servants or sex slaves, Zenn suggests. In his video, Shekau said of the girls: We would also give their hands in marriage because they are our slaves. 
 Many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it's a real horror and over the next years we 'll slowly hear the stories of girls few-by-few as they manage to make it out, Zenn told CNN.
Shekau's unbending, almost medieval Salafism sees girls and women as servants for whom education is a sin. Women must go and marry, he said in the video statement.
You ca n't get them back
The location of the abduction and the numbers involved were shrewd choices by Boko Haram. The girls were pulled from their beds at the school, loaded onto buses and trucks and swiftly transported to remote, hilly, forested areas in the northeastern corner of Nigeria. Boko Haram fighters are able to cross the permeable borders with Cameroon and Chad for resupply and to hide out, and U.S. officials believe some of the girls may already have been taken out of Nigeria.
Sani said the timing was no accident: the school was full of both Muslim and Christian pupils taking their final exams.
 They are likely to be in rural, mountainous and forested areas on the move with fighters, with some forced into marriages, he told CNN.
Zenn says it will be very tough to get them back.
 Boko Haram has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups, and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack, he said.
Sani also dreads any military operation.
 Any attempt to rescue the girls by force will end in a tragic result -- it could be Nigeria's Beslan, he said, referring to the attempt to free hostages at a school in Russia in 2004 that left more than 300 dead, many of them children.
Bargaining chips for prisoners, cash or concessions
Shekau is not beyond negotiating with the Nigerian government, despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of President Goodluck Jonathan's legitimacy. According to the International Crisis Group, negotiations in Ivory Coast a year ago were on the verge of producing an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire. Then Shekau was designated a terrorist by the U.S. State Department and abandoned the talks.
Sani believes Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of Boko Haram followers from prisons.
 The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible. Shekau's video is not going to be the last word from the group on the girls. 
And Sani suggests the notion of selling the girls should not be taken literally. People do n't buy girls in this part Africa, he said.
But at least some of them may be traded for ransom money. Boko Haram has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a French family kidnapped in northern Cameroon last year and reportedly freed for some $3 million. It also threatens business leaders in the North with abduction or worse unless they pay up.
The international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves Shekau.
 He does n't care at all about international opinion but he knows it has put pressure on the government to reach out to him, Sani said.
Just how that process might work is unclear, but Sani has called for a group of Islamic clerics and others to be set up to seek mediation. That would require recent laws banning anyone from having contact with Boko Haram to be waived.
Few believe Boko Haram is going to wither away until the government addresses inequalities in the allocation of funds between the Christian oil-producing south and the Muslim north.
Sani says the stakes could not be higher for the region.
 For now, Boko Haram's focus remains Nigeria, but as they become emboldened they will spread like a cancer throughout central and West Africa.

"The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupant.
Mistaken by security guards -- then hastily clearing nearby corridors -- as a Prime Ministerial staffer, I was left to witness Hawke's return to his office and his waiting family as an ex-Prime Minister, at that time the only one to be rejected by his own party.
Hawke came striding out of the caucus room, chin forward, moist eyes straight ahead, a clutch of dejected staff trailing behind. At the same moment his office door opened and out burst his then-wife, Hazel, sobbing. Either she 'd been expecting the worst or, more probably, there had been a phone call telegraphing it.
She flung herself at her husband. Hawke gathered her up, telling her Do n't cry, do n't cry. And as he disappeared into his office, he barked: I need a bloody cup of tea. 
If the humiliation of that evening's historic rejection winded him, Hawke did n't show it.
Soon afterwards trolleys of liquor were rolling along the corridors of Parliament House and Hawke hosted a wake that went for hours, open to all comers. He angered, in my sight, only once that night; he rounded on a particular reporter who had showered him with sympathy but who, in Hawke's view, had been long doing the bidding of the victor, Paul Keating.
Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns
Never before had the Labor Party dumped a serving Prime Minister, yet Hawke's equanimity -- outwardly at least -- was striking. You might have said he seemed both resigned and liberated about the loss of the job he 'd held for nearly nine years. Of course, the long contest with Keating had been aggravating to Hawke and sapping for his Government; Keating had effectively launched his challenge late the year before, in 1990, when he contended, in his PlA ! cido Domingo speech, that Australia had never had a great Prime Minister. Then he challenged Hawke in mid-1991, lost and went to the back bench until his second -- and successful challenge -- at the end of that year.
Hawke, the Labor Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke lined up for the kill.
Not so Kevin Rudd.
It has been an undeclared, subterranean campaign to reinstall Rudd in the Prime Minister's office -- one from which the candidate has, until now, been able to stay aloof. Rudd has portrayed himself as busy and contented within the Cabinet under Julia Gillard. As he described it last week, he has been a happy little Vegemite being Australia's foreign minister.
Invariably for Rudd, questions about the quality of the Labor Party leadership, the propriety of those who removed him from the Prime Minister's office or of who posted the now-infamous video of his rage on YouTube all are questions that should, he contends, be asked of others. Thus he causes those others -- and we mostly know who he means -- to fall under suspicion.
And in the resulting public imagery, it is not Rudd who is seeking to return to the Prime Minister's office; rather it is a semi-reluctant Rudd who is being ferried along by a group of ministers, MPs and Labor fixers who believe the only way that Labor can win against Tony Abbott and the Coalition at the next election is for Rudd to resume the leadership.
Gillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership vote
Their tactic has been to avoid having Rudd, unlike Keating, seen as an active seeker of his Prime Minister's job. The reasons are two-fold. The Rudd camp has not wanted to give the Prime Minister a reason to confront them head-on because to do so would be to risk provoking a leadership ballot before Rudd has assembled the numbers he needs -- and it's still doubtful that he has. Second, for Rudd to be seen publicly tearing at Gillard's leadership would play to a series of strong negatives -- that Rudd is motivated by revenge, that he has no regard for governance, that he is attacking a woman, that he has a monstrous sense of entitlement.
It may even be true, as some of Rudd's campaigners have claimed privately in the past few days, that Rudd did not set out to regain his old job after he was deposed by Gillard back in mid-2010. That instead, the ongoing poor opinion polling for the Labor Party, some avoidable stumbles by Gillard, stubborn resentment within the electorate about the manner of her ascendancy and the blandishments of some of his colleagues combined to persuade Rudd that his return was feasible.
But Rudd had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the Prime Minister's office.
Behind the scenes of Australia's political soap opera '
That plan still seemed intact until 1.38 pm on Saturday February 18, when a You Tube user, under the name of HappyVegemiteKR, uploaded a video showing a frustrated and increasingly furious Rudd attempting to complete a video message in the Chinese language but stumbling over the words. Filmed at least two years ago in his office, while he was Prime Minister, the video contained Rudd's unusable, profane outtakes, plenty of teeth-gnashing, wild-eyed fury, and blaming others including the dickheads in the embassy. 
Because the footage most likely had been retained in a Government archive, suspicion falls on the Prime Minister's office or somewhere nearby as HappyVegemiteKR's source. This conspiracy Gillard denies, but the enquiry, Rudd says, is another of those questions for others. 
Whatever its source, HappyVegemiteKR's video most likely will be remembered as much for the entertainment provided by a filthy Rudd, as for the trigger that brought his leadership challenge into the open.
Rudd learned of HappyVegemiteKR's You Tube activity early on Saturday evening as he was eating a Thai take-away meal at his Brisbane home with Bruce Hawker, the Sydney-based political strategist who has guided many Labor election campaigns.
Hawker is now openly connected to the Rudd campaign's camp and helped advise Rudd that night.
 The conspiracy theorists are out in number, says Hawker. But I was with him, and he was embarrassed and concerned and understood that he had to manage the problem quickly. The complication was that he was leaving the country the next morning. So the decision was made to contact Sky, which is a 24-hour news channel, and do an interview. As it turned out, I think that was the appropriate thing to do. 
Prompted and legitimized by the leaked video, by midnight Saturday Rudd was on Sky News, effectively sending to the Labor Party and Australians a revised CV that set down his qualifications for another shot at the Prime Minister's job. Apologizing for his language in the video, he said he had changed since being deposed by Gillard almost 20 months ago. He had learned to delegate more, to become less angry and listen up - especially to his colleagues.
It was a coded application for the return of his former job. And it was reinforced on Rudd's behalf on Monday morning when the former Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, publicly urged the Prime Minister to hold a leadership ballot. The Queensland band of brothers -- Rudd, Beattie and Bruce Hawker -- succeeded, finally, in flushing out publicly the Prime Minister's senior ministerial supporters to concede that which they have been careful for weeks not to: Gillard's leadership is under siege from within her own Cabinet and party room.
Tactically the day was a victory for Rudd; the leadership issue was out in public and now, sooner or later, it will have to be confronted.
There is anxiety and uncertainty on both sides over whether they have the numbers. Gillard is not going to a ballot, yet, and behaves as if life is business as usual in her dealings with the man she calls her foreign minister, usually -LRB- and unusually -RRB- not by his name. And Rudd is in the Mexican resort city of Los Cabos at a G20 meeting and will not return to Australia until the weekend.
Will he force a challenge when parliament returns on February 27 ?
Bruce Hawker -- a man who might know -- offers this: I think, nevertheless, once Rudd is back in town, there is going to be another buildup of pressure for this matter to be resolved once and for all. 
Should Rudd force a ballot ? I do n't know exactly how this is going to be played out. There are various scenarios but one thing that seems completely implausible is that it's just going to go away and that people will forget about it and move on to another issue. This is a boil that has to be lanced. 
Gillard, you would expect, knows that. She's wielded that lance before.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bernard Lagan and The Global Mail.

"Swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive. But are the country's prisons a soft option? 
The head of Sweden's prison and probation service, Nils Oberg, announced in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons are to be closed due to an ""out of the ordinary"" decline in prisoner numbers. 
Although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in Sweden's prisoner population, now a little over 4,500. A similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. Oberg admitted to being puzzled by the unexpected dip, but expressed optimism that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run. ""We certainly hope that the efforts we invest in rehabilitation and preventing relapse of crime has had an impact,"" he said. 
""The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978,"" says Kenneth Gustafsson, governor of Kumla Prison, Sweden's most secure jail, situated 130 miles west of Stockholm. However, he doesn't think the system has gone soft. ""When I joined, the focus was very much on humanity in prisons. Prisoners were treated well - maybe too well, some might say. But, after a number of high-profile escapes in 2004, we had to rebalance and place more emphasis on security."" 
Despite the hardening of attitudes toward prison security following the escape scandals, the Swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail terms rarely exceed ten years; those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term, usually in the region of 18 to 25 years. Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimize short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures, which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending. 
The overall reoffending rate in Sweden stands at between 30 and 40% over three years - to compare that with another European country, the number is around half that of the UK. One likely reason for the relatively low reoffending rate and the low rate of incarceration in Sweden (below 70 per 100,000 head of population) is that the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15. In the UK, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 record the highest reoffending rates: almost three quarters and two thirds, respectively. A good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails. In Sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life - this is not the case in many other countries - and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison. 
One strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden. A confident probation service - a government agency - is tasked not only with supervising those on probation but is also guaranteed to provide treatment programmes for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence issues. The service is assisted by around 4,500 lay supervisors - members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision. 
Gustafsson talks about broader goals and objectives for the Swedish justice department: ""In 2013 and 2014, the priority of our work will be with young offenders and men with convictions of violent behaviour. For many years, we have been running programmes to help those addicted to drugs. Now, we are also developing programmes to address behaviours such as aggression and violence. These are the important things for our society when these people are released."" I spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a social enterprise called X-Cons Sweden. Peter Soderlund served almost three years of a four-year sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998. He was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners called Kris (Criminals' Return Into Society). 
""The big difference between Kris and us is that we are happy to allow people who are still taking addiction medications to join us,"" he says. Both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after they have been released. And what is life like for the prisoner in Sweden? ""When I was inside, I was lucky. In Osteraker Prison, where I served my sentence, the governor was enlightened. We were treated well. But I knew that not all Swedish prisons were like that. I met so many people in there who needed help - after I received help from Kris, I knew I wanted to help others. With X-Cons, we meet them at the gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support."" 
""In Sweden, we believe very much in the concept of rehabilitation, without being naive of course,"" says Gustafsson. ""There are some people who will not or cannot change. But, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change, and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that. It is not always possible to achieve this in one prison sentence. 
""Also, it is not just prison that can rehabilitate - it is often a combined process, involving probation and greater society. We can give education and training, but, when they leave prison, these people need housing and jobs.""

"From: Jo Backhouse
To: Karl Anderson
Date: 17 October
Subject: Support for Judy
Dear Karl,
I received a call from Judy a couple of days ago to discuss some of the issues that she was having and I thought I'd give you a heads-up on what was said, seeing that you are Judy's project team leader.
Judy really enjoys working with you and the team and finds the project very interesting, but I think she's feeling a bit lost and struggling to see the big picture. It seems that she's been given a fair amount of autonomy to carry out the tasks that you've given her, and of course this level of delegation is not uncommon in your branch. But I believe in her Tokyo office, she is used to a bit more managerial direction and guidance and so is finding this international project quite daunting.
When I asked her about meeting her deadlines, she mentioned that due to the recent changes to the project timeline, her goalposts have been moved, and she doesn't seem to really understand why this has happened. Bearing in mind that she's also facing simultaneous deadlines from her department in Tokyo, we can presume that she might be feeling a bit stretched.
Looking ahead, I was wondering if we could make it easier for Judy by offering her more direction when setting her tasks, at least until she learns the ropes and gets used to working unsupervised. I think she'd also appreciate you giving her a clearer idea on how her role in the team fits into the overview of things. Do you think you could maybe outline the group and individual targets at your next team meeting and that way, everyone not only gets a reminder of the end goal, but each team member, including Judy, might have a more holistic view of the whole project?
I was also thinking it might help to touch base with her every so often to make sure that she's up to date with any changes to the overall plan of attack. In the meantime, I'll write to her manager in the Tokyo office and see how aware they are of the deadlines you've given her, and if they could in some way review her responsibilities and co-ordinate her tasks so that she doesn't constantly feel pulled in both directions.
Judy is an extremely conscientious worker and is eager to contribute positively to the team. Personally, I think she is someone with high potential and will be an asset to our international projects if properly mentored. I'm keen to know your thoughts on the matter and am open to any suggestions on how we could better support Judy so that she has a more smooth-sailing experience on the team.
Best regards,
Jo Backhouse

"A lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewis's Christmas 2015 advert, as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multi-million pound campaign. 
Amid increasing hype around John Lewis's seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many, the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK. It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday. 
The retailer has spent GBP7m on a campaign that ranges from the slick TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the- dark pyjamas, as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores. 
After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals - a bear and hare, then a penguin - this time, the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact. 
The ad's strapline is: ""Show someone they're loved this Christmas"", which echoes Age UK's own campaign: ""No one should have no one at Christmas"". Profits from three products - a mug, gift tag and card - will go to the charity. 
""The charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody,"" said Rachel Swift, head of marketing at John Lewis. 
The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by little-known Norwegian artist Aurora. 
The ad cost GBP1m to make. The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios, where the Harry Potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film, The Force Awakens. 
As in the last few years, John Lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on TV and social media using the hashtag #OnTheMoon. There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 - a complete coincidence, according to Swift. 
In 2014, the retailer also spent GBP7m on a campaign featuring a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of John Lennon's Real Love, sung by British singer-songwriter Tom Odell. It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January, ahead of the 16.6m clocked by Sainsbury's ad featuring First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the UK's next most popular ad of 2014. 
Swift said that, despite the hype, John Lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years. ""It's all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas,"" she said. ""We don't go into it thinking, 'This is going to be huge,' just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love."" 
Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, said John Lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time, with a lower- key presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors. ""There are definitely a lot more brands doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,"" she said. ""John Lewis still does the emotional piece the best. This campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers. I think people will think it is really cute."" 
Among those fighting for attention in the flurry of Christmas ads was sister chain, Waitrose, which launched its Christmas ad online on social media ahead of a TV debut during The X Factor . It used the agency which has created John Lewis's Christmas ads for years. 
Burberry has launched what is only its second festive film, featuring Romeo Beckham and Elton John, while electrical chain Currys drafted in Jeff Goldblum for its first ever dedicated Christmas ad. Asda, Lidl and Morrisons also launched their campaigns at the beginning of November. 
Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks & Spencer, which also launched its Christmas ad at the beginning of November, said that, in the first week of September, the most searched term on its website was Christmas. 
Boots, another retailer launching its festive campaign in early November, is going back to a more traditional approach after a critically acclaimed ad in 2014, which featured a family going to great lengths to get together at Christmas.

"Narrow passage of a sweeping health care bill by the House of Representatives portends a continuing difficult fight for President Obama and fellow Democrats to get a bill through the Senate and into law.
The House voted 220-215 late Saturday, with 39 Democrats opposed and one Republican in favor, to approve what would be the biggest expansion of health care coverage since Medicare was created more than 40 years ago.
The Affordable Health Care for America Act, or H.R. 3962, restricts insurance companies from denying coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition or charging higher premiums based on gender or medical history. It also provides federal subsidies to those who can not afford it. And it guarantees coverage for 96 percent of Americans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
But turning the bill into law remains uncertain. The Senate must now pass its own version of a health care bill, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada last week signaled uncertainty over whether that will happen this year.
Once both chambers have passed a bill, a congressional conference committee will merge the two proposals into a consensus version that would require final approval from each chamber and Obama's signature.
On Sunday, Obama praised the historic House vote to pass the bill and called on the Senate to take the baton and complete its work.
 For years, we 've been told that this could n't be done, Obama said, citing the decades of failed health care reform efforts. Last night, the House proved differently. 
The president called the support by many House members courageous in the face of the heated and often misleading rhetoric around this legislation. 
 Now it falls on the United States Senate to take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the American people, Obama said. And I 'm absolutely confident that they will. 
However, Republicans and an independent senator who sits with the Democratic caucus signaled Sunday that difficulties remain for Obama on his top domestic priority.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, reiterated that he would join a Republican filibuster against a health care bill if it contains a government-run public health insurance option after the chamber's amendment process.
Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Lieberman called the controversial public option, which is in the House bill and the Senate version being prepared by Reid, an unnecessary provision intended to bring government-run health insurance in the future.
 If the public option is in there, as a matter of conscience, I will not allow the bill to come to a final vote, Lieberman said. He previously has said he wo n't oppose opening Senate debate on the bill despite the public option provision, and he maintained that stance Sunday.
Lieberman's stance is crucial because the Democratic caucus has the minimum 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. Senate Republicans unanimously oppose the public option, though Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine has floated the possible compromise idea of a trigger mechanism that would mandate a public option in the future if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet.
The lone House Republican who supported the bill, Rep. Anh Joseph Cao, told CNN on Sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party.
Cao's yes vote ended up being unnecessary for House Democrats, but it gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi license to tout bipartisan support for the controversial measure.
 I felt last night's decision was the proper decision for my district, even though it was not the popular decision for my party, said Cao, a first-term representative from Louisiana's traditionally Democratic 2nd District. A lot of my constituents are uninsured, a lot of them are poor. It was the right decision for the people of my district. 
Cao acknowledged he extracted some White House pledges to help his district deal with the continuing effects of Hurricane Katrina in exchange for his vote. Asked about the reaction of fellow Republicans, Cao said the party's leaders respect my decision, and I respect theirs. 
Also Sunday, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, the chamber's third-ranking Republican, said on the Fox program that Democrats were ignoring the wishes of the American public by pushing through the huge health care bill.
Pence said the health care bill would raise costs, increase the deficit and lead to a government takeover of the health care system.
 I think the American people are deeply frustrated with the liberal establishment in Washington, Pence said. If Democrats keep ignoring the American people, their party's going to be history. 
Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland responded on the same show that the Congressional Budget Office reported that the House bill would reduce the deficit.
Van Hollen chided Republicans for failing to confront rising health care costs harming the U.S. economy during the years they controlled the White House and Congress.
 We 've had a great system for insurance companies, Van Hollen said, citing large industry profits as Americans face what he called unfair practices such as having coverage denied for pre-existing conditions. This is a message to the American people; we 're trying to bring down your costs to help more Americans afford health insurance. 
The House vote less than an hour before midnight Saturday was full of drama. With eight seconds left in the voting period, Democrats began counting down and erupted in roars when Pelosi declared, The bill is passed and banged the gavel.
Republican lawmakers stood silently across the floor, some with their arms folded across their chests.
 Well, it was about what I thought it would be, said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio as he quickly exited.
Later, he issued a statement saying the $1.2 trillion legislation would add to the country's skyrocketing debt.
 I came here to renew the American Dream, so my kids and their kids have the same opportunities I had, Boehner said. I came here to fight big-government monstrosities like this bill that dim the light of freedom and diminish opportunity for future generations. 
Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released an equally tersely worded statement.
 Nancy Pelosi and her liberal lieutenants made a lot of promises today to get the votes they desperately needed, he said. Make no mistake -- the Democrat leadership's assurances were based on political expediency, not principle. Anyone receiving a promise from Pelosi is guaranteed to be disappointed in the end when their votes are no longer needed. 
Earlier in the day, Obama met behind closed doors with Democrats to shore up support for the bill, calling it a chance of a generation.
In the run-up to the vote, Republicans and conservative Democrats joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to prohibit federal funds for abortion services.
It was considered a big win for them and for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which used its power -- especially with conservative Democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force Democratic leaders to permit a vote on the amendment.
The prohibition, introduced by Democratic members -- including Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana and Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan -- would exclude cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger.
The GOP accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment, with one Republican voting present. 
On the Democratsside, 64 voted for the measure, and 194 voted against.

"Noise emanating from passing ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins far more than previously thought, with new research showing that the animals' communication and ability to find prey could be hampered by the underwater din. The low rumble of passing ships has long been connected to the disturbance of large whales. But, US researchers have documented persistent noise also occurring at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best. 
These noise disturbances could be hindering the ability of killer whales to communicate and echolocate - the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. Dolphins and porpoises, which also operate at higher frequencies, may be suffering the same problems. The findings suggest that the noise could well affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes. A population of just 84 killer whales forage up the US west coast and into Puget Sound. 
""The main concern relating to this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more difficult for whales,"" said Scott Veirs of Beamreach, who led the research. ""That's worrying because their prey, chinook salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Hearing that subtle click is harder if there's a lot of noise around you."" 
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State. The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day. 
Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air - about the sound of a loud rock concert. Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels - around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner. 
Veirs said scientists have already identified the impact of underwater noise upon baleen whales - a class of fauna containing the largest animals on Earth. But, the new research underlines the threat posed to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. ""Ships have been thought of as low- frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains,"" he said. ""Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies. This could be causing a significant problem that we need to look into more."" 
There are several knock-on consequences of a noisy marine environment. Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other. And, should they fail to find prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of excess blubber. This is problematic as this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if released fully into their systems. 
Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near the cetaceans. ""It should be easy to reduce noise pollution,"" he said. ""Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be straightforward ways of transferring that technology to the commercial fleet. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half."" 
While the fortunes of some whale species, such as humpbacks and blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, have improved as whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors. The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid losing the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, a species with just 500 individuals left. 
In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals in their blubber. Scientists are still trying to determine whether pollutants caused the deaths of five sperm whales that became stranded on the east coast of Britain in January 2016. Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japan's recent pledge to resume whaling in Antarctic waters.

"The Statue of Liberty, arguably one of New York City's most iconic symbols, is a popular tourist attraction for first-time visitors to the city. This 150-foot monument was gifted to the United States from France in order to celebrate 100 years of America's independence. The statue is located on Liberty Island, and it is accessible by taking a ferry from either Battery Park in New York City or Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue's crown.
During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue's exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!
After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can't wait to return to the city in the future.",C1
"Writing in the journal Nature, former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay argues that our reliance on GPS (global positioning system) technology is misplaced and could be eroding our innate way-finding abilities. ""If we do not cherish them, our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely ever more on smart devices,"" he wrote. 
McKinlay believes huge investment will be needed before navigation systems will be good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off. In the meantime, he argues, we need better research into systems for navigation while children should be encouraged to learn how to find their way around by more traditional means. ""Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills,"" he wrote. 
According to Ofcom (the Office of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012, making GPS technology widely available. But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices. ""Navigation is a use-it-or-lose-it skill,"" he wrote. 
While few scientific studies have explored the issue, research from 2009 supports the notion. ""What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years,"" said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London, who is an author of the study. The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel. ""We were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they weren't using their knowledge on that particular test."" 
Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he is quick to point out that the biggest risk lies in users being unwittingly led into perilous situations. Among the fatalities blamed on satnavs (satellite navigation devices) was the death of a driver who, in 2010, plunged into a reservoir in Spain. ""There is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav,"" said Spiers. ""But the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known."" 
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says Spiers. While audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation, he says, the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different. ""In the old days, you had to print out or take an A to Z map in your pocket - what we are doing now is just using computer- aided information and you are having to think really quite hard about where you are going and interact with this device,"" he said. ""The modern technology isn't just dumbing us down completely."" 
McKinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become a reality. ""For really critical applications - safety applications like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft - GPS is still not good enough,"" he said. 
Though Spiers believes the development of artificial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, McKinlay remains sceptical. ""We will see ever- smarter machines which are very, very task specific, but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve,"" he said. 
Ultimately, McKinlay believes, it's essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation. ""Do you really want to encourage people to get to a point where, when it disappears or when the battery goes flat, they are in total shock and can do nothing?"" he said. ""Technology isn't magic - it is just a tool.""

"A Lufthansa jumbo jet nearly collided with another plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport Monday after an EgyptAir flight apparently veered into its path just as the jet barreled down the runway, according to air traffic controller tapes.
The near miss was captured on audio recordings, revealing an air traffic controller communicating with the Lufthansa pilot, yelling Cancel takeoff ! Cancel takeoff plans ! as the two planes moved toward each other.
The pilot of the Lufthansa jet acknowledged as the plane rolled to a halt.
Lufthansa Flight 411, an Airbus 340 packed with 286 passengers and crew, was cleared for takeoff by air traffic control shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
EgyptAir Flight 986, a Boeing 777, was issued instructions to taxi from the ramp area to the airfield for departure.
The plane was instructed to turn onto another taxiway, but instead went straight, the statement said.
A spokesman for EgyptAir said the flight was delayed 40 minutes because Lufthansa's departure was delayed.
The plane did not move until the tower issued clearance, spokesman Mohamed Rahma said.
After a brief inspection at the gate, the Lufthansa flight continued on its flight to Munich, Germany, and arrived safely, according to Lufthansa spokesman Martin Riecken.
The FAA is currently investigating the incident.

"Gary Johnson and Virgil Goode have no chance of winning the November 6 presidential election, but the two third-party candidates could have an impact on who does.
Together, Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Goode of the Constitution Party are in position to siphon a few thousand votes from Republican Mitt Romney and perhaps President Barack Obama in some of the handful of battleground states considered up for grabs and therefore decisive in determining the winner.
Goode, a former Democrat-turned-Republican congressman from Virginia known for an anti-immigration stance and other strongly conservative policies, routinely won well over 120,000 votes in his home district in elections from 1996 to 2008.
If he gets only 10 % of that support this time, it could be enough to swing what is currently considered a dead-even race for Virginia's 13 electoral votes to Obama.
Gary Johnson: An uphill battle to catch a wave, win the presidency
 Virgil Goode is a wild card, particularly in Virginia, said Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, adding he could be a factor even if he wins only a handful of votes. 
A similar scenario involves Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, in other states considered too close to call like Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire, said Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University.
All three states, with a combined 19 electoral votes, are known for independent-minded voters, she noted, enough of whom might be inclined to back a Libertarian instead of Romney.
In Nevada, a CNN/ORC International poll last month showed Goode winning 4 % support and Johnson 3 %, with Obama holding a 47 % -44 % lead over Romney in the state. Based on 2008 turnout in Nevada, the support for Goode and Johnson would amount to about 67,000 votes.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed the impact of third-party candidates earlier this month, telling CNN that Johnson's candidacy was almost a non-factor. 
Could Obama's struggles with white voters cost him the election ?
Voters are not going to throw their vote away when we have an election here that's about the future of America, Priebus said. I do n't see that happening. 
CNN polling shows that support for Obama and Romney changes little when third party candidates are factored into state races, said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.
 In all states CNN has polled so far, the minor party candidates are getting no more than 4 % of the vote, and usually closer to 1 % -2 %, Holland said, noting that including them does n't change the margin between Obama and Romney. Statistically speaking, it's difficult to make the case that the minor party candidates are affecting the race. 
The influence of third party challengers has dropped dramatically since Texas billionaire Ross Perot won almost 19 % of the vote in 1992, drawing conservative ire for harming incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush's re-election chances against Democrat Bill Clinton.
Eight years later, consumer activist and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader got 2.8 million votes, including more than 94,000 in Florida that ensured Democratic Vice President Al Gore's loss to Republican George W. Bush in the state by 537 votes.
Despite plummeting votes for third party candidates in recent elections, the tight race this year between Obama and Romney makes even fractional support for others potentially decisive in a key state, and therefore the election.
Who's up ? Check out: CNN Polling Center
 If the race is close enough, 100 votes can matter, said Scott Rasmussen, president of the polling company Rasmussen Reports. The fierce competition of this year's race means fewer undecided voters and fewer people choosing a third-party option, he noted, adding: It's not a Ross Perot year. 
Goode rejects any insinuation that he seeks to play a spoiler role, saying his policies would be better for the country than those of Obama or Romney.
If he managed to win, it would shake up Washington in that an average citizen would be president instead of someone that is backed by super-PACs, he recently told CNN.
Johnson depicts himself as more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal issues. He says same-sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal, supports legalizing marijuana usage, and also says he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service.
To Schiller, Johnson represents a possible threat that should worry the Romney campaign.
 I think you can argue that Gary Johnson will siphon off Romney votes, she told CNN, arguing that hardcore conservatives who consider the former Massachusetts governor to be too moderate could opt for the Libertarian.
Do the math: CNN Electoral Map
 If Colorado gets closer, I think it will matter if Johnson's in the race, Schiller said, noting that 1,000 or 2,000 votes from Romney -- it makes a difference. 
To counter that dynamic, Romney's campaign must make the argument that a vote for Johnson is the same as voting for Obama, according to Schiller.
 Any time you have a third party in a very tight race and that third party candidate seems a lot more like Romney than he does Obama, then if you 're Romney, you have to discredit that candidate, she said.
However, Johnson's campaign told CNN in September that some of the candidate's support came from former Obama supporters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.
By running as the Libertarian Party candidate, Johnson hoped to gain the support of the relatively small but fiercely loyal following of Ron Paul, the Texas congressman who has failed in three bids to win the Republican presidential nomination. So far, the polling suggests little progress by Johnson in winning over Paul's supporters.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey earlier this month in Virginia showed 1 % of likely voters -- about 38,000 based on the 2008 turnout in the state -- supported an unspecified candidate other than Obama or Romney. The bulk of that support appeared to be from strongly liberal or moderate younger voters, a demographic closer to Obama's base.
Obama could get hurt by two other minor party candidates -- Jill Stein of the Green Party and Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party -- but both are considered far less likely to get enough support to undermine the president.
A CNN/ORC national poll at the end of September showed Stein with 3 % compared to 4 % for Johnson, while Goode and Anderson had negligible support. However, Stein failed to register in CNN/ORC polls in recent weeks in Florida and Nevada, and she got 1 % support in Ohio compared to 3 % for Johnson.
According to Schiller, possible voter apathy by liberals disappointed with Obama's first term helped motivate the president's campaign to mount a huge effort to boost turnout both in early voting and on Election Day.
 I think they understood they had to get the people who would definitely vote for Obama to the polls, period, with no wavering and no indecision, she said.
CNN's Holland warned against assuming supporters of third party candidates changed their mind from a major party contender.
 Minor party supporters usually fall into that category because they do n't like the two major party candidates, he said. So in a hypothetical world in which the race were only between the two major party candidates, a lot of minor party voters would have just stayed at home. 
The other candidates, the other debate

"Perhaps no other name in daytime variety shows brings out more emotion than Jerry Springer. Springer has been a talk show host for several years on the show that bears his name, the Jerry Springer Show. His show is described as a tabloid talk show because of the controversial subjects covered, and because of the people who appear on the show. Springer does not invite celebrities to his show. Instead, he opts to showcase regular Americans from all walks of life. He is a former politician who served one term as mayor of the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1970s.
 
His show debuted in 1991 as a politically themed talk show, where he invited celebrities such as Oliver North, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. The show was designed to mimic another popular daytime talk show, the Phil Donahue show. The show found moderate success, but in 1994, in order to boost ratings, the show transitioned to a more sensational format. In this new format, everyday people were confronted by family members, and friends, about controversial subjects.
The show has been highly-rated for decades now, but has also come under fire from many groups who claim the subjects are not appropriate for daytime television. Springer does not shy away from any subject. Guests are confronted about subjects such as adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, and hate group membership. Often, these confrontations become violent, where guests engaged in physical confrontations. The Springer show has spawned numerous copycat shows over the years, but it still out-rates every other show of its kind.
In May of 2000, controversy hit the show when a female guest on the Springer show was murdered by her ex-husband after viewing the episode. Springer, his producer, and the network were sued by the woman's children. The suit alleged that the controversial nature of the show led to the murder, eventually though, the suit was dropped.",C1
"It's a slick production with a nefarious goal: A 55-minute video released by ISIS, praising its victories and warning the United States from getting in the way of its goal to create an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.
It's propaganda, terrorism experts say. A recruitment video aimed at English speakers.
But the U.S. intelligence community is focused on one jihadist who appears briefly at the end of the video. The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men.
It is too early to know if this militant hails from North America, or maybe spent some time there, or what his exact story might be.
But the intelligence community is already analyzing the video in an attempt to identify the man's origin, a U.S. official told CNN. It is too early to tell where his dialect is from, the official said.
In the video titled Flames of War, the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.
But the ISIS fighter -- who is masked and wearing a camouflage uniform -- seamlessly switches to English. There are a number of men digging a ditch behind him. The jihadist claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who now, after an ISIS attack, are digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed. 
CNN can not independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propaganda video claims.
How the Islamic Stateis run, from oil to beheadings
The video then shows a group of militants executing the men, who fall into the ditch.
The man who committed this atrocity on film could be an Arab who was educated in the West. Or he could be an American or Canadian. If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera.
 Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera, said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. Why ? Because he seems American. The message is aimed at a Western audience. 
The intent, Cilluffo told CNN, is to project fear to Americans, and to project power.
The difference between ISIS and al Qaeda
Intelligence officials will sift through every detail of the man's voice, looking for any clues of a particular dialect that might lead investigators to local communities to seek additional clues, Cilluffo said.
The U.S. will also compare the clues of the jihadist's language to see whether it is consistent with those individuals who are known to have gone to fight for ISIS.
The video is undoubtedly propaganda and a recruitment piece for the terrorist group, Cruickshank said. But it is also a warning to the West that if it gets involved in the fight, it will be a tough outing for foreign troops.
The video does n't exactly goad the United States and the West into launching attacks against ISIS, but those who appear in the video try to convey a sense of toughness, Cruickshank said.
The video glamorizes ISIS, according to SITE Intelligence, which monitors terrorist groups.
 It serves as not only a powerful recruitment piece, but a stern warning to their opposition about flames of warrising against them by the fighters, according to a summary by SITE.

"In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves.
We 've witnessed the warmest spring since record-keeping began in 1895.
Thirty-one states reached record-high temperatures.
The period between July 2011 and June 2012 was the hottest 12 months on record.
And last year 14 extreme weather-related events caused an incalculable loss of human life and cost the U.S. economy more than $55 billion. Understandably, many Americans are wondering if these events are manifestations of a longer-term shift in climate.
At present we can not definitively link any single extreme event to climate change. But it is worthwhile to consider whether the apparent increase in some extreme events has roots in a larger, longer-term trend, since that would predict a continuation of these events in the future.
That kind of understanding can have practical importance because it can inspire action to reduce economic losses and human suffering a $ often in relatively simple ways. If a region is likely to continue to get rainfall heavier than has historically occurred, for example, then it is sensible for city planners to consider installing larger-bore storm sewers when the time comes to replace aging infrastructure.
The science in this area is getting stronger all the time. In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events. In six of the seven, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that climate change caused by human activities played a factor in the events a $ affecting their severity, likelihood or frequency.
News: Extreme weather -- get ready to see more of it
Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England. On the other hand, the study found no evidence that the devastating floods in Thailand last year were connected to climate change.
Another new peer-reviewed article, the 2011 State of the Climate report compiled by nearly 400 scientists from 48 countries, documents some of the longer-term trends that are underlying some of these changes. It found that:
-- Carbon dioxide and other major greenhouse gases continue to climb, with the 2011 yearly global average the highest yet;
-- Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making oceans more acidic;
-- The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and its sea ice is thinning dramatically;
-- And the globally averaged heat stored in the upper ocean was the highest since records began in 1993.
Such striking trends have strong implications for climate, weather and environmental and human health.
One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events. Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season. Emergency managers along the Mississippi, Missouri and Red River basins used NOAA climate data to help lessen flooding, months before it began.
Coastal managers are using sea-level-rise data to protect crucial infrastructure.
Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments.
Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed.
These are the kinds of practical actions that inspire me in my job as we work to make the best science available to understand and reduce the impact of extreme events on families, communities and businesses. These and other measures are essential to reducing the effects of extreme weather events and forging a safer future.

"Under Christmas trees around the world, parcels of underpants and bundles of briefs are waiting to be opened -- perhaps with a tinge of dismay -- by the men in your life.
Underwear is a big hitter on the traditional holiday gift list and now soccer stars are muscling into the market.
Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez became the latest footballer to tackle branded underwear, launching his J10 collection for Bronzini last month and posing semi-naked to show off the goods on offer.
The 23-year-old was following the lead of his Portuguese Real Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, whose CR7 underwear label recently celebrated its one-year anniversary.
David Beckham's pants hit high streets in close to 40 countries when the former LA Galaxy and Manchester United maestro teamed up with Swedish fashion store H&M in 2012.
Even though he is approaching 40 -- that's 17 years older than undies rival Rodriguez -- Beckham stripped off again this summer to model his wares.
But why do footballers choose to branch out their brand in the most intimate way ?
 Christmas comes round once a year but footballers are in the shop window continually, Steve Martin, the global CEO for brand agency M&C Saatchi Sport and Entertainment, told CNN.
 Underwear is an every day purchase and wearing the right underwear has seen it become something of a lifestyle item.
 For some of the major players, it's a natural extension of their individual brand.
 They do n't need the money. It's not about greed but it is about making the most of their true value over the short period of their career. 
Martin helps manage the branding and marketing for Ronaldo's CR7 range, which he says is available in almost 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern Europe, Asia and South America -- as well as online.
Ronaldo's luxury trunks cost $36 a pair with the briefs priced at $30 but he also stocks a basic line where trunks are $30 and briefs $17.
 The core audience -LSB- for the CR7 range -RSB- is football fans who aspire to Ronaldo's look and image, Martin adds. The age range is mainly 18-24 year olds and slightly older.
 The beauty of Ronaldo is that he cuts across quite a big demographic. 
The aesthetic allure of Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Beckham is an undeniable factor in why their underwear packs a punch.
Beckham stopped traffic as an underwear model for Emporio Armani before collaborating with H&M while the perfectly manicured Ronaldo oozes style on and off the pitch.
Rodriguez may still be baby faced but he is already winning awards for his looks, voted the world's sexiest man in 2014 by Spain's People magazine.
When this handsome trio launched their underwear collections, they not only appealed to football fans but to their gift buying wives, girlfriends and mothers too.
 I 'm sure H&M chose David Beckham because he's a very attractive, fit fellow, Seth Stevenson, New York based senior writer for Slate, told CNN.
 They also chose him because he has appeal in a lot of different places. He's famous in Asia, he's well known in the U.S. and he's married to Victoria Beckham.
 He's got some profile all over the world and they 've got stores all over the world.
 Celebrities are a popular advertising gambit because people are interested in celebrities and like to do what they do. 
The pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was, however, not a footballer but Swedish tennis ace Bjorn Borg.
After his sudden retirement from the game in 1983 at the age of just 26, the 11-time grand slam singles champion served up another winner by launching his eponymous underwear brand in 1984.
The company now sells around five million items of underwear across its male and female ranges each year and is stocked in 20 global markets.
 The Bjorn Borg name is a very strong part of this success, says the company's marketing and communications manager Jonas Lindberg Nyvang.
 He's still involved in that he comes to the office, he's informed about what we do and he's still part of the process. 
Borg's dashing good looks, like those of Beckham, Ronaldo and Rodriguez, certainly helped him cut a dash in the underwear market but sustaining a successful brand over 30 years relies on more than superficial appeal.
Sports stars arguably make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the go.
 If you have the right underwear you feel more confidence on the court or off the court, explains Nyvang. It's important for sporting performance.
 At Bjorn Borg we focus on the perfect fit and we are also very fashion conscious. We put out underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive. 
But before you dream about wrapping up a Nigel de Jong thong or a pair of Neymar knickers for your loved ones, bear in mind it takes a certain type of star to make money from undies.
 You are talking about one-offs here, says Martin. There are probably only a handful of global sports stars that can attempt something like this.
 For every Ronaldo there are thousands and thousands and thousands of footballers who do n't make a thousandth of what he does. 
Stevenson agrees that true sporting icons stand a better chance of successfully creating a product line that is not directly connected to their core business -- but that even then there could be pit falls.

Language	Number of people learning the language	Number of native speakers	Number of countries where the language is spoken
English	1.5 billion	527 million	101
French	82 million	118 million	51
Chinese	30 million	1.39 billion	33
Spanish	14.5 million	389 million	31
Italian	8 million	67 million	29
Japanese	3 million	123 million	25
The table illustrates some interesting facts about some of the world's most popular languages to learn. It allows comparisons between the number of people who study a language versus those who speak it as a mother tongue, and shows how many countries have speakers of each of the languages.
The prominence of English is striking. 1.5 billion people are learning English compared to only 82 million studying the second most popular language to learn, French. English is spoken in 101 countries, roughly twice as many as French and three times more than Chinese. English is the only language with more learners than native speakers.
In terms of native speakers, Chinese is the most spoken language, more than double English with 1.39 billion. It is the third most popular language to learn with 30 million learners. Spanish has over five times more native speakers than Italian, but proportionally fewer learners at 14.5 million for Spanish and 8 million for Italian. As for Japanese, it is the least studied language of those given with 3 million learners.
Overall, more people are learning English than the other languages combined and English is spoken in the highest number of countries. However, Chinese has by far the greatest number of native speakers. There seems to be little correlation between how many native speakers there are of a language and the number of learners, but there is a stronger link between the number of learners and how many countries have speakers.",C1
"A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say.
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content -LRB- BAC -RRB- cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.
 Most Americans think that we 've solved the problem of impaired driving, but in fact, it's still a national epidemic, NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said.
The idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the United States.
NTSB looks to technology to end drunken driving in the U.S.
Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy. But she said too many people are still dying on America's roads.
The board acknowledged that there was no silver bullet, but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels.
 In the last 30 years, more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol-impaired driving. What will be our legacy 30 years from now ? Hersman asked. If we do n't tackle alcohol-impaired driving now, when will we find the will to do so ? 
Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board said.
Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period, according to the calculator.
Supreme Court rules against police in drunk driving case
Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel.
The NTSB investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues. It can not impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress.
But the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like-minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide. States set their own BAC standards.
The board also recommended on Tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits.
And it is pushing for laws requiring all first-time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed.
In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication.
But over the next 24 years, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard, the last state falling in line in 2004.
The number of alcohol-related highway fatalities, meanwhile, dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011, the NTSB said.
Drunk-drive blood tests divide Supreme Court
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
 I think.05 is going to come. How long it takes to get there, we do n't know. But it will happen, said the NTSB's Robert Molloy, who helped guide the staff report.
For some, the vote struck close to home.
NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15-year sentence in a related death.
Many of the recommendations are going to be unpopular, Sumwalt said. But if we keep doing what we 're doing, we 're not going to make any difference. 
The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05.
Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.
The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.
CDC: Teen drinking and driving rates cut in half
A restaurant trade association, the American Beverage Institute, attacked the main recommendation, saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming one drink. The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -LRB- NHTSA -RRB-.
But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday it no longer uses that chart as there are many variables that contribute to an individual's level of intoxication. A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, -LRB- and -RRB- reduced response to emergency driving situations. 
A beer industry trade group said it would examine NTSB's recommendation for lowering the blood-alcohol threshold.
 However, we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results: by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with BAC of -LRB- 0.15 -RRB- or more, said Joe McClain, president of the Beer Institute.
The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.
NHTSA, which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data, said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower BAC standard to gather further information on that approach. 
At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.
Some 40 states already use the administrative tool, which the NTSB believes is effective because it is swift and immediate.
And the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors, which police can use to sniff the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol.
The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints. If the sensor alerts, it is grounds for more thorough testing.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
Tuesday's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related crash in U.S. history. On May 14, 1988, a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Kentucky. The truck hit a school bus, killing 24 children and three adults. More than 30 others were hurt.

"You can be Aagot, Arney or Asfri(U+00F0)ur; Baldey, Bebba or Bra. Dogg, Dimmbla, Etna and Eybjort are fine; likewise Frigg, Glodis, Horn and Ingunn. Jorlaug works OK, as do Obba, Sigurfljo(U+00F0), Urania and - should you choose - Vagna. But you cannot, as a girl in Iceland, be called Harriet. 
""The whole situation,"" said Tristan Cardew, with very British understatement, ""is really rather silly."" With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriet's passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name. 
Since the registry does not recognize the name of Harriet's 12-year-old brother, Duncan, either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as Stulka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. ""But, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,"" Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to Iceland in 2000, said. ""And that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name."" 
The impasse meant the family, from Kopavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave. 
Names matter in Iceland, a country of barely 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your father's (or mother's) son or daughter. Jon Einarsson's offspring, for example, might be Olafur Jonsson and Sigri(U+00F0)ur Jonsdottir. 
The law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must - unless both parents are foreign - be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee. 
For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas. Among its requirements are that given names must be ""capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings"", may not ""conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland"" and should be ""written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography"". 
What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland's 32-letter alphabet, such as ""c "", are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. ""That was the problem with Harriet,"" said Cardew. 
The country's naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Blaer - ""Light Breeze"" - Bjarkardottir Runarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to ""Girl"", when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, Jon Gnarr, has also called Iceland's naming law ""unfair, stupid and against creativity"". 
The Cardews could get round Harriet's problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. ""But it's a bit late for that and way too silly,"" said Cardew. ""Are they saying they don't want us here?""",C1
"How far away are we from a world where drones deliver packages? If Amazon is to be believed, not far at all. Others are not so sure: technical progress past this point isn't merely a matter of invention; it's a matter of public safety. 
Paul Misener, Amazon's vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place - but Misener gave no hints as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman that there was a basket of fresh fruit on the way to his doorstep to demonstrate the technology's viability. 
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren't airway-legal at all yet - only drones up to 25kg will be covered and the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you're going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack. Professor Sajiv Singh of Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, who runs a ""critical cargo delivery"" company called NearEarth, said that piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. But even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said. 
""They're not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they're proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area or a suburban area,"" he said. ""In those particular cases, there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect. Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn't know about, unless you've mapped that exact route before. Even then, maybe there's construction equipment that wasn't there but is there now. Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case it's going to have an incorrect idea about where it is."" All this is surmountable, he said - but it's difficult. One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. ""If you have an off-the-shelf UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle], it'll just keep going and crash into the ground,"" said roboticist Daniel Huber. 
That's not a hard problem for an engineer to fix; it's just that the fix isn't yet an industry standard. 
Furthermore, ""you can't do everything with a 25kg aircraft"", said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor Lockheed Martin MST. Much of the focus at Lockheed Martin has been on making drone piloting interfaces less like elaborate flight simulators. ""Those of us in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesn't really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,"" he said. ""Operators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop."" ""Technologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,"" said Huber. 
He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure - pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. ""We've developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it'll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back."" 
Huber, a senior scientist at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, where he works on 3D systems imagery, said with respect to a program like Amazon's: ""I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight - a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance."" It's one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. ""The larger you get, the more dangerous you get."" Logistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways, Huber said. At a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone firm, SkyCatch, demonstrated a robot that could autonomously take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station. ""It would land and take off and, when it ran low on batteries, it would land, exchange the batteries and take off again,"" he said. 
Of course, safety remains a major concern - Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every 1m hours. Drones, he said, are ""one or two orders of magnitude away"" from that benchmark. ""The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,"" Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, doesn't count as catastrophic failure - something has to fall out of the sky. ""We're closing the gap,"" Singh said. ""There's a lot of interest."" 
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher. ""If you fly commercial airlines, often they'll say, 'Oh, a component has failed - we have to go back to the gate,'"" Singh said. ""And that's an established industry with 60 years of legacy! I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway."" Part of the solution, Singh said, is simple contingency planning: ""If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.""

" 7-Eleven killed the minibar. 
The sentiments of one hotel manager in Hong Kong could well extend to hotels around the world.
The hotel minibar, loved and cursed at by millions of desperate midnight snackers/drinkers, is on the decline.
Hilton Hong Kong installed the world's first hotel minibar in 1974 by stocking liquors and fridges in each of its 840 rooms.
The move reportedly led to a 500 % increase in room-service drink sales and a 5 % boost to the company's net income that year.
Soon, the minibar became a near-universal industry standard.
But Hilton recently started backtracking in some of its properties, removing the booze and leaving the fridges in its rooms, for guests to fill themselves.
Other hotel giants, including the Grand Hyatt, Starwood and Marriott brands, are also phasing out this once ubiquitous in-room feature from some of their properties.
It's because we just do n't seem to enjoy them as much as we once did.
TripAdvisor recently released a survey that found the minibar ranked least popular among all hotel amenities -- just 21 % of respondents found the room fridge an important feature compared with 89 % that wanted a free wireless connection.
PKF Hospitality Research found that in the United States, revenue from minibars, which represents just 1 % of total hotel revenue, fell 28 % from 2007 to 2012.
Robert Mandelbaum, the firm's director of research information services, says properties in the United States have adapted their food and beverage offerings, installing food outlets that resemble grab and go mini-markets.
The trend for convenience eating is also contributing to a decline in the traditional hotel restaurant that serves three meals a day, he says.
They 're being replaced with casual food outlets offering items such as pre-packaged salads.
It's all part of what Mandelbaum calls the Starbucks phenomenon, a property design and management philosophy that enables and encourages interaction between strangers.
Combine this with the emergence of sociable millennials who prefer to mingle in the hotel lobby than order room service, and you have an industry and consumer move away from imbibing in the room.
Is this such a bad thing ?
For those who think inflated prices on items like tiny bags of macadamia nuts and mediocre chocolate bars are offensive, especially when nearby convenience stores offer the same stuff for a fraction of the price, the stocked in-room bar has always been an irritant.
Simon Dell, vice president of operations of Thailand-based ONYX Hospitality Group, agrees.
 We do n't want to sell mini-macadamia nuts for $8.50. It's not what people want, he says.
What's more, by eliminating minibars from rooms, hotels can actually save costs, says Dell.
 When -LRB- we -RRB- remove any content from the minibar it takes a considerable number of tasks out of every -LRB- housekeeper's -RRB- day, so there's time saved, headcount saved, therefore money saved, which is reflected in the overall price -LRB- of rooms -RRB-, he says.
Better for a property to focus on amenities guests prioritize, such as Internet access.
 Connectivity is as ubiquitous as the telephone 20 years ago, when it had to be in the room, or like your own shower or bathroom has to be in the room. 
$10 Coke not right '
Others think the minibar simply needs to evolve to changing needs of guests.
 We ca n't just give hot and cold running water, says Dean Winter, area director of operations of Hong Kong Hotels & China Projects at Swire Hotels.
Take the example of Swire's Hong Kong property, Upper House -- each room features a complimentary selection -LRB- beer, soda, healthy juices, coconut water and snacks -RRB- and a separate, chargeable wine fridge.
 We wanted to differentiate ourselves to appeal to discerning business and leisure travelers without following the traditional routes of five-star hospitality, explains Winter.
He thinks charging $5-10 for Coke is not the right thing to do, as people remain price conscious.
 People appreciate a complimentary minibar or Wi-Fi or movies, and paying a rate and not all these add-ons, he says.
Less hard booze
Today there's far less hard liquor, complimentary or not.
Ten years ago, JW Marriott yanked the petite bottles of liquor out of its chargeable minibars in its Hong Kong hotel, citing low consumption.
At The Mira Hong Kong, miniature spirits were phased out in 2011.
According to the property, the hard liquor was removed as we prefer to tempt our guests with drinks and entertainment at our open air lounge bar Vibes, and cocktail bar Room One with a live band. 
Only corporate or high-paying guests get the fully complimentary minibar.
Cheap trumps convenient
The minibar is also increasingly part of an all-inclusive package.
At Hong Kong's Ovolo Hotel, the complimentary scheme is extensive: guests get a free minibar, breakfasts, plus two-hours free booze daily at its O Lounge, including all spirits and wine.
Removing the prices has also helped remove the headache of arguing with guests over what exactly they did or did not consume, says the hotel manager in Ovolo's Aberdeen branch, Chum Roa.
 It was a source of many disputes in hotels, he says. If the customer persists they had nothing, often hotels absorb the cost to not ruin guest relations over minibar items. 
Now, he does n't have to deal with that.
Roa imagines a future in which the traditional minibar is extinct.
 The competitor of the minibar is n't nearby hotels but the 24-hour stores where one can get everything you need a few blocks away, he says.
The convenience of having a cold drink in your room is n't quite enough if you have to pay three times as much for it, it seems.
Will you miss minibars in hotel rooms or say good riddance to shockingly priced beer and M&M's ? Leave a comment.

"Sen. Tim Kaine said Wednesday there's no legal authority for the current U.S. mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
 We have been engaged in a war -- that is not about imminent defense of the United States -- without legal authority, the Virginia Democrat said at the Wilson Center on Wednesday, ahead of a panel discussion on the legal authority for military intervention, moderated by CNN's Jim Sciutto.
The mission is not covered by either the wording or intent of the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force as the White House argues, Kaine said, adding that such an argument is ridiculous and inconsistent with President Barack Obama's previously stated interpretation of the AUMF.
Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has proposed a new, limited authorization, specifically targeted to the current mission against ISIS. We should deal with it right away, he said, stressing that it could be accomplished in the lame-duck session in Congress.
Rand Paul on ISIS response: This war is now illegal '
He's also calling for changes to the War Powers Resolution that will result in a better process for war authorization.
In a statement last week, Kaine said he was encouraged by Obama's recent willingness to work with Congress on a new authorization, but also troubled by suggestions today that Congress should wait until the new Congressional session in 2015 to take this vote. 
 We have already asked too many U.S. service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission, he added.
What to expect from the lame duck Congress
The current AUMF was passed in 2001, just days after the 9/11 attacks. Though the language of the authorization only covers military action against those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in recent years it has been used to cover action against any group or individual the administration considers associated with al Qaeda.
A second authorization for use of military force against Iraq was passed in 2002, permitting the president to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.

"On an average day its outlets are a hive of social activity, hosting everything from business meetings to reading groups looking for that all-important morning caffeine rush. But Starbucks should be careful what it wishes for. 
The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empire's UK branches into creches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight the chain's tax avoidance tactics. 
The announcement of the action comes on the day a Starbucks executive faces questions from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee over why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years, despite senior US management trumpeting the company's profitable operations in Britain. 
In his appearance before the committee, Starbucks' Chief Financial Officer, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the company's reputation, which continues to suffer because of the controversy. 
MPs accused HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) officials of having cosy relationships with big businesses. Speaking about the arrangements with Starbucks, the Conservative MP Richard Bacon said: ""It smells. And it doesn't smell of coffee - it smells bad."" 
The campaign group UK Uncut is attempting to draw a link between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses. 
Sarah Greene, a UK Uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres faced cuts unless companies paid their fair share of tax. HMRC estimates around GBP32bn was lost to tax avoidance in 2011. 
Greene said the government could easily bring in billions that could fund vital services by clamping down on tax avoidance. 
The group, which rose to prominence after staging a sit-in at Vodafone stores, Topshop and Fortnum & Mason, turned its attentions to Starbucks last month after an investigation by Reuters discovered the company had paid only GBP8.6m in corporation tax since launching in the UK in 1998, despite cumulative sales of GBP3bn. 
Longstanding Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said ""We've chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. So there is going to be a real focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that are being cut by the government ... [such as] refuges and creches. 
""Starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and that's what UK Uncut finds really important: people can take action in their local areas,"" she said. 
Several international organizations have faced criticism over their UK accounts, with Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google and Ikea all paying little or no corporation tax despite large British operations. 
However, according to pollsters at YouGov's BrandIndex, Starbucks has suffered the deepest damage to its image. 
The coffee store chain insists it pays the correct level of taxes. The group Chief Executive, Howard Schultz, has said in a statement: ""Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary. 
""Over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than GBP160m in various taxes, including National Insurance contributions, VAT and business rates."" 
Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly GBP900m of tax. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, responded to the claim by saying: ""I'm not happy with the current situation. I think [HMRC] needs to look at it very carefully. We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country as they are, but they should be paying fair taxes as well."" 
A spokeswoman for Starbucks said: ""While the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and complies with tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK - a market that we remain committed to for the long term. We've posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website. 
""Starbucks' economic impact in the UK goes far beyond our stores and partners [employees]. We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. When you take into account the indirect employment created by Starbucks' investments in the UK, the company's extended economic impact to the UK economy exceeds GBP80m annually. 
""We hope that UK Uncut will respect the wellbeing of our partners and customers, and recognize the value that we add to the economy, creating jobs and apprenticeships, as well as paying our fair share of taxes in the UK.""

"We each spend an average of three years of our lives sitting on them, King George II of Great Britain died while on his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one.
The humble lavatory is the unlikely subject of global celebration on Monday, as one of the world's most essential inventions but one that too many people still struggle without.
Although many of us tend to take ours for granted, campaigners hope that World Toilet Day 2012 will draw attention to what they 're calling the global sanitation crisis, with over a third of people worldwide living without a clean and private place to go.
This means that one in three people still have to defecate in the open, using fields or bushes, rivers, railway lines or roadsides, or simply a plastic bag. Others use unsanitary latrines or disease-ridden and foul-smelling buckets.
The majority of those without access to a toilet live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, with over half of people in Asia not having proper sanitation, according to the UK-based charity, WaterAid.
Ajara lives in a slum in the city of Gwalior in the Madhya Pradesh province of India. She told WaterAid how people in her community have to defecate on a nearby hilltop.
 There are no trees and privacy at the moment and so we have to wait until night to go there. It's difficult for old people to go and it's hard to go at night. It's also hard for grown-up girls because of the risk of sexual attack, Ajara said.
This World Toilet Day, international aid agencies are highlighting the particular risks to women of poor access to toilets. WaterAid says women are most vulnerable because they 're not only exposed to disease, but also have additional shame, harassment and risk of attack when they go out in the open.
Sandimhia Renato in Mozambique described to WaterAid how she has to cross a very dangerous bridge every time she goes to the bush to defecate.
 I think it takes 15 minutes to get to the bridge, Renato says. I come here once a day, between 4 and 5 pm. At night it is very dangerous. People get killed. A woman and a boy were killed with knives. One woman I know of has been raped. 
But it's not just the shame and inconvenience of having no private place to go to the toilet, but a huge public health issue.
When you consider that one gram of faeces can contain 10 million viruses, one million bacteria, one thousand parasite cysts and one hundred worm eggs -LRB- according to UNICEF -RRB- you can see why open defecation is so harmful to a community's health. Without a sewerage system to remove human waste and make it safe, cholera, typhoid and other infectious diseases spread quickly.
The United Nations says more than 2.7 million people die each year due to lack of sanitation. With diarrhoeal diseases killing more young children in developing countries than HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles put together, it's the second biggest cause of death in under fives, according to the World Health Organization.
Tackling it, says the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program, is extremely cost effective. It estimates that poor sanitation costs African countries around $5.5 billion a year and $53.8 billion in India is lost through associated economic impacts.
The program's study of 18 African countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discrete location to use the toilet accounted for almost $500 million in economic losses. That's before you examine the cost of healthcare, premature deaths and lost workdays due to illness.
In fact, according to the World Toilet Day organization, every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of five dollars. Its message is that the solution to the global sanitation crisis lies not in any miraculous technological breakthroughs but in stronger political leadership and a commitment to invest in sanitation infrastructure and education.
Mahatma Gandhi for one seemed to recognized the value of the toilet to humanity when he said Sanitation is more important than independence. Campaigners for World Toilet Day will be hoping that these words resonate with today's leaders.

"Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday.
Davydenko had dispatched world number one Roger Federer in the semifinals and re-produced the magic to see off the Argentine 6-3 6-4 in one hour and 23 minutes at the O2 Arena.
The victory in the elite, eight-man end-of-season showpiece is the highlight of the 28-year-old Russian's career, going one better than 2008 when he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic of Serbia.
Davydenko, seeded sixth, had begun the week with a thrilling three-set loss to Djokovic in round-robin play, but proceeded to rack up four straight victories, culminating in his emphatic win over fifth-ranked Del Potro.
It earned him $1.5 million and he was delighted to have captured the first major trophy of a career marked by consistency but mostly in a support role to the game's very elite.
 For me it was amazing coming here number seven and winning the tournament. I surprised myself, he said.
Del Potro looked weary after his epic three-set semifinal win over Swede Robin Soderling the previous night.
He dropped his service in the fourth ganme of the opening set and could claim only five points on his opponent's service as the Russian eased to an early lead.
The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game.
But at 4-4 Davydenko made his move on Del Potro's service.
Two blistering passing shots set up three break points and he claimed a 5-4 lead after a long rally.
Serving for the title, he set up match point with an ace and took it when Del Potro could not return a fiece smash.
It capped a week of surprises at the new venue with world number two Rafael Nadal crashing out with three straight sets defeats and home hope Andy Murray edged out of the round-robin by Federer and Del Potro by the slimmest of margins.
Soderling, who only came into the tournament as a late reserve for the injured Andy Roddick, and Davydenko were the surprise qualifiers from the other group, with the latter going all the way after beating the Australian, French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon champions.
Del Potro acknowledged he had been beaten by the better man on the day.
 Congratulations. You are a great champion, he said.
Now Davydenko will eye his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, which will be the next major tournament test for the leading players.
Earlier, In the doubles final, American pair Bob and Mike Bryan beat Max Mirnyi and Andy Ram 7-6 6-3 to win their third ATP Finals title and claim the number one ranking in the world at the end of the season for the fifth time.

"Camping is a popular way for many people in the United States to spend their vacation. Camping involves people leaving the comfort of their home and driving to spend a few nights or more in the great outdoors.
 
When people camp, they can sleep in a tent, a camper, or if they want to be fancier, they can sleep in a cabin. Some people like to really ""rough it"" and use no shelter except for a sleeping bag and sleep under the stars. Some people drive across the U.S. in what is known as a recreational vehicle or RV, which is a trailer. Inside there are beds, a tiny bathroom and a kitchen.
There are campgrounds all over the United States. These are places where campers gather together and usually pay a fee to pitch a tent or place a camper in a designated outdoor spot. Many of these campgrounds have water hoses and electric hookups so that people can wash dishes and themselves and plug in a radio or their computers. Most campsites also have a fire ring or pit, which is a hole in the ground where people can safely make a fire for roasting marshmallows, a popular camping activity. There usually is also a picnic table for people to eat their meals. Many of these campgrounds also have shared bathrooms complete with showers. Some campgrounds have playgrounds, pools, and game rooms. Some also organize activities for people who like sing-alongs, where people will gather together and sing songs. Usually it is illegal to camp in a place not designated as an official campsite, meaning you can't just pitch a tent in a forest.
When people go camping they often do other outdoor activities like fishing, canoeing, hiking, kayaking, swimming, horseback riding and mountain biking.",C1
"Himalayan lakes, spacewalks and the presidential primaries helped Scott Kelly keep his wits over 340 days in space, the astronaut told journalists, after he landed back on Earth from a record-setting mission. ""It seemed like I lived there forever,"" Kelly said. The veteran of past missions said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt. ""Maybe, occasionally, you do go bananas,"" he said. 
Kelly and a Russian counterpart, Mikhail Kornienko, spent nearly a year on the International Space Station (ISS) in order to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped quarters of spaceflight on humans - research NASA considers essential for an eventual mission to Mars. 
Kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt significantly more sore on returning to gravity than after shorter trips. Kelly and his twin brother, Mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests. The tests will continue, to help NASA learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of spaceflight. 
Kelly said he felt aches and had extremely sensitive skin but, so far, his balance has felt mostly decent. However, he said, ""the first thing I tried to throw on a table I missed"" because ""you tend to underestimate the effects of gravity"". 
He said the discomfort of returning to gravity - which shrank him back down to normal height after he stretched by 1.5 inches in orbit - took nothing away from the awe he felt after his capsule landed back on Earth. When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan, Kelly said, he smelled ""a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area"". It was the fresh air mingled with the charred, ""kind of sweet"" smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere. 
Backing away from the vessel, he said, the scope of the mission began to sink in: 340 days on a 15-year-old space station which is ""a million pounds, the size of a football field, the internal volume, some say, of a six-bedroom house "". The ISS, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of taxpayers. 
""There are things we're going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we don't even know now,"" Kelly said, comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at NASA in the 1960s and 1970s. He added: ""The view is great, too."" 
Kelly made the most of that view, posting spectacular photos on social media of the Earth's cities, landscapes, oceans and atmosphere. ""The Earth is a beautiful planet,"" he said, describing the striking colours of the waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow hues of lakes that dot the northern Himalayas. He said he would like to visit that region, though he would first need to learn ""what country actually owns them"". But, ""predominantly, you just notice how thin the atmosphere is, how fragile it looks,"" Kelly added. ""That, combined with these large swathes of pollution, is kind of alarming."" 
The astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution: smoke clouds from wildfires that covered parts of the US, sections of Asia with continuous, visible pollution nearly all year round. He said the message ""we need to save the planet"" slightly missed the point: ""The planet will get better; it's us that won't be here because we'll destroy the environment."" The world's thin shield of atmosphere ""makes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down"", he said. 
""It's for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. And I do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to."" Kelly's active social- media life, which he said was a joint effort with his girlfriend, earned him a huge online following. But he said he was unaware of it, instead he was watching the chaotic drama of the 2016 presidential election. One of the first questions he asked the crew who lifted him out of a space capsule was ""How did Super Tuesday go?"" 
But the astronaut demurred when asked for his thoughts on the likes of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. ""I would say that, as a government employee, I am subject to the Hatch Act,"" he said, referring to a law that prohibits some political activity for federal employees. ""So I can't say how I think of all the news stories of all the year."" 
Besides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: ""I tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next robotics, the next science experiment. That made a difference to me, keeping my sanity."" Being back on Earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in, he added, recalling how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission. ""There'll be a point here pretty soon where I'll start feeling that kind of culture shock,"" he said. 
Although a NASA scientist said Kelly embodied the qualities needed for a mission to Mars, the astronaut himself predicted that he would not fly again with the space agency. ""But I don't think I would ever say I'm absolutely, 100% done,"" he added, noting the sudden successes of private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX. ""They might need a guy like me someday,"" he said. ""Maybe, in the next 20 years, you'll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.""

"One of the most controversial figures in the history of the United States of America was Dr. Jack Kevorkian. He was a pathologist, euthanasia advocate, and author, who came into fame during the late 1990s. He died in 2011. Kevorkian was a firm believer in euthanasia for the terminally ill. He designed a suicide machine that helped 130 people end their lives. Kevorkian was persecuted throughout his career as a suicide facilitator, and was convicted in 1999 for his involvement in an assisted suicide. He served eight years in prison, and was released in 2007 after agreeing to no longer assist with anyone's suicide.
 
Kevorkian had a difficult time working as a pathologist at the University of Michigan, where he earned his doctorate degree. He did not see eye to eye with his employers, and chose to leave the hospital to pursue his own interests. In 1987, Kevorkian purchased advertising space in Detroit newspapers as a ""death consultant."" His first known assisted suicide was for a 54-year-old woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Kevorkian was not charged in the case because Michigan did not have a law in place regarding assisted suicide. The state did file murder charges initially, but those charges were dropped. The Michigan Medical Board, however, did strip Kevorkian of his medical practitioner's license.
Kevorkian defended himself at subsequent trials by claiming he took no action to assist in his patient's suicide. He had invented a machine that was designed to be operated by the patient using the machine. Therefore, Kevorkian argued he had no hand in causing the death of his patients. His patients had complete control of the suicide from start to finish. Kevorkian's role in the deaths was to simply help attach his patients to his machine. The rest was up to them. Some called Kevorkian a raging madman who lost his mind, while others called him an angel for helping to end the suffering of his patients.",C1
"An international agreement to improve safety in Bangladesh's clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. With some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe. The building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed. 
The problems come as hundreds of Bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for fire- safety and structural problems under the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, which is backed by over 170 international brands, including Primark and Marks & Spencer, and international trade unions, including IndustriALL. 
The owner of one Dhaka-based factory, Softex Cotton, has threatened legal action against the Accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems, prompting a demand for a reported $100m in compensation. 
Another factory owner, who declined to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: ""There is no such thing as temporary closure,"" he said. The factory owner said that the Accord agreement had ""pussyfooted"" around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster. He said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved. 
Jenny Holdcroft, policy director for IndustriALL, which has been closely involved in the Accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years. 
While 12 factories have been identified so far by the Accord as needing significant work, Holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors. The Accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. She said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution. 
""This was always going to be a topic of negotiation. Brands don't want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. There was obviously going to be disruption. If there was no disruption, there would be no change,"" she said. A spokesman for the Accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories. 
However, pressure on the Accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by US retailers including Walmart and Gap, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement. It has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended. 
""The Alliance is sharing the workers' salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. We had a big meeting with the Accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?"" said Shaidullah Azim, a director of the Bangladeshi Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.

"Chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to BP to significantly scale back, according to a CNN analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command.
When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent.
Public statements at the time made by the EPA administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to cut down overall dispersant use.
 We expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used, Jackson said in May.
Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit. Since then, CNN's analysis shows, the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day, a 9 percent decline.
Gulf Coast environmentalists say it's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with BP.
 I think the EPA has been struggling to respond to this crisis, said Aaron Viles with the Gulf Restoration Network. It's all really a giant science experiment and we 're terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant and we really do n't know what we 're doing to the ecosystem. 
But the EPA argues it deserves credit for getting alarming dispersant use under control. The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by 75 percent from the maximum daily amount used. 
And that's the catch. The highest recorded amount of dispersant used occurred on May 23, when 70,000 gallons were injected into the Gulf of Mexico. EPA officials say they feared that number would have become the norm and that's why, they say, the directive was issued.
 This escalation was quickly reversed, ensuring BP only uses the lowest volume of dispersant needed, said Adora Andy, a spokeswoman for the EPA.
But even by the EPA's own standards, BP still routinely exceeds the daily threshold. The EPA and Coast Guard say they 're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
But according to CNN's analysis, BP has gone over that amount 50 percent of the time since the May 26 directive was issued. To do so, BP must request permission from the U.S. Coast Guard.
Coast Guard officials say dispersant use is evaluated daily and that it's using the safest and most effective methods available to protect the sea environment.
 The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Erik Halvorson, a spokesman with the Unified Area Command.
The EPA continues testing the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500, which has been used by BP since the beginning of the oil disaster. So far more than 1.6 million gallons of the chemical have been injected into the Gulf of Mexico.
But the struggle over daily dispersant use has caught the eye of Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, one of the loudest critics of BP's response in cleaning up the oil spill.
 I think it is obvious we can never again allow for a repetition of what is happening right now, where the science experiment is being conducted without having any idea what the impact on marine life long term will be, said Markey.

"There are seven days of the week, or uniquely named 24-hour periods designed to provide scheduling context and make time more easily measureable. Each of these days is identifiable by specific plans, moods, and tones.
Monday is viewed by many to be the ""worst"" day of the week, as it marks the return to work following the weekend, when most full-time employees are given two days off. Most students attend school in the morning and return home in the afternoon (usually from about eight until three or seven until two), and most workers go to work in the morning and return home in the evening (usually from nine to five or eight to four).
Tuesday is the second day of the week, and is in many ways similar to Monday. Not a whole lot changes, schedule-wise, between Tuesday and Monday; most individuals go to school or work and return home to watch television, play video games, make plans with friends, spend time with family, read, or engage in a similar leisure-related activity.
Wednesday is the third day of the week, and serves as the ""middle"" of the work week; some individuals refer to Wednesday as ""hump day,"" as once its workday is complete, employees will have passed the work-week ""hump,"" and will be on the downturn, as only two days on the job will remain in the week.
Thursday is the fourth day of the week, and is viewed favorably by many, as it's rather close to the end of the work week.
Friday is the fifth day of the week, and marks the end of the workweek and school-week for the vast majority of employees and students. By Friday afternoon/evening, most students/workers cannot wait to leave and go home, as they won't have to report back to school/work until Monday.
Saturday is perhaps the most highly regarded day of the week. Because Sunday follows it (and there is presumably no work or school to attend, for most individuals), everyone is free to stay out (or awake) until late at night, having fun with plans or other leisure-related activities. To be sure, Saturday is generally thought of as a day to partake in hobbies that couldn't otherwise be enjoyed during the regular week.
Sunday is the final day of the week, and is used by most as a day of rest. Fewer late-night plans are made on Sundays, compared to Saturdays, as most individuals have to wake up for work or school on Monday morning.

"Unusually for someone who likes to chat, Kenton Cool can barely speak. Exerting himself at high altitude has left his voice a throaty growl. He is now in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, having flown down from Everest base camp that morning. Cool is reflecting on a startling sequence of climbs completed over the course of the previous weekend. Early on Saturday morning, he reached the summit of Nuptse, the first and lowest of the three main summits in the Everest ""horseshoe"" that surrounds the glaciated valley called the Western Cwm. 
That same day, he climbed up to the summit of Everest itself, reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday. He and his climbing partner then continued on to the summit of Lhotse, the third of this spectacular three-peaks challenge, on Monday morning. 
""It was a snatched opportunity,"" he says. ""For the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all three mountains. That doesn't take away the physical achievement of what I did. I've set the bar at a certain level. But whoever comes along next will move the bar further and do it without ropes or bottled oxygen."" 
Sixty years after Everest was first climbed, much of the coverage is looking back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental degradation. I've asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing 60 years from now. 
""I hate to think,"" he says, but mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the mountain in April following what Cool terms ""an altercation"" with a crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2. Steck, he says, was planning to climb Everest's west ridge, first done in 1963, descend to the South Col and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route, all without fixed ropes. ""Ueli had been training like a machine,"" Cool says. ""He's a climber in a class all his own. He's technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to an astronomic level. It would have been amazing to see what he could have done."" 
What tourism will look like is another matter. One clue is in the stunning helicopter rescue performed by Simone Moro, Steck's climbing partner, whose intemperate language provoked the confrontation at Camp 2. Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday at the controls of a high- powered helicopter to rescue a stricken climber at an altitude of 7,800 metres. 
It was the highest rescue yet performed on Everest and highlights the exponential rise in helicopter flights in recent years. By 2073, the infrastructure on the mountain could include a helipad on the South Col, bringing tourists breathing bottled oxygen. In the meantime, they are transforming the potential for rescuing both climbers and the far more numerous trekkers heading as far as base camp. 
Whether the Everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector remains to be seen, according to mountain geographer and environmentalist, Alton Byers. The combination of climate change and tourism, he says, is creating new stresses on the Sherpa homeland. The retreat, and in some cases disappearance, of glaciers in the Everest region are having a major impact already. ""Everywhere you go, people are talking about how there's less water. There's less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built."" 
In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar, he says, a new five-mile pipeline is being laid to bring water to service the growing tourist demand for showers and flush toilets. The local stream has become contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that, in high season, is bursting at the seams. ""Every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage. Khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world,"" he says. Human waste at base camp is now managed well and removed in plastic barrels. But, according to Byers, these barrels are emptied into a huge pit a few hours down the valley that could leak into the region's watercourses. 
""These problems can be solved, but we need to get serious about it,"" he says. ""One climber can spend $85,000 climbing Everest. And that's fine. But at some point we're going to have to address these other priorities. For half a million dollars a year, you could solve most of them."" 
Climate change is another matter. Byers works with local conservation committees to identify and plan for the impacts of climate change, most usually finding new water sources or introducing rainwater harvesting. The rapid build-up of glacial lakes that threaten to burst and flood the Sherpa homeland is a constant threat. ""There's going to come a time when people are going to have to get out of their way."" 
Changing weather patterns are also having an impact on tourism. Increased cloud cover in periods of normally clear weather is closing Lukla Airport, the gateway to the Everest region, more often. A new road for 4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money, but Byers is concerned that the rapid spread of the road network in Nepal is being done on the cheap, with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides. 
""Everest is the icon everyone knows,"" he says. ""It's the canary in the coalmine that everyone understands. It's the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to address some of these problems, like the impacts of climate change and tourism.""

"From glow-in-the-dark trees to underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins, we look at some of the more leftfield solutions to help make our cities more livable. 
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them. Pollution, traffic and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily trials that city-dwellers have to deal with. 
Step forward the inventors. We consider ten of the wackier solutions to making our cities more livable. 
1 Pop-up parks
Today's cities sometimes look like they're built more for cars than people. The pop-up park is a simple idea. Take an empty car park, a pocketful of change and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park. The PARK(ing) project kicked off as an arts experiment in San Francisco and has since spread across the world. Temporary urban farms and ecology demos are just some of the ideas to have emerged out of the movement, which celebrates a day of action every September.
2 Subterranean storage
Not all urban dwellers are hooked to the car. Bikes are ever more in vogue. The question is: where to keep it safe? Tokyo-based engineering firm Giken has come up with a concept for a solution: an ""ecocycle, anti-seismic underground bicycle park"". At just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep enough into the ground to house 204 bikes. Owners can retrieve their bike at the touch of a button, with the automated system delivering it back above ground in around 13 seconds.
3 Glow-in-the-dark trees
When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas baubles and fallen pine needles usually come to mind. Not Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has comes up with a ""bioluminescent"" plant. The experimental technology splices DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a jellyfish-type glow. Trials are underway to create an industrial-scale version of the biomimicry-inspired technology that Roosegaarde hopes could one day replace conventional street lighting.
4 Footfall harvesting
Every day, hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. Few probably notice the springiness beneath their feet. Fewer still connect that five-millimetre flex in the rubber surface to the powering of the streetlights above. The paved flooring is decked with smart tiles that capture the kinetic energy from pedestrians' footsteps and convert it into electricity. Pavegen, the UK firm behind the innovation, has installed a similar system at London's Heathrow Airport, among other international locations.
5 Supertrees
It had to happen eventually: man-made trees. Singapore's Gardens by the Bay has a small copse of them. Up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed 'supertrees' not only have flowers and ferns growing up them but their metallic canopies act to absorb and disperse heat too. They're equipped to harvest rainwater, too, as well as provide air ventilation for two ""climate-controlled biomes"" (large conservatories, in other words) below. Eleven of the 18 trees also boast solar panels along their 'branches'.
6 Water-producing billboard
We live in a consumer world. And, so we don't forget it, advertisers wallpaper our cities and highways with banks of billboards. Researchers at Lima's University of Engineering and Technology have come up with a billboard with a difference. Using a system of condensers and filters, it traps the humidity in the air and extracts the water vapour to produce around 96 litres of drinking water a day. The public can help themselves to it for free.
7 Neo-walled gardens
Gardens stopped being just the preserve of people's front lawns long ago. For a while, roof gardens were all the rage. Now, it's all about walls. Drawing on advances in hydroponics (growing plants without soil), the facades of a growing number of libraries and offices, shops and hotels are bursting into flower. One of the companies at the forefront of the ""living wall"" boom is UK-based firm Biotecture. The company's ""vertical gardens"" can be seen gracing the Taj Hotel in central London and the exit wall of Edgware Road Tube Station, among other locations. Aesthetics aside, green walls are credited with reducing air pollution and improving air quality.
8 Algae-powered building
To prove the dynamism of the ""living wall"" concept, look no further than Hamburg's International Building Exhibition. Instead of sweet-smelling flowers, the south-facing facades of the zero-carbon apartment complex are laced with green-tinged algae. The walls' external fabric includes a ""bio-skin"" of hollow grass panels on which the algae photosynthesizes and grows. Periodically, the algae is harvested from the walls and fermented in a biogas plant to produce electricity.
9 Smart rubbish bins
Forget gas-guzzling dumper trucks and smelly skips. City authorities around the world are now turning to solar-powered ""trash compactors"" to keep litter off the streets. The 150-gallon-capacity rubbish bins are equipped with a motor that pushes down the rubbish when it nears the top. The motor is powered by solar panels embedded in the lid. The newest BigBelly bins include a wireless monitoring system that notifies rubbish collectors when the bins are full.
10 Spray paint
Finally, desperate times may sometimes call for desperate measures. That's clearly what was going through the minds of authorities in Chengdu, one of China's fastest growing cities. To brighten up the place, the municipal landscaping department has taken to spraying the yellowing grass green. Use of the non-toxic green spray has now spread to Tianjin and a host of other cities in China's north-west.

"I do n't think the euro should exist, said Saxo Bank co-CEO Lars Seier Christensen to CNN's Richard Quest, in terms that could hardly be less fractious to supporters of the 17-nation single currency bloc.
 It's quite clear that what lacks here is fiscal union but it's also very clear that the populations of Europe are not supportive of that goal. 
The eurozone will also pull itself apart as competitiveness will continue to develop in different directions, said the head of the online Danish investment bank. He added that the people of the eurozone -- in particular, Germany as the monetary zone's prime pillar -- will not make sacrifices for the weaker part of the eurozone -- Greece and other southern European countries.
Christensen's controversial comments stand in stark contrast to what eurozone supporters have said -- advocating for austerity to keep the union together.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, fears that a Greek exit from the eurozone could lead to a domino effect in which other massively-indebted countries -- Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy -- may pull out from the common currency, leading to the breakup of the eurozone.
In December 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel won more support for bailout funds for Greece. In July, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank promised to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro which set off rallies for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds.
Still, Saxo Bank's Christensen believes the euro will disappear at some point in the future -- and despite hitting 13-month highs -- because he believes overall support does not exist.
 I 'm not saying it's a bad thing that support is not there, said Christensen, because the ability to adjust your currency is an important equilibrium between different economies and different developments. When that's gone you 're left with a completely different set of problems. 
The bank CEO declined to give a timeline but said it depends how long the Germans hold out... how long the German population is willing to buy into supporting fiscal union.
 I can tell you the problem is going to get greater rather than smaller... I fear that the markets will take the thing apart eventually.

"David Cameron has declared a ""clear result"" in the Scottish independence referendum after Scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year-old union with England and Wales. The prime minister promised a devolution revolution across Great Britain, including votes on English issues by English MPs at Westminster, as he welcomed Scotland's decision to remain inside the UK. ""There can be no disputes, no reruns - we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people,"" Cameron said in a statement 
Earlier, Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, remained defiant at a downbeat Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh, saying he accepted Scotland had not, ""at this stage"", decided to vote for independence. He paid tribute to what he called a ""triumph for democratic politics"" and said he would work with Westminster in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK - warning the leaders of the three main parties to make good on their promises of enhanced devolution for Scotland. ""We have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,"" he said. 
The yes campaign scored four big successes, winning 53% of the vote in Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire. However, the no camp was victorious in 28 authorities. It won overwhelmingly in areas where it was expected to do well, including Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire and Borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the Western Isles. In the final count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) to 1,617,989 for yes (44.7%). 
In his speech, Cameron made clear that the constitutional reforms, including in Scotland, would not be delivered until after the general election, and that Scottish measures would proceed in tandem with changes in England. ""We have heard the voice of Scotland and, now, the millions of voices of England must be heard,"" he said. 
Cameron added: ""The people of Scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. They have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, I am delighted. As I said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end. And I know that sentiment was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future. So, now, it is time for our United Kingdom to come together and to move forward. A vital part of that will be a balanced settlement, fair to people in Scotland and, importantly, to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well."" 
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change. ""We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for. We will deliver on stronger powers for a stronger Scottish parliament, a strong Scotland."" But he said that would go beyond Scotland. ""We will also meet the desire for change across England, across Wales, across the whole of the United Kingdom."" 
Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum ""marks not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but also wider constitutional reform across the union"". Echoing the SNP's argument, he said a vote against independence was ""clearly not a vote against change"". ""We must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to Scotland,"" he added. 
Yet that result raises the risk of further turmoil, with MPs from Cameron's Conservative Party threatening to revolt against the prime minister's late and potentially vital promise to quickly increase the Scottish parliament's powers while protecting its spending. 
The UK Independence Party leader, Nigel Farage, said Cameron's offer of more devolution for England did not go far enough. ""The English are 86% by population of this union. They've been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on English-only issues. I think what most English people want is a fair settlement,"" he said. 
Cameron and the Queen will both move to calm tensions when they deliver statements on the result. The prime minister will try, in the words of one cabinet minister, to ""cement in"" the no vote by outlining how he will deliver the deepening of Scotland's devolution settlement, including handing greater powers over tax and welfare to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. 
The Queen, who has monitored the referendum with interest, will make a written statement. It is understood that her remarks will focus on reconciliation. The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will live up to their commitments made during the referendum campaign to deliver what the former prime minister Gordon Brown called ""home rule"" within the UK. 
Ministers believe it is important to move quickly to avoid a repeat of the 1980 referendum in Quebec. The triumphalist behaviour of Ontario fuelled the separatist cause that nearly succeeded in a second referendum in 1995. 
For the no campaign, there was relief: a spate of authoritative polls in the final days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knife-edge, bringing Yes Scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support.

"A man believed to have been exposed to the deadly poison ricin in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Nevada, is out of his coma and is being questioned by authorities, FBI Special Agent David Staretz said Friday.
Ricin, guns and an anarchist-type textbook were found in a room in this Las Vegas hotel, police say.
Staretz would not comment further on Roger Bergendorff, 57, who authorities said was taken to a hospital February 14 after complaining of breathing difficulties.
He is listed in critical condition, said Naomi Jones, spokeswoman for Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas.
Bergendorff, an artist who neighbors said had lived in his cousin's basement before moving to Las Vegas, was exposed to the poison in a Las Vegas extended-stay hotel, a law enforcement official said.
The Riverton, Utah, home where Bergendorff previously lived belongs to Thomas Tholen, who along with his wife and daughter tested negative for ricin, according to authorities. That home and three storage areas in nearby West Jordan, Utah, were searched for ricin earlier this month and declared safe by authorities.
A relative who went to Bergendorff's hotel room after he was sent to the hospital found the substance and alerted police February 27.
Ricin is a poison that can be made from waste left over after processing castor beans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can come in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid, the agency said. E-mail to a friend

"There is nothing terribly surprising in Apple's refreshed line of tablets, but that's OK.
We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference. As promised by Apple executives, the new devices were lighter, thinner and seemingly faster -- just like many incremental product upgrades from the past.
iPad Air
There were no major new features, such as the fingerprint scanner or camera upgrade that came with the iPhone 5S.
The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $499 fifth-generation iPad, which is now the iPad Air. The iPad line has been a bit wishy-washy with names.
It began by counting each version, but then dropped the number and asked only to be know as iPad, like Cher. The iPad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores, where its slightly lower price tag -LRB- now $399 -RRB- might appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet.
Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor. It's 20 % thinner than the third generation iPad, measuring in at a slight.29 - inch. An ad shown at the press conference showed an iPad Air lying flat on a tablet, hiding discretely behind a No. 2 pencil. It has also dropped a bit of weight and the Wi-Fi version is now exactly 1 pound -LRB- the cellular version is 1.05 pounds -RRB-.
Unfortunately, I did n't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I 'd picked up an iPad Mini first. Nothing makes a regular iPad feel hefty like holding an iPad Mini. You ca n't unfeel a Mini; it's just so delightfully wee.
The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced in the iPhone 5S. The A7 should benefit graphics heavy programs such as iMovie and iPhoto, and Phil Schiller claimed it would double the performance of the previous chip.
It is difficult to judge speed increases during a few minutes in a crowded room without proper tests and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison.
Fresh Apple products always feel zippier than previous generations. Part of that is the steadily improving processors inside, but its also the benefit of working on a new device that has n't been gradually slowed down by pages of apps, hundreds of cat videos and the latest operating system upgrade.
iPad Mini with Retina Display
The iPad Mini got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago.
Physically, the device is a dead ringer for the original. Fire it up, and you 'll see that it addresses one of the biggest complaints about the first version by upgrading the screen to a 2048-by-1536 display that packs in 326 pixels per inch, a big jump from the previous 163 pixels per inch. A number of Apple products already have the Retina Display: the iPhone 4S and up, the fourth generation iPod Touch, the 10-inch iPad and some MacBook Pros. -LRB- Apple says Retina Display is so good that the human eye ca n't spot out individual pixels on the device -RRB-.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside. Previously the Mini was a generation behind its larger iPad sibling in processor speed. But this upgrade and the new display put the devices on the same level, so picking a smaller screen no longer means opting for the inferior product.
The smaller tablet size is a competitive market, and the iPad Mini with Retina Display is finally Apple's premium offering for the 7.9-inch size. The $399 tablet is now in a better position to take on products such as Google's Nexus 7, Samsung's Galaxy tablets and Amazon's Kindle HDX. Though other products can usually be had for much less, any hands-on time with Apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid, high-quality construction.
The missing upgrade
Shaving off excess bulk and swapping out faster processors is de rigueur for any product update these days. Other companies might throw in price drops, but Apple is comfortable in its spot at the high-end of the consumer market. It wo n't start slashing devices for its flagship devices. Instead, the company keeps older models available, though even those are priced somewhat high.
Unfortunately, there is one key feature where all the tablet makers seem to have stalled: battery life.
Faster processors gobble up more battery power, so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements. Both new iPads have the same M7 motion co-processor that handles sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, saving battery power by not using the main processor.
Other than an hour here or there, mobile devices makers seem stuck at the half-day mark, a frustrating limitation for people who have adapted by carting around chargers and scrambling to re-up anytime they spot an empty outlet at a cafe, airport or friend's house.
For now, Apple is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well-designed, popular products, making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention, such as fingerprints on the iPhone 5S.
It may not be as much fun for tech fans who were used to splashy new products and well-kept secrets, but it's probably a solid business decision.
According to Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps, replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new new tablet sales worldwide. Manufacturers need to compete to keep the customers they already have who are considering upgrading from an old model.
All the tablet makers are competing with what are essentially the same minor tweaks.
The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.

"A thick crust of bird droppings is piled on the gilded balustrade of one of Britain's most expensive properties. Pigeon skeletons lie among shattered mirrors and water streams through broken cornicing. This is The Towers, a GBP30m palace in ""Billionaires' Row"" in north London, whose spectacular ruin has been kept secret until now. 
It is one of ten mansions in the middle of The Bishops Avenue - the heart of London's spiralling property market - that have stood almost entirely vacant since they were bought a quarter of a century ago, it is believed on behalf of members of the Saudi Arabian royal family. Their Grecian columns are cracking into pieces and mosaic-tiled swimming pools are filled with rubble. Nature has taken over to the extent that owls have moved in. 
It is a desolate scene repeated up and down the supposedly prestigious avenue that Lloyds Bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in Britain. While more and more people struggle to get on to London's property ladder as house prices rise at 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive stretch of The Bishops Avenue are sitting empty, many behind padlocked gates, with their windows shuttered with steel grilles and overgrown grounds patrolled by guard dogs. 
Across the street stands another derelict mansion, worth GBP18m, with smashed windows and walls coated in anti-climb paint. Metal grilles block the windows of another, which has been sold for GBP20m. 
But that doesn't stop the prices going up. Dryades, a mansion until recently owned by a Pakistani politician, sold for GBP12m in 2007 and is believed to be worth about GBP30m today. Heath Lodge, the scene of the 1984 murder, by silver bullet, of fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou, is worth GBP13m today, after having been sold in the late 1970s for GBP400,000. 
The dereliction can be agonizing for people struggling to keep a roof above their heads in one of the world's most expensive cities. One security guard working on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many tens of thousands of square feet of property - enough to house dozens of people - falling apart. 
Royals flushed with oil wealth from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia were among the first to come to this curving road near Hampstead Heath. Iranians fled here after the fall of the shah. Now, Chinese house hunters are following Russians and Kazakhs who have spent millions securing an address estate agents tell them is as world famous as the Champs Elysees and Rodeo Drive. Recently, two mansions have been on sale for GBP65m and GBP38m, promising endless Italian marble, leather-padded lifts and luxury panic rooms. 
However, in the grounds of the empty mansions, stone fountains crumble and lawns have become bogs. Inside one, water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet rotting under sections of collapsed ceiling. Moss grows through shattered bricks and mirrored tiles are scattered across a bathroom. The swimming pool is filled with a foot of brackish water and has flowers growing through its tiles. Wooden slats bulge away from the sauna. 
But it is the wreck of The Towers, a grand mansion set among acres of hornbeams, oaks and limes, that is most dramatic, with its huge, high-ceiling halls occupied by pigeons and its walls turned bright green by algae as water pours through three storeys and plinks into a vast, empty, basement swimming pool. Unopened wooden crates marked ""bullet- proof glass"" reveal the security fears of the previous owners. 
Today, very few people live on The Bishops Avenue full time. A security guard patrolling the pavement outside one mansion said that the owners were not there. Another, outside Royal Mansion, declined to say if anyone was home, while a member of staff at another mansion simply warned the Guardian about the guard dogs. Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, an Egyptian-born private healthcare mogul, whose personal wealth is GBP45m, said he was in the minority of permanent residents. 
""It's not a neighbourly place, where you can chat over the fence,"" he said. ""To be honest, I have never seen what my neighbours look like. Next door, a Saudi princess spent GBP35m on a new house and I've never seen her. There are about three houses that are lived in 24/7 and half of the properties are occupied three to six months a year. The other half, who knows if they come or not?"" 
The multimillion-pound wrecks are evidence of a property culture in which the world's richest people see British property as investments. One Hyde Park, a block of apartments in Knightsbridge, is another example where more than half the flats are registered with the council as empty or second homes. 
Nevertheless, the talk on the avenue is about building GBP5m apartments, instead of GBP50m mansions, in an effort to draw people back. 
Anil Varma, a local property developer, has decided to rebuild one of the most valuable sites on the avenue as a collection of 20 apartments with a concierge, maid service, 25-metre pool, spa and cinema. 
""If you build a big house and try and sell for GBP30m to GBP40m, it won't sell,"" he said. ""Locals won't buy and so you have to bring in overseas buyers."" 
But the prospect of the avenue's empty property being used to help solve the housing crisis remains distant. Andrew Harper, a local Conservative councillor, laughed when asked whether some of the derelict housing could become affordable homes. He said the land price would be prohibitive. 
""Very wealthy people own property there,"" he said. ""Sometimes they live in them and sometimes they don't.""

"Once again, there are rumblings that the third - and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers may merge to form a larger combined No. 3. But would this be enough to keep the U.S. wireless market competitive for consumers ?
Last week Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Telekom AG, the parent company of T-Mobile, is negotiating a possible sale of T-Mobile to Sprint Nextel Corp..
According to The Hill and The Washington Post, some industry analysts believe the U.S. government would approve this merger. Rumors of this merger have been around since 2009, when DT was eyeing a purchase of Sprint.
And last weekend, TMOnews reported on an ambiguous non-confirmation/non-denial memo sent to T-Mobile employees by CEO Philip Humm.
Given the nature of wireless networks and the current business landscape, T-Mobile probably needs to make some kind of major move if it hopes to survive in some form.
In the big picture, it takes a lot of capital to build out high-speed wireless broadband networks that can support an ever-growing number of data-hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets -- especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular, and if the Obama administration is serious about its national wireless initiative to make wireless broadband available to 98 % of the U.S. population.
Carriers with the largest customer base -- especially the most customers locked in to pricey two-year contracts -- are in the best financial position to build out their 4G networks.
Having those networks, in turn, makes the largest carriers even more likely to attract even more customers. And this is the economic dynamic that could turn the U.S. wireless market into a Verizon/AT & T duopoly, with only some discount carriers surviving on the fringes.
For U.S. mobile users, further wireless market consolidation is a good news/bad news situation. It offers the promise of ubiquitous high-speed wireless broadband networks available in markets outside major metro areas, which would lessen the geographic aspect of the mobile digital divide.
But just because wireless broadband is available in a region does n't mean everyone there can afford to use it. A less competitive wireless market could mean wireless broadband wo n't get much cheaper. And it could even get more costly, especially if tiered data plans become the norm -- which would make more sense for the carriers in a less competitive environment.
That would be bad news on the income/class front of the mobile digital divide.
Lately, T-Mobile has been taking a bit of a beating in the U.S. market. Bloomberg noted: T-Mobile... has lost customers at an accelerated rate as it trailed rivals in building out a third-generation mobile network and missed out on being able to sell Apple's iPhone. About 56,000 customers abandoned T-Mobile USA last year, while Sprint, AT&T and Verizon Wireless all boosted their counts. 
Consequently, DT may not be pleased with what Sprint may be willing to offer for T-Mobile -- so who knows if this merger will happen.
Furthermore, a T-Mobile/Sprint merger might be difficult for technical reasons.
Wireless Week noted: T-Mobile currently markets its HSPA + network as 4G but lacks the bandwidth to deploy LTE or WiMAX. Sprint and T-Mobile use different network technology and operate on different spectrum bands, which would complicate a possible merger of the companieswireless services. 
If T-Mobile hopes to survive intact, it 'll need access to much more bandwidth in more U.S. locations. So if the Sprint merger does n't happen, T-Mobile does have options -- mainly leasing additional spectrum or access to other providersnetworks, such as LightSquared, a wholesale-only wireless LTE network.

"It is not just the world's biggest burger chain; it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism. But, these days, the golden arches of McDonald's are looking a little tarnished. After a decade of expansion, customers around the world don't seem to be 'lovin' it' any more. McDonald's has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious. 
Problems are piling up almost everywhere. In China, sales plunged by 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald's and KFC. In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of unrest in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia. Around 200 of McDonald's 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated food-safety checks. Ten have been closed. 
But it is in the US, where McDonald's has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest. Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries. 
McDonald's has seen 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter. Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald's once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown. 
To add to the company's problems, McDonald's hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. Fast-growing US-only chain Chick-fil-A was considered to be best for chicken. McDonald's is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and ""locally sourced, seasonal produce"" - although 'local' for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away. 
The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonald's was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October. ""Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?"" was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website - referring to the controversial beef filler (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it ""fit"" for human consumption. The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was dropped by McDonald's in 2012. 
But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers' minds. ""Does McDonald's beef contain worms?"" asked another person (""No. Gross. End of story,"" replied the company). Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats. McDonald's Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of its ingredients. 
Yet, just as McDonald's has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower. 
The ""expensive"" tag was unjustified, said Mary Chapman at Technomic. ""Prices have indeed gone up but they haven't gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US."" Prices at McDonald's have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the ""quick service"" sector average (up 19.4%), while the cost of ""fast casual"" eating, a category that includes the much-hyped Chipotle, is up 16.9%, according to Technomic's menu monitor. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period. 
But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues. McDonald's has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items - its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make. ""I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,"" said Chapman. 
In the UK, McDonald's has turned around its business, making Britain a rare bright spot for the company. A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-fi had given McDonald's a broad appeal in the UK, said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach whose figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald's restaurant at least once in the last six months. 
Executives are promising to tackle misconceptions about its food in its home market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers but, to cut down queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of simpler menus and greater choice over fillings. 
""They want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky,"" said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets. Only four out of McDonald's 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested ""build your own burger"", he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up. ""Right now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail."" 
Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonald's market share will continue to shrink but he, too, warned against writing off the company. ""You can never really count McDonald's out. We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years but decades to come.""

"JMW Turner, one of Britain's greatest painters, is to be the face of the new GBP20 note, following a nationwide vote. 
It will be the first time an artist has appeared on a British banknote, after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour. 
Turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public. 
The list included Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander McQueen, Derek Jarman, Laura Ashley, William Morris and Vanessa Bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five. 
The final five - Barbara Hepworth, Charlie Chaplin, Josiah Wedgwood, William Hogarth and Turner - were selected on the basis of their ""unquestioned"" contribution to both the visual arts and British society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence. 
Fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate, which stands on the former site of Mrs Booth's lodging house, where Turner would always stay when he visited. The announcement was made jointly by Carney and the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the town. 
Carney said it had been ""so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,"" adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, ""if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone's pocket"". 
""Money is memory for a country and its people,"" said the Bank of England governor. ""Banknotes of the Bank of England are a celebration of the UK's heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. In short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well. 
""Turner is arguably the single most influential British artist of all time. His work was transformative and endures today. And his work will now feature on another 2bn works of art - our new GBP20 notes."" 
""The fact that we will have Turner on the GBP20 note shows now that the British people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,"" said Emin. 
The note will feature Turner's 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in Tate Britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, The Fighting Temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. 
Emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist - ""light is therefore colour"" - as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation. 
The new GBP20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist Adam Smith, will enter circulation by 2020. This is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a British banknote. ",C1

2008 championship runner-up Massa was stunned and lost control as his Ferrari flew into a tire wall at high speed.
He was airlifted from the circuit to the AEK Hospital in Budapest and later underwent an emergency operation for the damage to his skull.
Massa is in intensive care on a respirator and remains under observation in an induced coma.
 The condition of the driver is serious, but stable, said a hospital spokesman.
After the frightening incident, Fernando Alonso claimed a surprising pole position in a chaotic end to Saturday's proceedings.
The Massa accident happened at the end of the second qualifying session and the action was suspended while officials checked for debris.
When the third and final qualifying session got underway it was Renault's Alonso clocked the fastest time of one minute 21.559 seconds.
Sebastian Vettel, second in the title race to Jenson Button, will start alongside Alonso on the front row, with his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber qualifying third.
Button was only eighth fastest with Brawn GP teammate Barrichello 13th best, their worst qualifying performance of the season.
Button delayed his final qualifying run while his car was checked out after the earlier incident.
Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth best for the improving McLaren team with Nico Rosberg in fifth for Williams.
With the electronic timing system lost to the pit lane and the television coverage, former two-time world champion Alonso was at first unaware he had taken his first pole of the season.
 We have made a good step forward and the car did improve in the last two races. We are more competitive, but I do n't think we are as quick as these two guys -LRB- referring to Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber -RRB-, he said.
 We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our target is to get some good points, added the Spaniard.

"Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan Solomon tearfully pleaded Thursday for leniency for her brother, who was sentenced to prison on a lesser charge in his fatal altercation with their father.
A Middlesex County Superior Court judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to 2.5 years after a jury convicted him Wednesday of assault and battery.
A jury acquitted Kerrigan on an involuntary manslaughter charge. The prosecution argued that the elder Kerrigan died from a heart attack caused during a physical struggle.
Solomon asked Judge Jane Haggerty for no prison time for her brother, saying the family had already suffered enough trauma and hardship.
 None of us have had really the chance to grieve for our father, she said in court.
Mark Kerrigan was taken into custody immediately, said Cara O'Brien, spokeswoman for the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office.
The judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to serve two years in prison, followed by two years of probation, during which he will have to satisfy several conditions, including mental health and alcohol abuse treatment, according to O'Brien.
If Kerrigan completes all the conditions, the remaining six months of his prison sentence will be suspended, the judge ruled.
Mark Kerrigan showed little emotion as the verdict was read Wednesday in Woburn, Massachusetts.
 My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death, Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse. My dad would never have wanted any of this. 
Prosecutors say Daniel Kerrigan, 70, died after having an argument and physical confrontation with his intoxicated son.
A medical examiner had found that Daniel Kerrigan's 2010 death came from cardiac dysrhythmia triggered by the brawl, which resulted in a larynx injury. Cardiac dysrhythmia is abnormal electrical activity in the heart.
Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.

"Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year.
The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit's WJR radio station, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day.
 I had a career before politics and always planned to have one after, Rogers said in a statement. The genius of our institutions is they are not dependent on the individual temporary occupants privileged to serve. That is why I have decided not to seek re - election to Congress in 2014. 
Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature.
This week, he and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee -- came up with a plan for ending the NSA's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records.
Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA
Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor.
He also has acknowledged public worries about government storage of surveillance data.
 That's really what we 're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs, Rogers said recently.
Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said.
Rogers is also a favorite of Sunday public affairs programming on which he frequently criticizes Obama.
He joins a cadre of House members not seeking reelection in November, but his seat in the 8th Congressional District is still considered relatively safe for Republicans.
But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from likely Republican to lean Republican for the November election following Rogersannouncement.
Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner.
 Senior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee John Boehner's broken Congress rather than defend their indefensible record of siding with special interests over middle class families that has earned them record low approval ratings, Rep. Steve Israel of New York who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Rogers became a key figure in developing U.S. national security policy, informed by his experience as an Army officer and FBI special agent.
U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8
 Mike has spent his entire life ensuring our country has been kept safe from threats both foreign and domestic, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement. He never once let partisan politics stand in the way of doing what's right for our nation and its safety. I ca n't think of anyone who enjoys more respect from both Republicans and Democrats alike. 
Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, his Intelligence Committee biography said.
 Mike Rogers is as solid as they come -- one of those patriots willing to go to the wall to keep the American people safe, no matter the strain or sacrifice, Boehner said in a statement.
CNN's Jim Acosta, Tom Cohen, Lisa Desjardins and John Helton contributed to this report.

"There are eyes on you, behind the bright lights and mirrored panels. Pick up a boot and a camera will make sure you don't slip it into your bag. Enter a department store and you will be watched. But new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes - less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, sex, size, head, shoulders, knees and toes. 
A few months ago, IT firm Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) produced a report that claimed around 30% of retailers use facial recognition technology to track customers in-store. Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database, using devices such as Intel RealSense cameras, which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing. 
Joe Jensen, of Intel's Retail Solutions Division, says that the aim of bringing RealSense technology into shops is not to create databases of specific people's lives but rather to build generalized models of people's lifestyles and shopping habits. ""It's not so much that you need to know a particular customer. It's that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do."" 
If you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns, you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop. If, say, there's a size-10 woman wearing a gold necklace walking quickly towards the sock aisle, you can use that data to predict she wants to, well, buy socks. That could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed specifically at that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks. 
If it sounds familiar, it's because the online world has been using techniques like these for years. 
If you search for something on Amazon, you'll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites. Express a vague interest in canoeing and you'll get ads for canoes wherever you go. Yet bringing these systems into the physical world isn't a simple case of copy and paste. It turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies. 
Hoxton Analytics, a London-based team of data scientists, has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing. By analysing the style and size of people's footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customer's gender with between 75 and 80% accuracy. 
Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition. ""My idea was, why don't we simply consider the clothes someone's wearing to understand demographics?"" he said. ""If I just showed you a shot of someone's body you could probably tell me what gender they are. However, it turns out pointing a camera at someone's chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition. The idea was - what about people's shoes?"" 
The word ""creepy"" comes up a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. For retailers and data scientists, the aim is to find a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive. 
For Hoxton Analytics and the retailers using the technology, the answer is to look downwards. This tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we, as physical beings, react to being watched. It suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet. Set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded. But is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually any less invasive? 
For McCormack, the argument hinges on the fact that personally identifiable information isn't being collected. ""Right now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just don't know about it. The angle Hoxton Analytics is taking on that whole thing is, well, if you know someone's a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more efficient. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, you'll be advertising PlayStations not hairdryers."" 
Keep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware. Put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix, however, and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you. The argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area. It still feels creepy. 
From the perspective of retailers, it's understandable that physical shops want some of the information online outlets collect. We allow this to happen online so why not offline? The thresholds of a shopping centre are different from those between websites and, when you can wander freely from one place to another without a pop-up asking you to accept cookies, the rules of consent change. 
Then again, for a generation growing up with online first, physical shop second, the modes of online play may not be quite so invasive. In the CSC report, a survey indicated that while 72% of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops, only 51% of 16-24 year olds said the same. 
Does this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services? Is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying, instinctive certainty or does it ebb and flow with degrees of social acceptance? Whatever the case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what you're wearing.

"With its palaces, sculpted parks, concert halls and museums, Vienna is a city steeped in culture.
Once home to composers including Beethoven, Mozart, and Johann Strauss, and to artists Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, as well as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, Vienna has been at the forefront of major cultural movements for centuries.
But that does n't mean it's stuck in the past; Vienna has a youthful side, too, and is visited yearly by backpackers as much as mainline culture aficionados -- something Richard Linklater celebrated in his 1995 film Before Sunrise, which charted two strangers falling in love in the course of one day, with Vienna as the romantic backdrop.
Whether you visit in the winter for Christmas markets glittering under snowflakes, or in the spring when the flowers in the city's many parks are in bloom, the city is sure to charm.
CNN World's Treasures selects some of the best spots to experience Old World Vienna, from galleries and parks to historic landmarks.
SEE
2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, one of the founding members of the Vienna Secession, an avant-garde artistic group at the turn of the century.
Indeed, one of the city's architectural masterpieces, the art nouveau Secession building, was commissioned by the group at as a haven for the latest in contemporary art.
The Museum features Klimt's Beethoven mural, but to see his famed golden-hued painting The Kiss, head to the Belvedere Museum, housed in a magnificent palace built in the 1700s. It boasts a comprehensive collection of Klimt paintings, alongside works by Kokoschka, Schiele, Vincent van Gogh and Auguste Rodin among others.
Vienna's turn-of-the-century painters owed much to the new theories about the mind coming from Sigmund Freud, and no trip to Vienna would be complete without visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum, where the founder of psychoanalysis lived until he was forced to flee in 1938. Take in a lecture or simply wander around the original waiting room and imagine you are about to be examined by the great man himself.
For those looking to feast their eyes on earlier examples of the city's opulent past, look no further than the Schatzkammer, the imperial treasury and home to the Hapsburg Crown Jewels, which is located in the vast Hofburg Palace, seat of the ruling Hapsburg dynasty.
HEAR
For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must-visit, as it was in the eighteenth century, when it attracted the young Mozart.
You can visit the apartment Mozart lived in when he composed The Marriage of Figaro among other great works, which has been turned into a museum and boasts temporary exhibitions, in addition to the permanent collection of objects in the house itself. You can even hear his music wafting through the rooms as you wander around.
For concerts, head to the Musikverein for performances by the Wiener Philharmoniker and smaller chamber concerts. Or for operas, book a seat at the grand Staatsoper, or the Theater-an-der-Wien, where works by Beethoven and Strauss originally premiered.
STROLL
Vienna has a wealth of open spaces and parks, from the sculpted alpine gardens at the Belvedere Castle to the more laid-back, youthful feel of Danube Island. Rathauspark boasts an ice-skating rink in winter and an open-air cinema in summer. Alternatively, take a walk around the Baroque gardens at the Schonbrunn Palace. A well-worn tourist activity is to ride the Ferris wheel at the Prater Amusement Park, which features in the Graham Greene-penned noir film The Third Man. 
STAY
Places to stay in Vienna are plentiful and cater to all budgets. The Hotel Altstadt is located in the arty Spittelberg district, just behind the MuseumsQuartier and features an impressive contemporary art and design collection; Das Tyrol, a cozy former monastery with a small spa, features art works by young Viennese artists; the Konig von Ungarn has the benefit of being in the same complex of 300-year-old buildings as Mozart's one-time living quarters; and the Hilton Vienna Danube has views over the river.
EAT
Viennese cuisine is not for those watching their waistlines; mouth-watering pastries and cakes, breaded meats and beer and wine a-plenty make the city a feast for the taste-buds. Steirereck serves an impressive, if also not exactly slimming array of delicious Viennese dishes, while Demel serves coffee and cakes for an afternoon treat in-between sightseeing.

"An American imprisoned for nearly a month in the United Arab Emirates for taking photos has been released from custody and returning home to Georgia, a family spokeswoman said.
Robert Alan Black -- who 'd been in the UAE to speak at an international creativity conference -- had been held in Abu Dhabi's Al Wathba prison since October 21 after being charged with taking pictures of restricted areas, said Rosemary Rein, the spokeswoman for Friends of Alan Black.
A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. Doing so is prohibited in some parts of the UAE, particularly in and around government buildings, embassies, military facilities and other places that are considered sensitive.
He made a brief court appearance Monday, and was released the following day.
 The court found that the action was committed with no ill-intention, and ordered the minimum fine of 500 -LRB- UAE dirhams or about US $135 -RRB-, according to Rein's statement, which was posted to a Free Robert Alan Black Facebook page.
After his release, the 70-year-old headed to his home in Athens, Georgia.
 We 're relieved and happy with this news, Rein said. The international creativity community was concerned about our dear friend and colleague, and we 're glad the matter has been resolved. 
Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website. He has given presentations at more more than 150 creativity conferences on six continents since 1978, and has written more than 600 articles and a book, Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines. 
Rein has said Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia. But after noticing he had n't posted to social media, she touched base with mutual acquaintances and learned that he 'd never made it to Malaysia.

"Until the last, David Bowie, who has died of cancer, was still capable of springing surprises. His latest album, Blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 January 2016 and proved that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music hadn't deserted him. 
Throughout the 1970s, Bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. Having been a late-60s mime and cabaret entertainer, he evolved into a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then veered into what he called ""plastic soul"", before moving to Berlin to create innovative electronic music. His capacity for mixing brilliant changes of sound and image underpinned by a genuine intellectual curiosity is rivalled by few in pop history. 
Bowie was born David Robert Jones in south London. In 1953, the family moved to Kent, where David showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder. Later, he studied art, music and design. In 1961, David's mother bought him a plastic saxophone, introducing him to an instrument which would become a recurring ingredient in his music. 
At 15, David formed his first band, the Kon-rads. It was clear that David's talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo. David adopted the name Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees. 
Bowie's first album, released in June 1967, was titled simply David Bowie . In July 1969, Bowie released Space Oddity, the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough. Timed to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five UK hit. 
In March 1970, Bowie married art student, Angela Barnett. Artistically, Bowie was powering ahead. The Man Who Sold the World was released in the US in late 1970 and in the UK the following year, and with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing gifts. The album's themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, evidence that Bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond pop's usual boundaries. 
He followed it with 1972's Hunky Dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. It was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars later that year. 
This time, Bowie emerged as a fully fledged science-fiction character - an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting a doomed planet Earth - and the album effectively wrote the script for his own stardom. The hit single Starman brought instant success for the album, while Bowie's ravishing stage costumes and provocative performances triggered fan enthusiasm unseen since Beatlemania. 
Everything Bowie touched turned to gold. He had his first UK number 1 album with Aladdin Sane (1973), which generated the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drive-in Saturday . But Bowie was already planning fresh career moves. 
His increasing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore on the deliciously listenable Young Americans (1975), which gave him a US chart-topper with Fame (featuring John Lennon as a guest vocalist). 
Station to Station (1976) introduced a new persona, the Thin White Duke, which Bowie had carried over from his headlining performance as a melancholy space traveller in Nicolas Roeg's film The Man Who Fell to Earth. 
Bowie's relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. This was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and its spin- off chart-topping single, Ashes to Ashes, followed by Bowie's well-received stint as John Merrick in The Elephant Man on the Broadway stage. He achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with Queen, Under Pressure while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media. He appeared in the German movie Christiane F (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. He had another chart hit with Cat People (Putting Out Fire) from Paul Schrader's movie Cat People (1982). Bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in The Hunger and the second world war drama Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, both released in 1983. 
Musically, this was the year in which he put his energy into an all-out commercial onslaught with the album Let's Dance and follow-up concerts. Let's Dance moulded Bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles Let's Dance, China Girl and Modern Love all becoming huge international hits. 
This was the heyday of MTV and Bowie's knack for eye-catching videos fuelled this commercial splurge, while the six-month Serious Moonlight tour drew massive crowds. It was to be the most commercially successful period of his career. His profile gained another boost from his appearance at the 1985 Live Aid famine relief concert at Wembley Stadium, where he was one of the standout performers. In addition, he teamed up with Mick Jagger to record the fundraising single Dancing in the Street, which sped to number 1. A few days after his appearance at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992, Bowie married the Somalian model Iman and the couple bought a home in New York. This new start in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration. 
For the album Black Tie White Noise (1993), he sprinkled elements of soul, electronica and hip hop into the mix. It topped the UK album chart and yielded a top 10 single, Jump They Say . New media and technology influenced his recordings, too. His 1999 album Hours ... was based around music he had written for a computer game called Omikron, in which Bowie and Iman appeared as characters. The birth of Bowie and Iman's daughter, Alexandria, followed in August 2000. 
As an adopted New Yorker, Bowie was the opening act at the Concert for New York City in October 2001, where he joined Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Billy Joel, the Who and Elton John in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks. Bowie was back in the studio the following year for Reality . However, in the midst of his Reality tour in 2004, Bowie was stricken with chest pains while performing in Germany and underwent emergency surgery in Hamburg to clear a blocked artery. 
He took the medical emergency as a warning and reduced the pace of his activities. In 2006, he announced he would be taking a year off from touring and recording. In February that year, he was given a Grammy lifetime achievement award, having been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. 
The Next Day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. It contained the single Where Are We Now?, which gave him his first UK top 10 hit since 1993. The album topped charts in Britain and around the world. In 2014, Bowie was given the Brit Award for Best British Male, making him the oldest British recipient in the awards' history. He is survived by Iman, their daughter, Alexandria, his stepdaughter, Zulekha, and his son, Duncan, from his first marriage.

"When night falls over Rwanda, many rural communities far removed from the country's electricity grid descend into darkness.
Unplugged from the power lines, households in these areas rely mainly on fuel-based devices such as kerosene lamps for access to light. Such lanterns, however, are polluting and costly: They emit toxic fumes, pose fire hazards and also put a strain on family budgets.
But recently, an innovative solution has emerged to offer affordable and efficient electricity to low-income households while benefiting the communities by providing jobs to local populations.
Called POWERcycle, Nuru Energy says it has developed the world's first commercially available pedal generator -- a foot or hand-powered device that can recharge up to five modular light emitting diode -LRB- LED -RRB- lamps in approximately 20 minutes, as well as power mobile phones and radios.
The company says each of its portable LED lamps provides one week of light to a rural household. It also claims that its products are more affordable and reliable than other forms of off-grid offerings that have been developed in recent years, including solar lamps or home solar lighting systems.
 We looked around and said, well, what is the one energy resource that's untapped in this environment ? And human power really came to mind, says Sameer Hajee, chief executive and co-founder of Nuru Energy.
 We thought, well, if we can harness human energy in a way that we can create economic opportunity and low-power electricity, would n't that be a game changing solution ? 
Watch: Can handmade bicycles change lives ?
According to Lighting Africa, a joint World Bank - IFC program developed to increase access to clean sources of energy for lighting, 589 million people in the continent live without access to a public electricity facility.
The group says African poor rural households and small businesses pay $10 billion per year for lighting purposes, while communities not connected to the grid spend $4.4 billion annually on kerosene.
Looking to address the issue of energy poverty, Hajee, a social entrepreneur with a lot of experience in international development, spent more than a month in Rwanda in 2008, trying to figure out what were the energy needs of the country's off-grid population.
What he found out was actually quite basic -LSB- energy needs -RSB-, he says. It's light, it's cooking, it's mobile phone recharging and radio. 
With help from the World Bank, Hajee co-founded Nuru Energy and in 2009 the company started testing its products in the field.
Hajee quickly realized, however, that innovative technology was not enough for the project to be successful in a place like rural Rwanda. His company also needed to adopt a creative approach in the distribution front.
 We could n't just sell product -- we had to actually get involved in the value chain downstream, he says. We thought, well, if the generator can recharge five lights so quickly, could this not be the basis of a recharging business for a local entrepreneur ? 
As a result, the company decided not to sell its products directly to customers. Instead, it set up a network of village-level entrepreneurs who are responsible for marketing, selling, and recharging the lights.
Hajee says this unique model of distribution has revolutionized the lives of both micro-entrepreneurs and customers.
 If you look at this from the standpoint of the customer, says Hajee, they would purchase the light for $6 and then they would pay about 20 U.S. cents per week for lighting. This is compared to about $2 a week that they would spend on kerosene before. So it's 10 times cheaper solution for them.
 From the entrepreneur's perspective, in 20 minutes of pedaling, they 're recharging five lights, earning about $1 -- any of us that work in Africa know that that's much more than people make in an entire day. So it's a huge value proposition for the customer and for the entrepreneur. 
Hajee notes that this model can easily be emulated across rural Africa. He says that Nuru Energy, which currently focuses on East Africa and India, has already been approached by a number of potential joint venture partners to roll out the project in other parts of the continent.
 I really hope that what we 're providing here is a stopgap solution to the immediate energy needs of... rural populations, says Hajee. What I would really hope is that, you know, there's certainly effort needed in providing grid quality electricity to these populations. It 'll take some time.

"Five days of gunbattles between the Indian army and separatist militants in Indian-administered Kashmir have left at least 25 dead -- eight Indian army troopers, including one officer, and 17 militants, the Indian military said Tuesday.
An Indian army soldier lays a wreath during the funeral of a slain soldier, northeast of Srinagar on Tuesday.
Defense Minister A.K. Antony, meeting with India's military chiefs in Delhi, reviewed the situation in the Himalayan region and told the Army to deal with the situation in the Himalayan region with utmost firmness. 
Kashmir has been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for nearly two decades during which authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, various NGOs and rights groups put the number of dead at twice the official count.
In Srinigar, Kashmir, Army spokesman Lt. Col. J.S. Brar told CNN the Army was moving against the militants based on sound intelligence inputs as well as human intelligence provided by our own sources. 
The battles in the Shamsbhari forests of north Kashmir Kupwara district have caused minimum collateral damage to property, Brar said.
The spokesman denied media reports that helicopter gunships and heavy weapons had been used by the army during these operations against the militants.
This month's encounter between the Indian Army and the militants is the second longest in Kashmir this year. In January, a fierce encounter raged for seven days in the Poonch district of Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Two soldiers, a policeman and four militants were killed in that encounter.
Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and neighboring Pakistan. Both control parts of the region which is predominantly Muslim.

"Security for Pope Francisvisit to Brazil has been raised after an incident involving his motorcade, a Brazilian federal official told CNN.
The papal visit is now classified at the highest level of security -- it was raised to high risk from medium risk after his car got stuck in a crowd of enthusiastic followers Monday, the official said.
The source says the problem in part stemmed from the pope instructing drivers not to avoid crowds.
After Francis arrived in Brazil on Monday, he got into a silver hatchback Fiat for the drive from the airport to downtown Rio de Janeiro. Along the route, the vehicle became pinned between a bus and a crush of well-wishers who were reaching into the car to touch the pope.
Federal authorities are now taking a larger role in Francissecurity during his time in Brazil.
Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the globe have come to Rio for World Youth Day, a weeklong festival held every two years. The Vatican told reporters that 500,000 people came to Copacabana Beach for the opening ceremony and Mass.. Crowds stretched down the beach for more than half a mile from the main stage.
Brazil: Police found, destroyed bomb before pope's visit
A call for hope
The pope traveled Wednesday morning to the town of Aparecida, the site of a shrine to Our Lady of Aparecida, a clay statue of the Virgin Mary and one of the patron saints of Brazil.
A large crowd -- braving rain -- cheered as the pope emerged from the helicopter that took him to the site, where he held Mass..
In his homily, the pope called on the faithful to find hope in God.
 It is true that nowadays, to some extent, everyone, including our young people, feels attracted by the many idols which take the place of God and appear to offer hope: money, success, power, pleasure, Francis said. Often, a growing sense of loneliness and emptiness in the hearts of many people leads them to seek satisfaction in these ephemeral idols. 
His was an upbeat message, encouraging openness to being surprised by God and proclaiming that Christians can not be pessimists. 
The pope also announced that he will return to Brazil in 2017, the 300th anniversary of the apparition of Our Lady of Aparecida to three fishermen.

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from Central America, many unaccompanied, streaming into the United States.
It represents concrete action over concerns raised by Perry and other Republicans that border security be given more resources generally and specifically in this case to deal with what most agree is a humanitarian crisis.
The White House, which has declined to approve federal authorization of the National Guard in response to the immigration situation that has flared this year, panned Perry's idea as shortsighted and politically motivated.
Here are the questions we wanted to know about Perry's plan.
Why did Perry call on the guard ? Perry said those troops are needed to combat crime because the border patrol is busy dealing with the flow of immigrant kids crossing the border from Mexico.
The National Guard will be a force multiplier to aid state law enforcement to reduce crime from cartels, traffickers and criminals crossing the border, Perry said.
But is n't this a crisis about kids ? Perry said the border patrol is consumed with handling the influx of migrant children and partial family units, who can not be deported but must be humanely treated and cared for according to U.S. law.
If unaccompanied children approach the troops, however, Texas Adjutant General John Nichols, who is head of the Texas National Guard, said they will get on the phone to a border station so that the children will receive water and medical care.
How does that stop the influx ? Perry does n't say that it will. He said he wants to stop border crime.
So what will the border patrol do ? The National Guard troops will refer suspected criminal activity to the Texas Department of Safety. They will also patrol the border by air, especially at night. And they will amass at the border to provide a strong visual that Perry hopes will deter criminals from bringing illicit activity across the border.
What wo n't they do ? The National Guard will not make arrests. If we were asked to, we could detain people, but we 're not planning to, Nichols said.
How much will it cost and who will pay for it ? Texas taxpayers are on the hook, and it will cost about $12 million per month.
Will it work ? The former head of the National Guard and a former commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection bureau have said Perry's plan is limited in scope.
 The real solution to basically helping border patrol is going to be a holistic approach to this that goes way beyond more boots on the ground, said David Aguilar, the acting commissioner of CBP from 2011 until 2013.
Aguilar said one thing that will help relieve the workload of border patrol agents is to relieve CBP from being the sole government agency to process and care for the unaccompanied youth in the immediate aftermath of their detention.
The former chief of the National Guard echoed Aguilar's sentiment.
 That measure alone will not solve the current problem. It is far more complex and it requires a unity approach that incorporates state, local and federal resources, said retired Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum.
When will this take place and for how long ? The troops will be immediately deployed over the next 30 days, according to Nichols. How long they will remain is unknown. Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the National Guard. That part of the plan is up to Congress and the comprehensive immigration plan which would have provided more resources for border security is stalled in the House, and neither body has yet unveiled how they would solve the current border crisis.
Is politics playing a role ? Perry is considering another presidential run in 2016. He previewed his National Guard plan in Iowa, a key presidential nominating state, over the weekend and announced it the next day.
Perry has some reconciling to do within a Republican Party that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue.
CNN political analyst and National Journal editorial director Ron Brownstein said that Perry's focus on border security allows him to shore up his tough on security bona fides in what has become a big moment for the Republican Party on immigration.
Has the National Guard been sent to the border before ? Yes. The National Guard is already on the border but in smaller numbers.
A recent and much larger instance was Operation Jump Start, a two-year deployment that began in 2006 to stem the more than 1 million people who were caught crossing the border each year.
What is the situation on the border ? The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water, which equates to 5.4 agents per mile. The Tucson sector, for instance, has approximately 15.7 agents per mile.
While the number of unaccompanied youth crossing the border has doubled to nearly 60,000 in the past year, the total number of immigrant crossings has mostly declined. About 1 million people have been caught crossing the border nearly every year between 1983 until 2006, but that number has dropped to about 400,000 in 2013.
At the same time, resources for border security have steadily increased: More than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled. The Customs and Border Patrol budget jumped from $5 billion in 2002 to $12.4 billion this year.

"Two car bombs targeting Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad on Christmas.
In Afghanistan, two rounds of indirect fire hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, but no one was hurt.
The incidents highlight the security challenges with which both Iraq and Afghanistan are grappling.
Both countries have had a heavy U.S. military presence until recently.
The departure of U.S. forces from Iraq has done little to curb the near-daily cycle of violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials are working on an important security pact to outline the future of American troops in Afghanistan.
18 dead in Christmas Day attacks near Iraq churches
Iraq attacks
In Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside a church in southern Baghdad just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas Day service, killing many. In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.
Altogether, at least 38 people were killed and some 70 others were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. The bomb outside the church killed 27 and wounded 56. The market attack left 11 dead and 14 wounded.
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks -- in the Dora area of Baghdad -- targeting Christians celebrating Christmas. 
 The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis. The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism, according to a statement released by the embassy.
Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year as tensions simmer between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the Shiites, who dominate the government.
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom notes that many people in small religious minority communities in Iraq, including Christians, have fled the country over the last decade and those that remain are particularly vulnerable, facing discrimination, marginalization, and neglect. 
Sectarian warfare, especially between Sunnis and Shiites, raged during the Iraq War. Half or more of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is thought to have left Iraq, the commission said in its 2013 annual report.
In 2003, there were thought to be 800,000 to 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East members, Syriac Catholics and Orthodox, Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, Protestants and evangelicals in the country, the group said.
Now, according to community leaders, the estimated number of Christians stands at around 500,000, the report said.
Afghanistan attack
Two rounds of indirect fire hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, the embassy said. No one was injured.
 At approximately 6:40 local time in Kabul, approximately two rounds of indirect fire impacted the U.S. Embassy compound. All Americans are accounted for and no injuries were sustained, the embassy said in a statement Wednesday. The Embassy continues to investigate the attack. 
The embassy did not elaborate on what kind of rounds were fired, or where in the compound they landed.
A claim of responsibility was posted on the Taliban's official website. The group said it fired missiles at the U.S. Embassy and the main base of NATO, which leads the military coalition known as the International Security Assistance Force.
The incident comes at a pivotal time in U.S.-Afghan relations. The two countries are working on an important security pact. The deal will lay out the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014 when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave.
This month, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Afghanistan and said the security pact will be agreed upon despite a failure so far to forge a deal.

"How long can you hold your breath? I'm trying it right now. The first 30 seconds are easy. I'm ready to give up at 45 seconds but I push on through and it seems to get easier for a while. But, as the second hand ticks past a minute, I know I'm on borrowed time. My heart is pounding. I let out a tiny breath and this helps. Eventually, I give in, expelling the spent air in my lungs and taking a huge gasp. (And continue to gasp for a few more breaths, prompting my husband to ask what on earth I'm doing.) I manage one minute and 12 seconds. I'm quite impressed with myself. 
Breath-holding ability becomes extremely important in some sports, particularly freediving. In 2006, I was filming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series called, slightly oddly, Don't Die Young. I was lucky enough to meet Sam Amps, who was captain of the UK freedive team. At a pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater. By the end of the session, I think I'd managed a prodigious 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width. Sam swam three widths with ease. She could hold her breath for five minutes, while swimming. Five! 
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in. She also said training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people. 
Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence of a watery episode in human evolution. It's even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breath-hold for even longer. Other anatomical and physiological bits and bobs - our hairlessness, the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs - have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development. Unfortunately, the cobbled-together ""aquatic ape hypothesis"" fails to hold water. It's a romantic notion that may appeal to us but, with the cold light of day falling on the scientific evidence, it's revealed to be nothing more than a fiction. 
Looking at voluntary breath-holding, it turns out that we're certainly not unique among non-aquatic mammals in being able to hold our breath. (Having said that, it's a difficult thing to investigate in other mammals as, unlike humans, they tend not to comply when you ask them to breath-hold.) And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesn't drop during breath-holding. At least, it doesn't if you're breath-holding on land. When you're submerged in cold water it's a different story: cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people. But, once again, this isn't evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry, as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of air-breathing vertebrates. This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the ""mammalian diving reflex"". But physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also - and, perhaps, even more importantly - useful for not drowning. 
While our ability to breath-hold may not be all that special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, it's now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine. Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour. This may require several minutes' worth of radiation and, so, it's usually done in short bursts, between breaths. But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be delivered, in the right place, in one go. The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute. But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have recently performed careful experiments that show that, if patients are ventilated with oxygen-rich air before attempting a breath- hold, they can manage to hold their breath for an impressive five-and-a-half minutes. 
Surprisingly, the trick seems to lie not in fooling the body's usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm. When you breathe in, you're contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it flat so that the volume of your chest increases - and air is drawn into your lungs. When you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state. Artificially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm. And - not so useful if you're trying to keep your chest perfectly still - breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little, and helps you to prolong a breath-hold, exactly as I found when attempting my breath-hold. 
And, so, it's your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breath-hold. Eventually, even if you've fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in - and take a breath.

"Some cities have pigeons. Lima has black vultures or gallinazos. They circle in groups overhead and perch on the city's most emblematic buildings - the decrepit, colonial-era churches and crumbling eighteenth-century piles in the city centre. 
In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the neglect, poverty and filth. But these carrion-eaters' natural affinity for dead and decaying things is being turned into a virtue. Environmental authorities are giving these much- maligned birds a PR makeover, kitting them out with GoPro action video cameras and GPS trackers, and giving them a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the project's ten certified disease- free Coragyps atratus that have been charged with doing what they do best: sniffing out rubbish. Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies clandestine dumps and records the GPS coordinates ona live map. 
His trainer at Lima's Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, beams with admiration. ""They can eat dead animals because their metabolism protects them from viruses and bacteria,"" he says. ""They've got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world."" The effort is a collaboration between USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry to tackle Lima's rubbish problem. 
Samuel's other airborne companions have been given more evocative names: Capitan Huggin, Capitan Fenix (named after the mythological creature that rises from the ashes) and Capitana Aella ( ""Whirlwind""). A tongue- in-cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble"" carthatidae lineage - the vultures"" are pitted against pestilence and disease, while ""humanity is placidly ignoring the danger"". The project makes a serious point. With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are countless illegal dumps. A fifth of the rubbish ends up there, according to the Environment Ministry. Run-off from the waste contaminates Lima's main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima. 
The environmental supervision agency, OEFA, says that three poorer neighbourhoods, despite having only 12% of Lima's population, have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). The problem, in part, is unpaid taxes. Many residents, especially in the barrios , just don't pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities lack the resources for basic services such as rubbish collection. 
It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal rubbish. ""We share the vulture's GPS coordinates with the municipalities,"" says Javier Hernandez, the project director. ""It's their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents."" 
The project aims to encourage citizens to be ""vultures on the ground "": to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illicit dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page. The idea was hatched at the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference, hosted in Lima. ""We were looking for ways to involve not just the authorities but also citizens to generate environmental awareness,"" Hernandez says. Artist Cristina Planas had placed huge, sculpted vulture heads on top of 25 dead palm trees in a wetland reserve in the south of the city. Rich residents hated it as an ugly imposition but Planas invited citizens to ""adopt a vulture"" in support of conservation and recycling. 
""We are a little scared of the vulture's appearance,"" she said. ""But in reality, he is out there sacrificing himself for us. He is out there recycling, in the last place we threw out our rubbish.""  ",C1
"Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff. Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa. Behind them are two barely visible human figures.
 This is a sacred place, says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide from the Kamberg Rock Art Center. Water is important for all life, and it was important for the people who lived here. 
The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa. They were the home of the Bushmen, the original inhabitants of this country, who fled to these mountains to escape other Africans moving down from the north of the continent and white settlers moving up from the Cape. The Bushmen were wiped out in the countless conflicts that resulted.
Scattered throughout these mountains are some 60,000 individual images, visible at about 600 different sites. The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments. The delicate lines of the figures were etched with twigs, porcupine quills and ostrich feathers.
Scientists believe that these figures were created by the Bushmen while they were in trance states, and that the paintings reflect the people's deep reverence for the beauty and power of the natural world that surrounded them.
Higher up the mountain, hidden in a giant overhang at its very crest, is a remarkable fresco of hunters, antelope and mythic figures, known as therianthropes, which are part-human, part-animal beings.
The paintings stretch in a long gallery across the rock face that extends for at least 30 meters under the stone roof. It frames a spectacular view of the tall peaks and the distant valley far below.
 You are not allowed to touch anything, or to collect anything here, it's a like a church, Raphael tells us. And this is why it is important for the Bushman people. Still today many people take their shoes off when they visit here -- as a sign of their respect. 
One of the most well-preserved and mysterious panels in the Kamberg series shows a mythical human-like figure tugging the tail of an eland. Some scientists believe that this a sign of human recreation, almost sport, created by the artist -- or artists -- in a transcendent state of consciousness.
Raphael has been coming here for years, and is now studying rock art through university, but the beauty of this ancient gift left behind by lost generations has not faded for him.
 The Bushmen are very special, he muses while looking out over the wide landscape that stretches out below, because they were living here, peacefully, in the mountains. We are all from the same origins. I feel very proud about this place and of the rock art that is here.

"In the 1950s, Central American commercial banana growers were facing the death of their most lucrative product, the Gros Michel banana, known as Big Mike. And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor - the Cavendish.
With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.
Unfortunately, these conditions are also perfect for the spread of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, which attacks the plant's roots and prevents it from transporting water to the stem and leaves. The TR-1 strain of the fungus was resistant to crop sprays and travelled around on boots or the tyres of trucks, slowly infecting plantations across the region. In an attempt to escape the fungus, farmers abandoned infected fields, flooded them and then replanted crops somewhere else, often cutting down rainforest to do so.
Their efforts failed. So, instead, they searched for a variety of banana that the fungus didn't affect. They found the Cavendish, as it was called, in the greenhouse of a British duke. It wasn't as well suited to shipping as the Gros Michel, but its bananas tasted good enough to keep consumers happy. Most importantly, TR-1 didn't seem to affect it. In a few years, United Fruit had saved itself from bankruptcy by filling its plantations with thousands of the new plants, copying the same monoculture growing conditions Gros Michel had thrived in.
While the operation was a huge success for the Latin American industry, the Cavendish banana itself is far from safe. In 2014, South East Asia, another major banana producer, exported four million tons of Cavendish bananas. But, in 2015, its exports had dropped by 46 per cent thanks to a combination of another strain of the fungus, TR-4, and bad weather.
Growing practices in South East Asia haven't helped matters. Growers can't always afford the expensive lab-based methods to clone plants from shoots without spreading the disease. Also, they often aren't strict enough about cleaning farm equipment and quarantining infected fields. As a result, the fungus has spread to Australia, the Middle East and Mozambique - and Latin America, heavily dependent on its monoculture Cavendish crops, could easily be next.
Racing against the inevitable, scientists are working on solving the problem by genetically modifying the Cavendish with genes from TR-4-resistant banana species. Researchers at the Queensland University of Technology have successfully grown two kinds of modified plant which have remained resistant for three years so far. But some experts think this is just a sophisticated version of the same temporary solution the original Cavendish provided. If the new bananas are planted in the same monocultures as the Cavendish and the Gros Michel before it, the risk is that another strain of the disease may rise up to threaten the modified plants too.",C1
"The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, more commonly known as the Veterans Administration, is an organization dedicated to provide services for all veterans of the U.S. military. It was formed in July 1930, and today employs approximately 280,000 people at hundreds of its offices throughout the U.S. Its annual budget for the 2014 fiscal year is nearly $153 billion, making it one of the largest government agencies in existence today.
 
The Department is broken into three main subdivisions. It consists of the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to help veterans in areas such as guaranteed home loans, insurance vocational rehabilitation and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration provides burial and memorial benefits, and is entrusted with the maintenance of the VA's cemeteries.
The VA has served U.S. veterans from several wars beginning with survivors of World War I. It has continued the tradition of serving former military members by providing services for those veterans who need help readjusting to civilian life. Many of these veterans, especially those who saw combat during their time in the military, are in need of basic medical services for wounds suffered in conflicts. This was the original concept for the creation of the VA.
Since that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended. There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today. That number represents nearly 10 percent of the population of the country today.",C1
"Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday.
Residents of Iraq's Ramadi province cast their votes this weekend during provincial elections.
The turnout of 7.5 million voters starkly contrasted with elections in 2005, when the violence and intimidation of al Qaeda in Iraq kept voters away from the polls and only 2 percent of eligible voters participated.
Faraj al-Haidari, the head of the Independent High Electoral Commission, called the turnout this year very high for provincial elections in any country. Fifty-one percent of the 14.9 million registered voters cast ballots.
Al-Haidari called the weekend voting the most important elections in the history of Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
Voting was held in 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces. The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said.
The lowest -- 40 percent -- was in Anbar, the Sunni heartland west of Baghdad. The sprawling desert area was dominated in 2005 by al Qaeda in Iraq.
Preliminary results from the electoral commission are expected within five days. Final numbers are due at the end of February.
CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with U.N. observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and country.
Political analysts said this election could correct some of the political imbalances that resulted from the 2005 election. Saturday's voting also was seen as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
 We are trying to build a new system of government in the heart of the Islamic Middle East, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh told CNN.
 The overwhelming majority of the people of Iraq are having a stake in this process, are buying into this democratic process. 
Those elected will have regional power over the essentials Iraqis have been desperate for -- basic services and jobs, Damon reported.
Observers believe the provincial vote will be a gauge of the country's political direction and an indication of how the parliamentary elections will turn out later this year.
The results should spell out the status of the Sunni Arab Awakening movement -- which opposes al Qaeda in Iraq -- and the popularity of the Shiite factions, such as those backing al-Maliki, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
Officials set up tough counter-terror measures for the election, including security rings around polling stations and vigorous searches of voters.
Despite the heightened security, three mortars exploded near a polling station in central Tikrit, about 100 miles -LRB- 160 kilometers -RRB- north of Baghdad, on Saturday morning, an official with the Interior Ministry told CNN. There were no casualties.
In another incident in Tikrit, police detained four people wearing Iraqi police uniforms who they said had thrown stun grenades at voters outside a polling center.

"Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that the mobile phone network can't process data and there isn't a single ATM or credit-card machine on the island. Before Greece was plunged into financial chaos, residents of this tranquil outpost in the northern Aegean managed quite well. They did their banking at the post office and the few dozen rooms to rent were booked out every summer with people who had heard - by word of mouth - of its spectacular empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood. 
But, because the island still runs on cash, the closure of banks nationwide has been devastating. Residents have been forced to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they can't get together enough money to come. ""Tourist numbers are down 80% this year,"" said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an office in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people. ""Even people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, aren't coming."" 
Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may come too late for this season on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income: fishing and agriculture: ""We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to find a room and we can't help them."" A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved by 50 workers billeted in the village to expand the harbour but there is an even bigger crisis looming because the government has said it will end a decades-old tax break for islands. 
Created to help island communities survive when they were suffering mass emigration, a lower sales tax contained the costs of living in places where everything had to be imported and made tourism more affordable. Tourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey but, for Agios Efstratios, it poses a far greater threat. ""If we have to pay a tax of 23%, I'm sorry to say it but we will all die on the island,"" says Kakali. 
Food and fuel are already more expensive than on the mainland, there are no economies of scale and little economic flexibility on an island which, even in summer, has only three shops, two restaurants and not a single official hotel. ""This is an expensive island. Everything, even milk or bread, has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a profit,"" said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old fisherman. 
For Agios Efstratios and its closest large neighbour, Lemnos, the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel. They were condemned to relative obscurity for years in part because they are served by slow and unreliable ferries. In 2015, the government had finally given the contract to a new, efficient company, drawing floods of new visitors to explore the islands' largely overlooked charms, before the bank controls hit. 
""It started out as the best season in 30 years and, in one week, became the worst,"" said Atzamis Konstantinos, a travel agent in Lemnos who used to earn EUR15,000 a month as a captain of petroleum tankers and other large ships but came home because he missed it so much. ""I always loved this island, even when I was young. I would dock in Piraeus, the port in Athens, take my pay, then get the first boat over. People would say 'You're crazy. You can go anywhere' but I only ever wanted to come here."" 
Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where even at the height of summer you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene and numerous cultural sites. It is the eighth largest island in Greece so is in line for the first round of tax increases in autumn 2015 but far less wealthy than many smaller ones. It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors, compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes. Its councillors say that they will fight the tax rise, although none can say how. ""We have been suffering economically in recent years and, now, we will suffer more,"" said Lemnos Mayor, Dimitris Marinakis. ""When there is not enough money, you reduce your consumption and therefore the whole economy declines."" 
The crisis has been particularly hard on people under 40, who often do two or three jobs to make ends meet and still feel they can't afford a family. Young people fear they are losing their contemporaries in an exodus to match the one that scattered their grandparents' friends to America, Australia and Canada. ""What is the future for our generation?"" said Katerina Fikari, who feels she is extremely lucky to work for the local government in Lemnos. ""If you work only to pay your bills, how can you have dreams for your future?"" 
If taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has devoted her year in office to improving education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families. Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the rise is due to come in, so Kakali hopes that the roller coaster of Greek politics means it yet may be spared. If not, though, she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost. 
""The truth is the government doesn't pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean,"" she said, ""so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: 'There is still life in these islands'.""

"What is it like to look at the very last of something? To contemplate the passing of a unique wonder that will soon vanish from the face of the earth? Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet. If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more of their kind, male or female, born anywhere. And it seems a slim chance, as Sudan is getting old at 42 and breeding efforts have so far failed. Apart from these three animals, there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female. 
It seems an image of human tenderness that Sudan is lovingly guarded by armed men who stand vigilantly and caringly with him. But, of course, it is an image of brutality. Even at this last desperate stage in the fate of the northern white rhino, Sudan is under threat from poachers who kill rhinos and hack off their horns to sell them on the Asian medicine market - despite the fact that he has had his horn cut off to deter them. 
Sudan doesn't know how precious he is. His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards. His head is a marvellous thing. It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery flesh, a head that expresses pure strength. How terrible that such a mighty head can, in reality, be so vulnerable. It is lowered melancholically beneath the sinister sky, as if weighed down by fate. This is the noble head of an old warrior, his armour battered, his appetite for struggle fading. 
Under his immense looming shoulder, his legs protrude like squat columns from the tough tank of his body. The way his foreleg emerges from his thick coat of skin reminds us how long human beings have been wondering at the natural spectacle that is the rhino. For Sudan does not look so different from the rhinoceros that Albrecht Durer portrayed in 1515. They have the same little legs stuck out of a majestic body and they even lower their heads in the same contemplative way. Durer was a Renaissance artist picturing an exotic beast from the exotic lands that Europe was starting to see more and more of. In 1515, a live Indian rhinoceros was sent by the ruler of Gujarat in India to the king of Portugal: he in turn sent it to the Pope but, on the way, it died in a shipwreck. 
Human beings - we always kill the things we love. We have been doing so since the Ice Age. There are beautiful pictures of European woolly rhinos in caves in France that were painted up to 30,000 years ago. These ancient relatives of Sudan share his heroic bulk, mighty power and paradoxical air of gentleness. A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems agile and young, a creature full of life. But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off. As climate turned against the woolly megafauna with the end of the last Ice Age, human spears probably delivered the coup de grace. 
Today, immense love is invested in rhinos, yet they are being slaughtered in ever greater numbers. The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino. There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos. But the demand in some countries for rhino horn as a traditional medicine believed to cure everything from flu to cancer is fuelling a boom in poaching. From 2007, when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the killings have grown horrifically. In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa. 2015 already looks certain to beat that dreadful record. 
The vulnerable northern white rhino has been hunted virtually to extinction - in spite of every precaution, in spite of the guards and their guns - and other varieties of African rhino are under a sustained attack from poachers that is totally out of control. The Javan rhinoceros is also on the verge of extinction. India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros after it was almost wiped out by British hunters in colonial times but here, too, poaching is a menace. What a majestic creature and what futile human destructiveness. Have we learned nothing since the Ice Age?

"Jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial continued Saturday afternoon following the rejection of nine potential jurors, including one man who posted to his Facebook account that he had a title, cover and all ready for a book about the case.
Attorneys and Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. of the Orange County Superior Court had allowed four potential jurors through from questioning by day's end, one a 22-year-old man who said he paid no attention to the news and another a grandmother of a 2-year-old girl who described herself as firm and fair. 
Anthony, 25, is charged with capital murder in the death of her daughter, 2-year-old Caylee, whose body was found in woods near her family's home in 2008. She has pleaded not guilty.
She faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement.
Jury selection is occurring at the Pinellas County courthouse. Candidates were questioned Saturday about everything from their news-watching habits to criminal records.
After questioning and quickly dismissing five jurors Saturday morning for reasons ranging from financial hardship to bias, lawyers and the judge began questioning a 22-year-old man who said he does n't follow the news because it's just awful. 
Assistant State's Attorney Jeff Ashton questioned whether the man would be able to bear the grim details of the case.
 You 've already told us you live your life avoiding unpleasant things like the news, Ashton said. Are you absolutely sure you can do it ? 
 Yes, sir, the candidate replied.
 No doubt in your mind ? Ashton asked.
 No, sir, the man replied.
When asked by lead defense attorney Jose Baez whether his decision would be influenced if Anthony declines to testify on her own behalf, the candidate said I can definitely understand not wanting to be up here. 
The line elicited laughter from nearly everyone in the courtroom, including Anthony.
Anthony's lead defense attorney sought to have the man dismissed for failing to disclose an entanglement with the law over apparent marijuana possession, but the judge refused. He was ordered to stand by for possible duty.
Perry later approved the dismissal of a man who posted on his Facebook page what the potential juror said was a joking reference to a book coming soon after announcing he had been called for potential jury duty on a big trial.
 Already have the title, cover and all, Assistant State's Attorney Frank George said in reciting one of the posts.
Also dismissed was a woman who said she had lost a son in a car accident that required an extensive police investigation. She said she viewed the charge that Anthony had lied to investigators as evidence of guilt by omission. 
During the afternoon session, Perry dismissed a man who said he was irrevocably opposed to the death penalty.
After extensive questioning by attorneys, he told a grandmother who remembered sweet pictures of Caylee but said she had no preconceived notions of the case to stand by for duty.
The two other jurors who will be contenders for the final jury pool are a woman in her 60s who does n't own a computer, and a 43-year-old man who said that while he's occasionally seen newspaper headlines that suggest Anthony is guilty, he said he is able to set that aside.
 I 've also read that Donald Trump is an alien, and that Elvis is still alive and living in Graceland, the man said.
At the end of the rare Saturday session around 5:30 p.m., the judge said the court would be in recess until 8:30 a.m. Monday.
In allowing the four candidates Saturday to pass to the next phase, the judge and attorneys increased the pool of potential jurors who have not been dismissed for one reason or another to 12, although attorneys still have until the jurors are sworn in to seek their dismissal, according to the judge.
Perry said he would begin swearing in jurors once the number of unrejected candidates reaches 15.
Coming into Saturday's session, eight people were considered viable candidates for the jury.
Twelve jurors and eight alternates will eventually be seated on the jury, which will be moved to and sequestered in Orange County, where the alleged crime happened and where the trial will take place.
Jury selection was moved from Orlando to Clearwater amid intense media coverage of the case, which could make it difficult to select an impartial jury.
Perry said Friday that it is imperative to seat a jury as quickly as possible before more potential jurors are swayed by the media coverage.
 The longer we wait, the more dangers there are, he said.
The goal is to have everything finalized for opening arguments Tuesday in Orlando.
Prosecutors have said they plan to show Anthony used a substance to kill her daughter. The girl's skeletal remains were found in December 2008 in woods near the Anthony home after she went missing for six months.

"It sounds more like schoolyard taunting than a debate involving presidential power, negotiating with terrorists and bringing home a captured American soldier.
Political leaders escalated their rhetoric and raised new arguments on Tuesday about the secret deal that obtained the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo Bay.
The controversy touches on a range of volatile issues -- ending the Afghanistan war, releasing Guantanamo detainees, accusations by members of Bergdahl's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the seemingly maximized partisan divide in Washington.
Costs from swap will include lost lives 
House Speaker John Boehner, a leading Republican voice, told reporters he had no doubt that there are going to be costs, lost lives associated with what came out of this, calling the swap a de facto deal with Taliban terrorists.
On the Democratic side, Senate allies of President Barack Obama said the deal mediated by the government of Qatar came together too quickly to consult with Congress over an exchange that critics from both parties have labeled too costly.
 All I can tell you is this: -LRB- the government -RRB- knew a day ahead of time that the transfer was going to take place. They knew an hour ahead of time where it was going to take place, said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, while his Democratic colleague from Michigan, Carl Levin, noted the military's top leadership fully backed the exchange.
 Whether you agree with them or not, its critically important that the American people know that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs strongly recommended this agreement knowing full well Bergdahl, one, had left his unit and knowing full well how bad these Taliban people were, Levin said.
The dispute involves both the dynamics of the exchange and the endless argument between the executive and legislative branches over presidential powers.
Legal requirement or courtesy ?
Members of both parties complain the Obama administration should have let Congress know ahead of time that the exchange was taking place. Some cite the 30 daysnotice called for by the National Defense Authorization Act, while others say a simple heads-up would have sufficed.
 It's just a matter of courtesy, whether it was in law or not, said conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a regular critic of the President. A matter of this importance should have been discussed with at least key leaders in the Congress. 
Administration officials say the deal came together quickly, and the risks to Bergdahl and the military commandos involved in collecting him near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border required keeping the exchange top-secret.
 This was a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of Sergeant Bergdahl but also the lives of the American servicemen who were involved in the mission, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. So discretion on this matter was important. 
However, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon of California called such reasoning for not notifying Congress absurd. 
 Nothing in the law requires the Secretary of Defense to disclose the physical details of the transfer, said McKeon, a Republican. They are merely required to notify us in a classified manner that a transfer will take place, and of the conditions set to prevent a terrorist from re-entering the fight. 
Boehner noted that he was briefed as early as six months before another significant and secret military mission -- the 2011 raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
 I was given a heads-up several days before the bin Laden mission, Boehner said. So this idea that they could n't trust us to not leak things is just not true. 
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate from West Virginia known for criticizing the administration at times, said his main concern was the release of five Taliban figures who could return to the battlefield against U.S forces and interests.
Who was swapped for Bergdahl ?
Congressman: Deal gives no guaranteeTaliban figures will be tracked
Under the exchange, the released Taliban detainees were taken to Qatar, where the government says it will keep them under watch for at least a year.
But some lawmakers fear there's no guarantee.
 How we are sure that the Qataris are going to do what they are supposed to do and we are able to keep -LRB- the released Taliban figures -RRB- from engaging again, Manchin told reporters.
A memorandum of understanding between the United States and Qatar on the deal that freed Bergdahl offered no guarantee that the five Taliban commanders exchanged for the captured Army sergeant would be tracked, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN.
Rep. Adam Schiff reviewed the agreement and said, based on his reading, that it is possible the former U.S. detainees might disappear even during the first year in Qatar. 
Schiff told CNN's Jim Sciutto that the United States has some capability to track them while in Qatar, but after the first year, he said, all bets are off.
 We have to expect them to return to the fight, Schiff said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the swap in an interview with CNN over the weekend, saying the former detainees would be monitored closely, and not just by officials in Qatar. He would n't say who else will be watching, but he said the United States is confident the conditions of their release will be honored.
National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Tuesday that the Obama administration had received assurances from Qatar during the deal.
 We have acknowledged that some of these individuals could attempt to return to activities that are of concern. The President said so explicitly on his trip last week, she said. But we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses. 
Democrats complain about lack of notice
Administration officials gave a classified briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday after a similar session on Monday with House members.
On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will appear before McKeon's armed services committee to discuss the exchange, which he signed off on as the Pentagon chief.
 He looks forward to explaining why the President's decision to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl was the right one, and why the process we undertook in doing so was in keeping with our national interests, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.
After the briefing to House members, some said they were told as many as 80 to 90 administration officials knew of the pending exchange ahead of time, while Congress did not.
Earnest told reporters the figure of 80 to 90 officials discussed in the classified briefing referred to the number with knowledge of intelligence involving Taliban activities in Qatar. The number of administration officials who knew ahead of time of the Bergdahl swap was smaller, Earnest said, but he refused to provide a specific figure.
Schiff told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront that White House officials should have told congressional leaders, even if the law gave them wiggle room.
 I think the President had the constitutional authority... to make this decision without consulting with Congress, Schiff said. But I think it would have been wiser, far wiser, for the administration to have notified, certainly the leadership of Congress in the interest of having good relations. 
Polls show divide, with more disapproving
More Americans disapprove than approve of Bergdahl's release in exchange for five Taliban detainees, according to two new national polls.
The surveys also indicate a wide partisan divide, with most Republicans opposing the deal while most Democrats approve of it.
Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.
An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report.
The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN.
The prisoner exchange has become a political football, with Republicans who once called for the administration to work for Bergdahl's return now saying the cost was too high.
Was Rand Paul's red meat joke a bit too raw ?
Slow recovery
Bergdahl is continuing to improve every day as he recovers at a military hospital in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said Monday, but he has n't spoken with his family yet.
The decision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call, Warren said.
When he is ready, Bergdahl will be flown to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he may be able to reunite with his parents.
As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity.
Citing an American official, The New York Times reported Sunday that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage.
CNN reported Friday that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse.
Obama:I make absolutely no apologiesfor Bergdahl swap

"Can a movie actually convince you to support torture ? Can a movie really persuade you that fracking -- a process used to drill for natural gas -- is a danger to the environment ? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light ?
Some scoff at the notion that movies do anything more than entertain. They are wrong. Sure, it's unlikely that one movie alone will change your views on issues of magnitude. But a movie -LRB- or TV show -RRB- can begin your education or miseducation on a topic. And for those already agreeing with the film's thesis, it can further entrench your views.
Anyone who doubts the potential influence that movies can have on public opinion need to look no further than two films that are causing an uproar even before they have opened nationwide. They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right.
The first, Zero Dark Thirty, is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture. The second, Promised Land, stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers.
Critics of Zero Dark Thirty fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden. They are rightfully concerned that the film will sway some to become more receptive or even supportive of the idea of torturing prisoners.
Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden ?
Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators -- John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein -- sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as grossly inaccurate and misleading. The senators bluntly informed Sony Pictures that it has an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative. 
The hostility toward Promised Land shows us that it's not just politicians who complain about movie messages. Big business -- namely, the gas industry -- is aggressively objecting to the allegation in Promised Land that fracking poses environmental and health risks.
How concerned is the gas industry ?
It has set up a rapid response team to counter publicity for the film by using two Washington-based groups that lobby for gas and oil companies: the Independent Petroleum Association of America and Energy in Depth. These groups have scrutinized appearances by the films stars on talk shows, questioned who the financiers of the film are, published parts of the script and mocked the film on social media.
Energy in Depth went as far as to fact check a recent appearance by the film's co-star and co-writer, John Krasinski, on Late Night With David Letterman. Within hours of Krasinski's appearance, Energy in Depth posted a blog on its website pointing out what it perceived as factual errors made by Krasinski about fracking.
Regardless of whether Zero Dark Thirty and Promised Land intended to promote any message, people who watch them will be educated in some way on torture and fracking -- even if very subtly.
This is the same reason that minority groups continue to object to being represented in a negative light in movies and TV. They understand that accurate representations matter because studies have shown that biases can form based on stereotypes or inaccurate representations. -LRB- Being of Italian and Arab descent, I 'm acutely aware of this issue as my respective heritages have been represented by a parade of mobsters and terrorists. -RRB-
What's Hollywood's role in all of this ? The same as it has always been -- to make money.
In fact, there's no doubt that the studios behind these movies are overjoyed at the controversy that has erupted and the resulting free press. Indeed, the response of Sony Pictures to the uproar over Zero Dark Thirty tells you about what they really hope we will all do: We encourage people to see the film before characterizing it. 
So go ahead, enjoy these films and ones like them that are based on actual events or current hot issues. But while you are watching them, be aware you might be getting more than the price of ticket. You might also be getting a -LRB- mis -RRB- education.

"As Halloween approaches, my 10-year-old daughter is getting excited about choosing a scary costume for trick-or-treating and the prospect of a bucket full of sweets.
I usually accompany her, but this year has stirred memories of a genuinely spooky encounter, re-awakened by a recent assignment for CNN.
The British Film Institute is about to release the full 144-minute version of The Shining -- 24 minutes more than previously seen in Europe. If you 're of a nervous disposition, the thought of subjecting yourself to additional minutes of what many regard as the most terrifying movie ever made might be a less than appealing one. But true horror fans are licking their lips in anticipation.
The film -- directed by the brilliant Stanley Kubrick in 1980 -- is now regarded as a masterclass in movie-making but at the time it was largely received with the scratching of heads and a mood of disappointment.
Kubrick adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist Stephen King -- and that's where my connection begins.
In 1974 King and his wife stayed at the majestic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, a small town at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The hotel was due to shut down for the winter season and the Kings were the only guests in the place, echoing round the long empty corridors and silent ballroom. By the time they checked out of Room 217 the next morning -- Halloween - King had the bones of his chilling story.
Stanley Kubrick treasures on display
I visited Estes Park 34 years later and decided to take my family to the Stanley Hotel.
Although Kubrick's film was shot at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon -LRB- exteriors -RRB- and Elstree studios near London -LRB- interiors -RRB- the resemblance is uncanny.
Our guide told us the hotel was inhabited by a number of ghosts, sometimes appearing in photographs as balls of energy. The warning was met with a mixture of giggles and suspiciously raised eyebrows.
We were about to shuffle along another carpeted corridor when my wife gave a cry of surprise: Look at this ! 
We gathered round her camera to see an image of the staircase on which were three orbs of light -- different sizes, different opacities, different to anything I 'd ever seen before. They had n't appeared to the naked eye nor had they appeared on anyone else's camera.
During the rest of the tour our group achieved a degree of minor celebrity by repeating the feat at several other locations within the hotel. There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide.
The images were taken in different places, with very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our holiday no orbs appeared on any other photograph -- nor indeed on any photograph ever taken on that camera before or since. We were amused and baffled but promptly forgot about them when we returned to London.
This month, covering the story of the extended version of The Shining came my way and while researching it I remembered the photographs.
So when I went to interview the film's executive producer Jan Harlan at his home in the ancient English city of St. Albans, an hour's drive north of London, I took them with me. He talked eloquently about Kubrick and his movie.
 It was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity. And this is what Stanley wanted, he said.
I showed him the pictures. He seemed amused but like me could offer no plausible explanation. They too remain ambiguous and I 'm happy for them to remain so.
But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories. Some claim to have discovered hidden messages about anything from the Holocaust to the plight of Native Americans, and to Kubrick's apparent use of the film to confess to helping the U.S. government fabricate the Apollo moon landings.
 It's amazing how this film invited speculation and fantasy in the audience. Which is good, said Harlan. It's a great compliment to Kubrick that people go into orbit about it. 
 Orbit eh ? Is that another deliberate clue... no, I 'm not going down that road. I 'll stick to my own photographs instead. And if there is anyone out there with a good theory -LRB- conspiratorial or otherwise -RRB- about those we 'd love to hear from you.

"Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Wednesday declared victory over fellow Republican Joe Miller in the nation's last Senate race, saying the result of her write-in candidacy was a miracle. 
 Against all odds, we as Alaskans together made history, Murkowski told cheering supporters in Anchorage.
If she prevails in a potential challenge, Murkowski would become the second person to ever win a write-in bid for the U.S. Senate.
Murkowski's statement was the climax in the state's bitter and prolonged Senate battle. It was essentially a triumphant declaration of beating back a three-pronged attack: from Miller, from the Tea Party Express, and from Sarah Palin.
 We 've said all along, we 'll wait for the votes to be counted, Murkowski Campaign Manager Kevin Sweeney told CNN.
 By any standard, this was a clear victory. This was a whuppin, Sweeney added.
Currently, Alaska's Division of Elections is counting 100,868 votes for Murkowski versus 90,448 for Miller. By that count, Murkowski leads by 10,420.
However, 8,153 of Murkowski's votes have been contested by the Miller campaign. If, as Miller's side would like, all of those contested votes are thrown out -- an almost impossible scenario to many election and legal observers -- Murkowski would still win the race with the uncontested votes alone.
 You can see that the numbers just wo n't add up, Sweeney told CNN, referring to Miller's hopes of pulling out a win despite the rising tide against him.
The Associated Press has called the race for Murkowski. If the outcome stands in the face of legal challenges, despite a count of any outstanding ballots or a potential recount from Miller, it would be only the second time a person won a write-in campaign for the Senate. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina won a write-in campaign in 1954.
At this point, Miller is conceding nothing.
In an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, Miller said he is less cautiously optimistic given the vote tallies. But Miller was emphatic about ensuring the integrity of the vote-counting process, asserting that the difference was less than 1 percent. 
He said he may request a recount, that he wants to ensure that some military ballots were mailed out, and that the difference between his votes and Murkowski's may shift if a consistent standard for evaluating the write-in ballots is applied.
Evaluating the write-in ballots has been controversial. As Alaska's Division of Elections tallied them, some ballots that contained misspellings or variations of Lisa Murkowski have been credited as votes for her.
That issue of evaluating a voter's intent has infuriated the Miller campaign, prompting it to launch a federal lawsuit in hopes of annulling the count of misspelled or incongruous ballots. Miller's campaign blasted the Division of Electionsstandards as extraordinarily ambiguous. 
A Miller loss would be a huge slap to Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit. Murkowski lost the primary in August -- and conceded the race. Shortly after, Murkowski launched a write-in bid to retain her seat.
Murkowski was first appointed to her post by her father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, in 2002. Palin defeated him in the 2006 GOP gubernatorial primary.

"Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana Air's operating license Tuesday as torrential rain hampered recovery efforts after a deadly weekend plane crash.
 As soon as we have concluded the recertification of the airline, if they are capable, then their license will be reinstated, said Sam Adurogboye, a spokesman for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.
Authorities have recovered the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, which are expected to help investigators determine what caused Sunday's crash that authorities say killed at least 153 people aboard the plane and at least 10 people on the ground.
Rescuers have recovered 153 bodies, including those of a woman and the baby she was clutching. But a downpour and a building on the verge of collapse impeded recovery efforts Tuesday.
Rescuers said they hoped to resume work Wednesday morning.
Seven U.S. citizens were aboard the flight, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday. Officials were working to notify relatives of the dead.
Two sisters from Texas, Connecticut family perish
Dana Air's Flight 0992 slammed into a two-story residential building in a densely populated neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city.
 The plane pushed the wall of our building in, and it hit everything, said Kingsley Okeke, who was inside at the time. There was fire everywhere. 
The pilot declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it appeared the plane was having engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations.
Wason identified the pilot as Peter Waxtan, an American, and the first officer as Mike Mahendra, from India.
Waxtan had joined Dana Air on March 26. He was a captain for Spirit Airlines based in South Florida from 1997 to 2009, the airline said.
He also flew for Falcon Air Express, a charter airline in Miami, CNN affiliate WPEC reported.
Sisters Jennifer and Josephine Onita of Missouri City, Texas, were among those killed in the crash. They were on their way back home after attending a wedding, said their sister, Christiana Onita-Olojo.
Also among the dead were six Chinese citizens who were on the plane, the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria said Monday.
According to witnesses, the passenger plane appeared to be approaching the vicinity of the airport in Lagos high, its nose tilted upward, when it crashed 11 miles -LRB- 18 kilometers -RRB- north of the runway, hitting the ground tail first, Wason said.
The flight, which had originated in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, crashed at 3:43 p.m. in the neighborhood of Iju Ishaga, according to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.

The airplane was 22 years old and had been purchased from Alaska Airlines. It had undergone routine maintenance checkups after every 200 hours of flight, and it had been inspected three days before the crash, Wason said.
Dana Air says its fleet comprises Boeing MD-83 aircraft. Boeing's website says that model can carry 155 to 172 passengers, cover up to 2,504 nautical miles and has a fuel capacity of 7,000 gallons.
The airline, which is privately owned and based in Lagos, began operations in 2008.

"It's the largest producer of cocaine in the world and a key supplier of heroin to the United States.
According to the CIA, Colombia produces 535 metric tons of cocaine a year, most of it for the U.S. market. The South American country has retained its status as key cocaine producer in spite of an ambitious anti-drug agreement launched a decade ago with the financial support of the United States.
The agreement is called Plan Colombia. 
Since 2000, the plan has cost the United States $7 billion, according to the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank that has closely monitored the implementation of Plan Colombia.
The money has been mostly used to help Colombia strengthen its police and military. Before the implementation of Plan Colombia, 50 % of the Colombian territory did n't have a government security presence.
Marta Lucia Ramirez, a former Colombian minister of defense and one of the architects of Plan Colombia, says the agreement has helped her country to strengthen democracy and government institutions. It has also increased the Colombian government's ability to fight what she calls narco-terrorism. 
But Ramirez also says that the high drug demand in the U.S. makes it difficult to eradicate production at home.
 I really believe that the American strategy against drugs is not enough. It's probably a failure. It's -LSB- a policy -RSB- that they have to review, says Ramirez.
Colombia welcomes U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske this week. Kerlikowske, in his role as director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, will do a progress evaluation of plan Colombia as part of his trip.
Ahead of his visit, Kerlikowske told the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo that he sees a commitment on the part of the government of President Juan Manuel Santos, who took office in August.
 We 're going to talk about the continuation of the relationship between both countries, not only in terms of reduction but also in terms of prevention and demand, said Kerlikowske.
Security experts, including Colombian Aurelio Suarez, say Plan Colombia has improved security, but it has fallen short on its original goal of reducing drug production in the region. In what is known as the balloon effect, increased army attacks against drug traffickers in Colombia has moved coca and poppy crops elsewhere.
 And the quantity of the drug production from the Andean countries like Bolivia, Peru and Colombia is the same as 10 years ago, says Suarez.
Salud Hernandez, a journalist who has traveled extensively in areas where coca is grown, has witnessed the balloon effect. She says drug traffickers just move to other countries, but also relocate within Colombia.
 There are still drug dealers -LSB- in Colombia -RSB-. There's still a lot of drug trafficking, and there are still a lot of crops in many regions of the country, says Hernandez.
What's even more troublesome, the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue says that roughly 90 % of cocaine sold in the United States still comes from Colombia.
Michael Shifter, the organization's president, says that Plan Colombia's many critics rightly point to the policy's failure to meet the fundamental purpose for which the program was developed: To reduce the availability of drugs, particularly cocaine in U.S. communities, says Shifter.
In Colombia there's a new push to refocus government efforts on improving socioeconomic conditions for the population as a means of making organized crime and guerrillas associated with drug traffickers less appealing to peasants who live in marginalized areas. Colombia's problems go well beyond drug trafficking and security.
About 50 % of Colombians live in poverty, and 60 % have no regular employment. Now that security has improved, many Colombians such as security analyst Suarez say it's time for the Colombian government to address issues such as social inequality and long-term development as a way to slow down the seemingly never-ending production of illicit drugs in Colombia.

"The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door. 
Yet, for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty. 
But, after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan's ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days' paid holiday a year. 
Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days' paid holiday a year - only two fewer than the global average - with a minimum of ten days, as well as 15 one-day national holidays. In reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5-day average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers in Japan have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence. 
The move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance. 
By the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days' paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25. 
Japan's unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else. 
Japan's low birth rate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork. 
Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office or workshop or on the factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today's workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s. 
About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. At 35%, South Korea's workaholics are even worse off. 
In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six of which counted as sick leave. ""Nobody else uses their vacation days,"" Sekiguchi said. 
She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan: never to take time off to recharge or to risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch. 
Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one's colleagues, hour for hour. ""It is a worker's right to take paid vacations,"" Wakebe said. ""But working in Japan involves quite a lot of volunteer spirit."" 
That fear of being ostracized at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules. 
The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalized market. Japan's working culture, Abe said recently, ""falsely beatifies long hours"".",C1
"DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists an unprecedented glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming. The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic make-up. 
He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took up tools in the first agricultural revolution. The invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and humans likely evolved more robust immune systems to fend off infections that the animals passed on. But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherer's DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs. Some live on in modern Europeans today. ""Before we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to find,"" said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. ""Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong."" 
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. The human remains, which belonged to two men in their early 30s, had been extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave. Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East. The timing fitted with ancient artefacts found at the site, including perforated reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the people's clothing. 
The scientists focused their efforts on the better preserved of the two skeletons. After several failed attempts, they managed to reconstruct the man's entire genome from DNA found in the root of a third molar. It is the first time researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution. 
The DNA threw up a series of surprises. When Lalueza-Fox looked at the genome, he found that, rather than having light skin, the man had gene variants that tend to produce much darker skin. ""This guy had to be darker than any modern European, but we don't know how dark,"" the scientist said. 
Another surprise fi nding was that the man had blue eyes. That was unexpected, said Lalueza-Fox, because the mutation for blue eyes was thought to have arisen more recently than the mutations that cause lighter skin colour. The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe, with the transition to lighter skin ongoing through Mesolithic times. 
On top of the scientific impact, artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people. ""You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour,"" Lalueza-Fox said. 
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. They found that the ancient DNA most closely matched the genetic make-up of people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland. 
The discovery of mutations that bolstered the immune system against bacteria and viruses suggests that the shift to a farming culture in Neolithic times did not drive all of the changes in immunity genes that Europeans carry today. At least some of those genetic changes have a history that stretches further back. ""One thing we don't know is what sort of pathogens were affecting these people,"" said Lalueza-Fox. 
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most striking result. ""There is a no doubt oversimplified grand narrative that the move from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled farming was initially bad for our health. A number of factors contributed, particularly living closely together with other humans and animals, shrinking the food web and crowding out water supplies. The authors are drawing attention to the role of pathogens in pre-agricultural lives and that is interesting.""

"Tribal fighters took control of a top Yemeni city on Tuesday, a setback for an embattled government whose wounded president is hospitalized in Saudi Arabia.
More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said.
Government forces have been regrouping in an effort to re-enter the city. Yemen's government has faced international criticism for excessive use of force against anti-regime protesters and the deaths of anti-government demonstrators in Taiz.
Are you in Yemen ? Share your photos and videos from the scene, but please stay safe.
Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40 % of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said.
Whether he will return to Yemen remained uncertain.
Saleh was wounded Friday in an attack at his presidential compound. An Arab diplomatic source with knowledge of Saleh's condition said one shrapnel wound was 7 centimeters -LRB- 2.75 inches -RRB- deep.
Fighting between government and tribal forces has been raging in the capital of Sanaa, where thousands of anti-government protesters have been pressuring Saleh to give up power since January. And there has been unrest elsewhere.
At least 15 people were killed in Abyan Monday night and Tuesday morning in clashes between Islamic militants and security forces, according to a security source in Abyan.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has a presence in the southern province of Abyan, a U.S. official said. It's also home to an Islamic militant movement that has targeted government troops in recent days.
The Abyan dead include nine soldiers, four militants and two civilians in Zinjibar and other suburbs in the province, according to the source, who asked to not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
There was also violence along the Saudi-Yemeni border, where there have long been concerns of infiltration by militants.
A man trying to cross into Yemen from Saudi Arabia early Tuesday fatally shot two security officers and wounded another, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said Tuesday.
The man, described as an infiltrator who tried to cross the metal-and-sand barriers at the border, fired at the security officers when they approached him, the agency said. Security personnel tracked the man and he was killed in an exchange of fire, it added.
The turmoil in Yemen peaked Friday, when a mosque in Saleh's presidential compound was attacked. Yemen's state-run news agency SABA, citing a source in Saleh's office, reported last week that three guards and an imam were killed.
Western diplomats said the attack came from a bomb. Yemeni investigations are focusing on what happened inside the mosque, not a rocket or mortar attack, diplomats said Monday. One diplomat said the attack was not a suicide bombing and that the Yemeni investigation was ongoing.
The description of the attack as a bombing differs from what a Yemeni official told CNN last week. The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Saleh was in the mosque when two projectiles were fired during Friday prayers.
Supporters of Sadeq Al-Ahmar, leader of the Hashed tribe and an opponent of the Yemeni government, were suspected in the attack.
In response, Yemeni security forces shelled Al-Ahmar's home Friday, killing 10 people and wounding 35 others, according to Fawzi Al-Jaradi, an official with the Hashed tribal confederation.
After Saleh was taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment, the tribal leader and Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi -- Yemen's interim leader -- agreed on a cease-fire, said Abdulqawi Al-Qaisi, spokesman for the Hashed leader.
Yemen's largest opposition bloc has vowed to prevent Saleh from returning.
 The Yemeni people will do all in their power to not allow Saleh to re-enter the country, Joint Meeting Parties spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said Sunday.
A U.S. government official said Monday he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return. He said it was critical that the Saudis press Saleh to accept a Gulf Cooperation Council deal offering him immunity in exchange for stepping down.
Saudi state-run Ekhbariya television reported Monday that Saleh had undergone two operations in Saudi Arabia and would return to Yemen after he recovers.
A U.S. official told CNN Monday that the unrest makes U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen more difficult. 
 We rely on the Yemeni government as partners, the official said. The more the government is distracted by the political unrest, the more difficult it is for us. 
The Yemeni government has had a big impact on acquiring information on AQAP, the official said, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. If that information flow slows or stops, it inhibits our ability to gather information.

"The view from the visitors' centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is striking, to say the least. This is an ornithologist's dream: 200,000 hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western Europe. Dozens of Britain's most loved migratory birds, including house martins, swallows, cuckoos and warblers, rest here on their annual migrations from Africa. Donana, a UN World Heritage Site, is also home to some of Europe's rarest birds, including the Spanish imperial eagle, while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangered Iberian lynx. 
It is a glorious, vibrant landscape. Yet it exists on a knife-edge, a point illustrated dramatically in 1998 when almost two billion gallons of contaminated, highly acidic water, mixed with waste metals, poured into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at Los Frailes mine 45km to the north. A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river and over its banks, leaving a thick metallic crust over a vast stretch of parkland. More than 25,000 kilos of dead fish were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed. 
It was Spain's worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost EUR90m. Suddenly aware of Donana's status as the nation's most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further EUR360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape, which, in the 1950s and 60s, had been drained in places to create rice and cotton fields. Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state. 
It has been a costly but encouraging process. Yet the fate of Donana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. Plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through Donana, while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table. Silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that criss-cross Donana. 
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed Donana in 1998. ""This is Europe's most precious bird sanctuary, both in terms of indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of north-west Europe,"" says Laurence Rose of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). ""Donana already faces a great number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of its near-undoing 16 years ago. It is extremely worrying."" 
Having spent so much restoring Donana to its past glories, it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework Los Frailes. However, a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation. The crash of Spain's banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%. Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 precious jobs. 
""There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants,"" said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucia. ""We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area. This is a mining area. People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times, after all."" 
More to the point, added Fernandez, the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste, would be allowed. (It has also stipulated that the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes cannot bid for the contract. Sixteen years after the accident, the two sides remained locked over compensation claims.) ""The best technology in the world will be used here,"" Fernandez insisted. ""Liquid will not be used. We are going to insist on that. Our tender makes that clear."" 
The proposal has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition. One road sign I passed was liberally daubed with obscenities about the workers' union UGT, which supports the mine's reopening. For his part, Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the proposal. ""This is a very, very bad idea indeed,"" he told me. ""They say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain."" 
What alarms people such as Davila is the threat that a new mine poses to the intense investment in eco-tourism that has been made in Donana in recent years. An example is provided at the restaurant Dehesa de Abajo, where you can have a drink or a meal surrounded by trees in which storks and black kites are nesting. 
Virtually every visitor was equipped with a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars. There is a clear tourist trade to be made from the birdlife of Donana. Nor should this be surprising, for this is a truly special place. A vast hemisphere of sky hangs over this utterly flat but certainly not featureless landscape. Birds of every shape and size fill the air and sometimes the road. At one point on my visit, a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to fly off. 
""The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago. A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much, much more damaging impact,"" said Rose. This point is backed by Davila. ""After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it,"" he added. ""Now, we seem to be forgetting that lesson. It is very depressing.""

"A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average, while her brother will live to 78. They would have a longer life in Andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but are marginally better off than in the US (81 and 76), while if they lived in the Central African Republic, they would barely make it out of middle age (49 and 44). Nonetheless, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as Lesotho, which have been hit by HIV and violence, lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago. There has been a drop in deaths among under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010. 
That in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease. Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all - from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against HIV in Africa. 
The seven papers published by The Lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy. IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods. In the absence of death registries or medical records, they have been willing, for instance, to take evidence from verbal autopsies - deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. The most startling result has been the malaria figure, released earlier in 2012. IHME said 1.2 million die of the disease every year - twice as many as previously thought. The big increase is in adult deaths. Conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five. 
""The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,"" said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project. ""We originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical. African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot."" But, he adds, their fever could be something else. The findings have prompted further studies. 
Although Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, gave the IHME study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. ""We need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],"" said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster. ""We need to wait to be persuaded by evidence."" His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, added: ""People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO can't jump with any academic publication that states a different number."" However, said Mathers, ""the fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating"". One of the main themes, said Murray, was ""incredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be"". 
Reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the world's population in a decade, from 26 years old to almost 30. It has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. That is a 35-year increase in the mean age of death over four decades. ""In a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are ill-equipped to deal with it,"" Murray said. 
The second theme, entwined with it, is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed ""lifestyle"" diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer - some of which have significant genetic triggers. That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said. 
The third big finding was, Murray said, ""a surprise to us"". That was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives. ""The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,"" he said. They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain - complained of in every country in the world - anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. In addition, there was substance abuse. ""The rates for these are not going down over time,"" he said. ""We are making no progress in reducing these conditions.""

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Spain is officially clear of Ebola, the World Health Organization declared Tuesday, after no new cases were reported since a nurse's assistant who contracted the virus there tested negative for it.
Since then, 42 days have passed -- double the maximum known incubation period for the virus -- without another case, allowing Spain to be declared free of Ebola.
Spanish authorities had been monitoring 87 people who came into contact with healthcare worker Teresa Romero Ramos, 15 of whom were considered high-risk and were quarantined at a Madrid hospital, WHO said.
Another 145 hospital employees who helped care for Romero during her month-long stay at the Carlos III Hospital were also monitored.
The WHO statement said it commends Spain for the measures put in place to identify potential cases and prevent further transmission of the Ebola virus. 
Romero contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa. He died of the disease.

"Helen Keller was an American educator and journalist, who became one of the leading humanitarians in the history of the United States. Born on June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, a small town in Alabama, Keller was stricken with a childhood disease that left her deaf, and blind. The illness Keller suffered is a mystery to this day. She was diagnosed with ""Brain Fever,"" by her family doctor, but most people speculated that she suffered from either Scarlet Fever, or Meningitis. Unable to see, or hear, Keller became difficult to deal with as her behavior was described by her family and friends as wild.
 
Soon Keller and her family developed their own type of sign language that allowed them to communicate on a limited basis. Helen's mother sought help for her anguished child, which eventually led to Anne Sullivan, who was a recent graduate of the Perkins Institute for the Blind. The school had been successful in the past in educating blind students, and Sullivan was one of its star graduates. Once Sullivan and Keller got through the difficult beginnings, their friendship, and association lasted for 49 years.
Keller was determined to become educated, and to teach herself to communicate. After attending several schools, she became the first deaf and blind person to earn a college degree. She became very well-known, and began a lecture tour where she addressed social and political issues, including women's suffrage, and birth control.
In 1920, she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union, which is still active today. She addressed Congress to raise awareness to the plight of the blind. Through all her accomplishments, she fell into disfavor with the American public because of her socialist views later in her life. She died in her sleep just days before his 88th birthday, but she lives in the American consciousness for her tireless work, and perseverance.",C1
"A bipartisan group of women senators waded into the ongoing drama over the NFL, Ray Rice and domestic violence.
They sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calling on the football league to institute a real zero-tolerance policy in such cases.
The 16 signatories wrote that they were shocked and disgusted by the in-elevator video that surfaced of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee in an elevator, and they pointed to the allegation that the NFL had possession of the video, which became public Monday, when it handed down its original lenient two-game suspension.
 The NFL's current policy sends a terrible message to players, fans and all Americans that even after committing a horrific act of violence, you can quickly be back on the field, the senators wrote.
The NFL recently changed its domestic violence punishment to a minimum suspension of six games for a first offense and a lifetime time ban for a second offense.
 If you violently assault a woman, you should n't get a second chance to play football in the NFL, the senators wrote.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, recently told CNN that he would not rule out congressional action to force the NFL's hand on domestic abuse.

Given the show's penchant for incredibly nuanced observations of hipster culture -- municipal recycling guidelines are enough fodder for an entire sketch -- it should come as no surprise that Brownstein was equally committed to detail when it came to decorating the 1912 bungalow she bought in the trendy Grant Park neighborhood 10 years ago after touring extensively.

Brownstein filled the place with sentimental, one-of-a-kind finds: A taxidermied weasel once owned by Amy Sedaris sits on the mantel; '50s - era coastal landscapes by various local artists fill the walls; and a record collectiona $ which, in Brownstein's case, is several thousand vinyls strong and meticulously alphabetized by artista $ testifies that yes, this is a hipster home.

All in all, the spread is not unlike the one Carrie's Portlandia alter ego inhabits. Hard-core fans may recognize Brownstein's real-life mutts from the now infamous episode about dog parks. Armisen, whom she met in 2003 at a Saturday Night Live after-party, is clearly her partner in crime in real life, too: The comedian, who rents a house nearby during filming, texts Brownstein in the middle of her ELLE shoot to let her know that Lou Reed has died. -LRB- A fellow musician, Armisen is also a frequent guest in Brownstein's basement -- a soundproof practice space tricked out with a loungy Chesterfield sofa and no fewer than five guitars. -RRB-

Of course, inhabiting the blurred line between reality and fiction can have its downsides. A particular source of consternation for Brownstein is one of the show's most famous skits -- Put a Bird on It -- which depicts an artisan couple with a compulsive knack for putting a cutesy bird on virtually everything they make.
 Now I go into stores and see things I want to buy with birds on it, and I ca n't, because I 'm too self-conscious, Brownstein says. The other day, I was in a store and saw a cute dress with birds on it and I was like, No, I just ca n't.

"Evangelical leaders are taking a step back from their decades-long fight against gay marriage, softening their tone and recalibrating their goals.
In recent interviews with about a half-dozen prominent evangelicals, no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority. The leaders said they 're more focused on protecting religious liberties as same-sex marriage becomes legal in a growing number of states.
 Is it time to differentiate between religious ceremony and civil ceremony ? Jim Daly, the president of Focus on the Family, said in an interview with CNN. Civil ceremony to the Christian community is no different than getting your car registered. 
The shifting attitude comes as the Supreme Court could take up gay marriage as early as next year. Meanwhile, Republicans, who will take full control of Congress in January, are largely ignoring the issue -- just like most of the leading potential GOP contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination.
 There is a recognition that while the fight should not be given up on upholding the several thousand-year-old definition of marriage, the courts are probably very quickly going to undo that, said Erick Erickson, a conservative pundit and editor of RedState.com. Behind the scenes, a lot of evangelical leaders inside and outside of politics are laying the groundwork for religious liberty and conscience protections. 
Implications for GOP
The new stance could have big implications for Republicans heading into the 2016 presidential election. Evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community eases its opposition to same-sex marriage, that could make it easier for candidates to do the same. The party is under pressure to expand its appeal to young people and minorities and an openness to gay marriage could help that effort.
Hambycast: Rand Paul's campus challenge
Of course, there's still plenty of opposition to same-sex marriage among Republicans. And the issue is a big fundraising motivator for the party and its allies.
Vincent Harris, a 26-year-old digital strategist who's worked for evangelical favorites like Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee said social issues including gay marriage remain very potent to the Republican electorate. 
` Joke notion '
Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, dismissed talk of an evangelical shift as a joke notion. 
 People are still charged up about this, Brown said. There's not been enough standing up for marriage especially in the wake of what is essentially a constitutional crisis. 
Daly, whose daily Focus on the Family radio broadcast reach more than 2.9 million listeners weekly, is nowhere close to endorsing same-sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the U.S. is n't a fait accompli. But his vision for the evangelical movement is focused on reaching out to, rather than attacking or rejecting, other segments of society -- what he calls taking a gracious attitude. 
He frequently mentioned his friends in the gay rights community. 
One of those friends is Ted Trimpa, a prominent gay activist and Democratic strategist. The two struck up an unlikely friendship after Daly reached out to Trimpa's office about two years ago to team up and fight child trafficking in their home state of Colorado.
They see their bond as an example of where the dialogue is heading, through Trimpa said people faint when they see us together. 
` Common ground '
 With Jim, it's a new day, Trimpa said. The reality of it is gays are n't going away and evangelicals are n't going away so we 're figuring out common ground. 
Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, is also advocating for a more open approach and has called for Christians to love your gay and lesbian neighbors. 
 If we do n't recognize -LRB- the culture shift -RRB-, we 're clueless as to what is happening, Moore said in an interview.
How Supreme Court's non-decision helps gay marriage
Matthew Vines, meanwhile, is an openly gay evangelical who recently published a book attempting to debunk Biblical interpretations that define homosexuality as a sin. He went to a conference sponsored by Moore's group in October and was surprised that even his staunchest critics constructively interacted with him. He said he would have been completely ignored at the convention five years ago.
 There's definitely a coming divide between evangelicals, but it's not public yet, Vines said. Over the next year in particular, people will start to show their true colors. 
Generational divide
About 43 % of white evangelical millennials support same-sex marriage, according to a 2014 Public Religion Research Institute poll, while 7 in 10 white evangelicals overall oppose same-sex marriage. The generational split is even more pronounced among the GOP: nearly two-thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39 % of all Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center survey.
GOP leaders are eyeing those polls closely and in the last two years, four Republican senators have announced their support for same-sex marriage. This year, the GOP fielded two openly gay Republican candidates for Congress -- though neither won.
Some, like Republican strategist and LGBT activist Margaret Hoover, say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest.
 I think the fact that the majority of Republicans do n't support same sex marriage or LGBT freedom is detrimental to reaching out and connecting to a new generation of voters, said Hoover, who is also a CNN political commentator.
Hoover runs the American Unity PAC, which spent more than $4 million in the 2014 cycle to support pro-gay marriage and LGBT rights Republican candidates, according to the group's pre-election Federal Elections Commission filing.
The GOP could see at least one pro-gay marriage presidential candidate in the 2016 elections if Sen. Rob Portman -- who has a gay son and endorsed same-sex marriage in 2013 -- decides to seek the party's nomination.
 When Mitt Romney was the nominee of the party, could you have imagined that there could be a Republican nominee the next time around who is in favor of same-sex marriage ? Even I could n't have imagined that, Hoover said.

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- After days of turmoil, Yemen's President, Prime Minister and Cabinet have stood down, leaving the troubled Middle Eastern nation without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict.
President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's resignation Thursday came after Houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff, seized control of key government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out Wednesday.
The chaos in Yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders.
For the United States and its allies, Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo.
For the moment, uncertainty rules. Beyond it yawns the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian rift that terror groups such as AQAP could exploit.
Meda Al Rowas, a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, told CNN that unless Hadi is reinstated, the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim.
 Our forecast is really civil war in Yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas, she said.
Who is in charge right now really depends on where in Yemen you are, she said.
The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- have taken control of Sanaa and the northern provinces of Amran and Sadaa.
But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.
 This really creates a situation where even if the Houthis keep control over Sanaa, they have little chance of taking control of the whole country, said Al Rowas. We expect to see armed resistance. 
It's possible that Hadi, himself a southerner, could rescind his resignation and put a Gulf Cooperation Council initiative for a negotiated transition of power back on track.
But that seems unlikely at present.
According to the national news agency SABA, Yemen's Parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session Sunday, called by Parliament Speaker Yahya al-Rai.
Analysts suggest that because there's no vice president, the speaker could be next in the line of succession, taking on the role of acting president. He's close to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who clung to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago.
Despite their takeover of Sanaa, it's unclear whether the Houthis really want to take charge of the country.
The group more likely wanted Hadi to remain in power as a figurehead behind whom they could pull the strings, without having to take on the burdensome business of governance, said Al Rowas.
Under Wednesday's failed peace deal, the Hadi government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the Houthis more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the President's kidnapped aide.
The government only finally got parliamentary approval in December, said U.S.-based Yemen analyst Sama'a Al-Hamdani. Hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he wo n't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the Houthi takeover, she said.
The Houthis are Shiites from northern Yemen who make up about 30 % of the population. They 've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the Sunni AQAP.
At the beginning of 2014, they won a series of battles close to the Saudi border. And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended on Sanaa, where they took over government buildings, the main airport and a share of power. In the past week, they 've taken it to another level.
Although they have been fighting AQAP, they are no friend to the United States. One of the main slogans of this historically Iranian-backed group is Death to America. 
The Houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former President Saleh, said Al Rowas.
This facilitated the Houthissouthward expansion, but the alliance is fragile, she said, not least because Saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the Houthis.
Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate AQAP is perhaps the best-known group internationally.
It first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2002, but thanks to the efforts of Saudi authorities was a mostly a spent force by 2005, according to analysis from Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism. It re-emerged, reinvigorated, in Yemen in 2009 after the Saudi outfit merged with a Yemeni al Qaeda counterpart.
Besides battling the Yemeni government and Houthis, it has been involved in international terror attacks, including the failed 2009 attempt to bring down an airliner over Detroit.
The Muslim Brotherhood is also a powerful group in Yemen -- in the shape of the Al Islah Party -- and is well represented in the transitional government. It loathes the Houthis and has its own militias.
The fighting in Yemen also provides an opening to ISIS, which is keen to outflank al Qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith. In November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on Yemeni Sunnis to resist the Houthis.
There are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories.
While in power, Hadi and the government of Prime Minister Khaled Bahah have been trying to fight AQAP on the ground and also have authorized U.S. drone strikes in the country against terror targets.
As part of those efforts, the United States has several hundred American diplomats and military personnel in Yemen. But the U.S. Embassy has been on reduced staffing since September.
The Houthis have publicly said they oppose U.S. drone strikes and U.S. involvement in Yemen.
There are currently no talks with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, according to U.S. officials. Multiple policy options are being considered, the officials said, though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed.
 The safety and security of U.S. personnel is our top priority in Yemen, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. We are evaluating the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis. We call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community, including our personnel. 
Al-Hamdani, the Yemen analyst, said she did n't see an immediate need to pull U.S. personnel out of Yemen.
 I think Yemen is safe at the time being, she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Houthis have been in charge for a while. They have popular committees all over the capital of Sanaa, and they 've been running the security show.
 I do, however, want to say that the Americans might need to start talking to the Houthis. And if the Americans are talking to Iran in back channels, they need to do the same with the Houthis. 
Since Hadi's resignation, there has been a lot of anger against the Houthis in parts of the country, said Al Rowas, the IHS Country Risk analyst.
While Hadi was n't able to unify the country while in power, she said, since the Houthi takeover of Sanaa, he has become the popular symbol of anti-Houthi sentiment across southern and central Yemen.
Many there are calling for his return, she said.
A chief flashpoint for popular anger may be the central Marib province, she said. There have already been some low-level confrontations, and tribes are mobilizing in the area.
Large-scale protests have also been seen in Aden, the main seaport in the country's south, where the current chaos plays into the hands of the secession movement.

"The gruesome images are clear. There's little doubt Syrians suffered a chemical attack last month.
But videos of the aftermath -- including 13 shown to Congress -- do nothing to show who was responsible.
President Barack Obama says he has high confidence that the regime is to blame -- the strongest position short of confirmation. But his administration has not released hard evidence.
Secretary of State John Kerry says declassifying any more information could endanger sources and methods of U.S. intelligence gathering.
Britain, France and NATO also blame Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the horror in a Damascus suburb last month.
Still, as Obama engages in a full-court press to build U.S. support for strikes, some Americans hear echoes of a different basketball analogy: slam dunk. 
That's how then-CIA Director George Tenet described what turned out to be flawed intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the war 10 years ago.
Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel were senators at the time.
 We are especially sensitive, Chuck and I, to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence. And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and re-scrubbed the evidence, Kerry told Congress.
Some lawmakers remain skeptical.
 The administration is asking us to go to war on the basis of a four-page document and a 12-page document and none of the underlying evidence, Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, complained on CNN's New Day Saturday.
 They have evidence showing the regime has probably the responsibility for the attacks. They have n't linked it directly to Assad, in my estimation, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, told CNN's State of the Union Sunday.
Beyond a reasonable doubt or no ? U.S. says both
White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said the intelligence passes a common sense test. 
 Now, do we have a picture or do we have irrefutable, beyond a reasonable doubt evidence ? This is not a court of law. And intelligence does not work that way, he told CNN's State of the Union.
But Kerry said last week, We can tell you beyond any reasonable doubt that our evidence proves the Assad regime prepared for this attack, issued instructions to prepare for this attack, warned its own forces to use gas masks. 
Kerry says the amount of information that's been declassified is unprecedented. 
That information boils down to summaries of what the evidence is.
` Concreteevidence: Described, not declassified
Physical, concrete evidence shows where the rockets came from, when they were fired, and that not one landed in regime-controlled territory, Kerry said.
 Satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred, a declassified White House report says. ... The lack of flight activity or missile launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack. 
The White House released a map, but no satellite images.
The report also cites multiple streams of intelligence, without giving specifics.
` Intercepted communications '
 In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack, the U.S. report says.
 Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of Adra... near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On August 21, a Syrian regime element prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the utilization of gas masks. 
 We have a body of information, including past Syrian practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack, the report says. ... We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence. 
Intelligence shows Syrian chemical weapons personnel were told to cease operations in the afternoon of August 21 and that the regime then intensified the artillery barrage in the area, the report says.
The material remains classified.
U.S.: Opposition does n't have the capacity '
U.S., British, and French intelligence reports all agree that the opposition could n't have pulled off such an attack.
 We are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale, particularly from the heart of regime territory, Kerry told lawmakers.
The White House report points to Syria's known stockpiles of chemical agents. And it says the United States assesses with high confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year, including in the Damascus suburbs. This assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of Syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin.
 We assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons. 
In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicions that Syrian rebel forces had used sarin gas. But the findings were not conclusive, the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria said at the time, and the opposition Syrian Coalition condemned any use of chemical weapons. The U.S. State Department said at the time it had no evidence suggesting rebels had used chemical weapons.
Russia, a Syrian ally, says its investigation of a March attack in Aleppo, which apparently involved chemical weaopns, found that the charge used was homemade and similar to projectiles produced by the group Bashaar al-Nasr, part of the opposition Syrian Islamic Liberation Front. Sarin was discovered in samples from the scene, the foreign ministry said.
Assad's motive unclear
Some experts on the region question why al-Assad would have ordered the attack.
 Al Assad has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage, and in this phase of the conflict. He is not losing, writes Ed Husain of the Council on Foreign Relations in a CNN Opinion column. He pointed out that some suggest the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front or other opposition elements may have carried out the attack to bait America into the conflict.
William Polk, who served U.S. administrations during the Cuban Missile Crisis and and 1967 Middle East War, writes in The Atlantic, I do not see what Assad could have gained from this gas attack. 
Analyst: No way in hellU.S. can back up death toll
Questions about the purported death toll in last month's attack also raises questions about the solidity of the information the U.S. is using.
A preliminary assessment determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children, the U.S. report says.
 Secretary Kerry seems to have been sandbagged into using an absurdly over-precise number, says Anthony Cordesman, former director of intelligence assessment at the U.S. Defense Department.
Now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Cordesman writes on the CSIS website, Put simply, there is no way in hell the U.S. intelligence community could credibly have made an estimate this exact. 
The methodology used to come up with the toll remains classified.
Rebel leaders have said more than 1,300 people were killed. Britain's Joint Intelligence Organization says at least 350 people were killed. A French report says several sources estimated at least 355 deaths, while others estimate 1,500.
U.N. wo n't place blame
The United Nations is calling on world leaders not to take action until the results of the U.N. probe are in. But it's unclear how soon that may be.
And the U.N. team's mandate was only to determine whether chemical weapons were used -- not by whom.
And Obama says that cat's out of the bag.
 Frankly, nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used, he said.
So, short of a shocking finding that chemical weapons were not used, it's unclear how much of an effect the U.N. results will ultimately have.
Meanwhile, the Syrian regime continues to insist rebels were behind any chemical attack. But it offers no proof to back that up.
After word broke Sunday that al-Assad had done an interview with Charlie Rose of CBS and PBS denying any involvement in chemical weaopns attacks, Kerry was asked for a response.
 The evidence speaks for itself, he said.

"Former hostage Sigifredo Lopez landed in the Colombian city of Palmira to a hero's welcome Thursday afternoon, free after nearly seven years of captivity by Marxist rebels in the jungle.
A Brazilian helicopter takes off Thursday from an airport in Palmira, Colombia, to pick up Sigifredo Lopez.
Lopez was met at the helicopter that ferried him to freedom by his wife and two sons, who cried openly and deeply as they hugged him. One son held his father's head in his hands and spoke to him fervently as he kissed his forehead.
Lopez's mother also hugged him before the freed hostage was swallowed by a mob of family members of other hostages who had died in captivity.
After hugging well-wishers for more than 20 minutes, Lopez climbed into a white Red Cross sport utility vehicle and drove off in a four-vehicle convoy.
The former regional legislator was abducted April 11, 2002, by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC.
Lopez's release was the sixth unilateral one by the rebels in a week, but few of the kidnappings were as dramatic as the one in which Lopez and 11 other lawmakers were taken.
He is the only one of that group who remains alive.
A video taken by the FARC that day in April 2002 and released in late 2006 shows the first minutes of the bold kidnapping that led to his captivity.
The rebels had been training for months. At a FARC camp, they practiced in Colombian army and police uniforms and made mock-ups of the regional parliament in Cali with plastic tarps and sticks.
A rebel camera was rolling as the 20-strong commando group drove a bus to Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. Salsa music was blaring. Watch the FARC footage of the dramatic abduction of Lopez and other lawmakers 
They were posing as government soldiers. Motorcycle outriders cleared the way.
Once they reached the parliament building, they faked a bomb alert.
The bus pulled out in front of the building, and the video shows people running from the perceived threat.
On the video, an unseen rebel is heard to say, For the deputies, we have a special vehicle. 
Twelve congressmen took their seats, believing the military was shepherding them to safety. Minutes passed, and one politician asked where they are headed.
A few minutes later, the muffled reply can be heard: Ladies and gentlemen. We are the FARC. 
Back in the mountains, the hostages were herded aboard a truck. Guerrillas waved and hugged as they celebrated their audacious mission.
In 2003, Lopez and some of the other hostages appeared in a proof-of-life video. One of his colleagues simply wrote, Until when ? on his hand and held it up to camera.
Another, Jairo Hoyos, sent a prophetic plea to the president: Mister President. Those who are about to die salute you. 
Eleven of the congressmen were killed in captivity in June 2007. The FARC said they died in cross-fire during a military rescue mission. The Colombian army rejects that assertion.
When the bodies were recovered three months later, autopsies showed most had been shot multiple times in the back.
Lopez was the sole survivor. On Thursday night, he may be able to tell the rest of the world what happened that day.
FARC has released five other hostages in the past week. On Tuesday, Alan Jara, the former governor of Colombia's Meta state, arrived at the airport in Villavicencio, southeast of Bogota.
Four hostages -- three police officers and a soldier -- were released over the weekend.
Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba has brokered the releases with the help of the the International Committee of the Red Cross and a group called Colombians for Peace. Brazil also has helped, providing the aircraft used in the releases.
The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, announced the releases December 21 and designated Cordoba as the coordinator. Some analysts see these releases as a first step toward an eventual peace accord. Others suggest this is just another sign that government military gains combined with a tough right-wing political line are gradually beating the FARC into submission.
Colombia has said the rebels are still holding about 700 captives
The government recently has offered rewards to guerrillas who surrender and free hostages. Last month, two guerrillas fled their camp deep in the jungles of southern Colombia, bringing along two captives, a 14-year-old boy and a male adult who were kidnapped in December.
And a July rescue operation freed former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who had been held captive since 2002, along with three American military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members.
The government has said the FARC's military force has been severely compromised in recent months, but authorities still accuse it of trafficking huge quantities of cocaine to finance its decades-old insurgency.
Security analysts said FARC, established in the early 1960s, has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas.
The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, analysts say.

"Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head.
Dr. Othman el-Zentani would not disclose whether findings revealed if Gadhafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close-range -- a key question that has prompted the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life.
Doctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said. Autopsies were also conducted on the bodies of Gadhafi's son, Mutassim, and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis.
No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.
The autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said.
Meanwhile, the three bodies would likely return to a cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said.
Long lines of people turned up all weekend long to view the corpses.
Gadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites, a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported.
Gadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the National Transitional Council, which marked the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started.
But uncertainty was still swirling Sunday about the death of the Libyan leader, who Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes.
Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
But others have questioned that account.
Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a humiliating end for the former dictator.
 When he left the area, he was very much alive, Bouckaert said. There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice. 
An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi. CNN could not independently verify that claim.
The video, purportedly recorded near an ambulance carrying Gadhafi's body, shows a jubilant group of fighters pouring water on a man's head.
 He is the one who killed him, one man says, pointing.
 He killed him in front of me, I swear to God, another man chimes in.
A lawyer for Gadhafi's son Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement Sunday saying, Saadi Gadhafi is shocked and outraged by the vicious brutality which accompanied the murders of his father and brother. 
 The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them, the statement said.
Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.
The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death.
The United States supports those investigation requests, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN's State of the Union Sunday.
 As Libyans move into the future once again, they need to do so with a sense of unity and reconciliation. They need to hold each other accountable. Those who do not have blood on their hands must be made to feel safe and included, regardless of whether or not they supported Gadhafi in the past, she said. So we believe in the rule of law, and accountability, and such an investigation would contribute to that. 
U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday that there were at least two cell-phone videos, one showing -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- alive and one showing him dead. 
 Taken together, these videos are very disturbing, he said.
 We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declined to hear an emergency application for a stay filed by a Florida deep-sea salvage company that wanted to maintain possession of a half billion dollars worth of gold and silver coins until a final decision is made about who owns them.
 Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington, said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure. I am pleased and proud for all of us. 
Odyssey Marine Exploration had made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court's order last week that it turn over the treasure to Spain.
Justice Clarence Thomas, who has jurisdiction over applications from Florida, denied without comment the motion in Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. v. Kingdom of Spain.
The company has filed at least one another stay request with the justices.
Melinda MacConnel, Odyssey's vice president and general counsel, expressed disappointment, but said she recognized that the court rarely grants such motions. How we proceed from here will depend on whether a mandate issues and what a subsequent order might look like, especially given the fact that the courts have determined they do not have jurisdiction in the case, she said in a statement.
Goold said it was unlikely that the Supreme Court would review the case. The Supreme Court accepts 1 % or less of such requests and today's decision makes a strong statement about their chances, he said.
The dispute goes back to 2007, when Odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the United States.
Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure.
Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet.
In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court.
In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last week, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court.
The appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said last week.
Spain believes that most of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in Florida, Goold said.
Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, told CNN in Madrid on Wednesday that the case was never really about the money.
 We 're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such, Wert said in an interview.
He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere.
Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony.
 Formally, they have n't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums, Wert said.
The treasure includes fabled pieces of eight, some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said.

"Benjamin Carle is 96.9% made in France, right down to his underpants and socks. Unfortunately, six Ikea forks, a Chinese guitar and unsourced wall paint stopped him being declared a 100% economic patriot, but nobody is perfect. 
Carle, 26, set out, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary. 
The idea was triggered by the Minister for Economic Renewal Arnaud Montebourg's call for the public to buy French to save the country's industrial production sector. 
The experiment cost Carle his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his spectacles (Italian); his underpants (Moroccan); morning coffee (Guatemalan) and his adored David Bowie music (British). 
Fortunately, his long-suffering girlfriend, Anais, and cat, Loon, (both French) stuck with him. 
""Politicians say all sorts of things and expect us to go along with it. I wanted to see if it was possible and feasible to do what the minister was asking us to do; to hold him to account for his words,"" Carle told the Guardian over a non-French coffee in a Parisian cafe after finishing his documentary. 
He set just three rules: eat only foods produced in France, eliminate contact with foreign-made goods and do so on EUR1,800 a month (above the minimum wage of EUR1,430 to cover the extra expense of living in Paris). 
The journalist was shocked to find out at the start of the experiment that only 4.5% of the contents of his flat were made nationally - and that the rest would have to go, including the lightbulbs (China) and green beans (Kenya). 
The removal men left his home almost bare. 
Left without a refrigerator (none are made in France) or nail clippers, he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge and saw at his toenails with a penknife. 
His foreign-made clothes, down to his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: French-produced underpants (EUR26), socks (EUR9), polo shirt (EUR75), espadrille sandals ( EUR26), but no jeans as none are produced in France. 
During the experiment, Carle scoured supermarket shelves for 100% French-made products, learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France, proudly brushed his teeth with the last toothbrush made in France by a company in Picardie employing 29 people and hand-washed his smalls until he found the last French-made washing machine (which, being top opening, would not fit under the kitchen counter). 
Going out with friends was problematic - no American films, no Belgian beer, no sushi or pizza. Staying home, with no sofa for the first few months and no television, meant listening to crooner Michel Sardou and reading French novels. French wine was, of course, allowed and French-Canadian singer Celine Dion, but not, according to his advisers, French bands such as Daft Punk, who sing in English. 
Unable to use his British-made bicycle or even a French car after discovering the only affordable Peugeot, Renault and Citroen models are mostly made overseas, he invested in a fug-emitting orange Mobylette moped. 
The last things to go were the computer, replaced by a Qooq, a recipe tablet that connects - slowly - to the internet and the iPhone, swapped for an old Sagem mobile. 
The documentary shows Carle - realizing he is addicted to his iPhone - smashing it with a brand-new French-made Tefal saucepan, while his girlfriend shrieks: ""Are you crazy? Those are new pans!"" 
Carle tells viewers his aim is to ""save the French economy. After all, I like Mission Impossible"". He admits the experiment was part serious and part jest. At one point, he consults a French language expert to check if he should be using ""cool"" and other Anglicisms - he was advised to swap it for the nearest French equivalent: ""chouette"". 
On discovering France makes no refrigerators (apart from wine coolers) or televisions, but is big in aeroplane seats and windmills, he sighs and says: ""Great. Nothing that will fit into my apartment."" 
At the end of the experiment, Carle takes out a bank loan to refurnish his home and clothe himself. A special ""auditor"" declares him 96.9% ""made in France"" and Montebourg visits to present him with a medal. 
Carle's conclusion: ""It's not entirely possible or even desirable to live 100% made in France, particularly in terms of new technology. But that wasn't the point. 
""This wasn't about French nationalism or patriotism. It was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we consume and make different choices, and that applies in all countries. If we want to save jobs and industries, wherever we are, we might think about supporting them. 
""A T-shirt is more expensive in France but I can be sure it has been produced by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions. I cannot be sure about a cheaper T-shirt produced in Asia or Morocco."" 
He added: ""It's hypocrisy to go around blaming capitalists for a country's economic decline when people could be doing more as consumers."" 
Carle says he hopes to continue supporting French industry and producers, but not 100%. ""It is a full-time job just finding the stuff,"" he said. 
The first thing he did when the experiment ended was invite his friends around for the evening to enjoy ""a plate of cheese and listen to the David Bowie album Aladdin Sane"". 
""It was difficult not being able to invite people around because there was nowhere to sit ... but I'd choose the Bowie over a sofa any day.""  ",C1
"Recently, investors celebrated the birthday of the current bull market, which turned five years old. On this anniversary, it's worth reflecting on how valuations, particularly of technology companies, are being calculated.
On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Airbnb, a travel rental company, which has not released information about its revenue or profitability, may be approaching a valuation of $10 billion. Other startups in the IPO pipeline include a number of unprofitable companies like Box and Square, with rumored valuations in the billions.
Have billion-dollar or multibillion-dollar valuations become the norm ? Is it all about hype and greed nowadays ? Whatever happened to the wisdom of investors like Warren Buffet who evaluated companies based on their profits and fundamental performances ?
The value of any company is a function of the cash flow it will generate in the future. A healthy cash flow allows a company to repay its shareholders and initial investors who, understandably, expect their investment to be eventually reimbursed.
Ordinary investors who rely on the hype surrounding a company rather than the company's fundamentals may make decisions that they regret later on. Just ask anyone who invested in the Pets.com IPO about the danger of falling for overvalued companies.
Granted, everyone in the tech industry -- from startup founders to venture capitalists -- is eager to find and bet on the next big thing. Still, the money being thrown around is mind-boggling.
Even a decent business model and the potential for growth do not justify a multibillion-dollar valuation. Yet, Facebook recently offered an astounding $19 billion to buy WhatsApp, a popular messaging service. Though WhatsApp has reportedly been able to turn a small profit, this overblown acquisition price is higher than the market cap of 275 companies in the S&P 500.
Some market watchers have argued, as Michael Wolf did on CNN.com, that the WhatsApp acquisition is indicative of a fundamental shift, and that traditional old world methods of determining valuation have been replaced by new world metrics.
For example, Wolf cited Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp at $42 per user, which is in line with price-per-user acquisitions of companies like YouTube, Tumblr and Instagram. This is one way of looking at things, but it's severely flawed.
The value of a customer is in the revenue the customer provides, not in his or her mere existence.
If we look at the price-per-user metric without evaluating revenue per customer, the analysis becomes eerily similar to the late 1990s, during the dotcom boom when, for example, number of eyeballs was a metric used to evaluate technology companies.
Counting eyeballs or user base or potential only works in a bull market when market momentum can make poor decisions seem wise. Perhaps we remember the NASDAQ's high of 5048.62, during the height of the tech boom, and not when it fell to 1114.11 in 2002 when the tech bubble burst.
But bull markets do not last forever, and it's important to make sure we 're evaluating companies based on their long-term value, regardless of market cycle.
Of course, not all overvalued companies are bad companies. Twitter, for example, has a sizable user base, solid revenue growth and an undeniably disruptive and innovative technology. It's safe to say that Twitter has a lot of potential. However, the company's valuation is simply not justified by its fundamental performance. Twitter's stock is trading at nearly 45 times its 2013 revenue, and its profit multiple -LRB- a company's market value expressed in terms of its earnings -RRB- is nonexistent, given that it has yet to establish a profitable business model.
Sure, there are some companies, like Amazon, that do n't meet traditional metrics of financial strength that end up performing incredibly well in the stock market. But they are the exception, not the rule.
Consider the example of Vonage, one of the hottest IPOs of 2006. Despite losing 97 cents of every dollar in sales, the company had a $2.6 billion valuation. The company's fundamentals did not match its valuation. The results speak for themselves, with Vonage shares currently trading at $4.53, down from their $17.00 IPO price.
We are forced to accede to the most logical and rational valuation methods; otherwise, there is no structure to making investment decisions. For every Amazon, there are several Vonages.
Despite what some market watchers say, the old world method of valuing companies is still the best way of valuing companies.
I suppose it's true that Christopher Columbus made a great discovery by sailing the wrong way around the earth trying to find India. Here is a case where somebody happened upon great success based on incorrect data and methods. However, investors placing their bets on tech companies without basic fundamentals are more likely to resemble Ponce de Leon: map-less and looking hopelessly for the Fountain of Youth.

"In 2012, photographer Matika Wilbur sold everything in her Seattle apartment and hit the road on a cross-country journey.
Her goal ? To photograph individuals from each of the 562 federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States and memorialize their stories.
Since then, the number of federally recognized tribes has risen to 566, and Wilbur is still crisscrossing the country, immersing herself in the worlds of Native Americans from Brooklyn to the far reaches of Alaska for her ongoing photo series, Project 562.
 Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress, said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series. -LRB- Project 562 -RRB- gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans. 
A selection of photos from Project 562 is on display at the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington through October 5, with audio from Wilbur's conversations with her subjects.
Fans of the series say its timing could not be better. With mainstream America showing more support for efforts to end appropriation of Native American imagery in sports and fashion, they say Project 562 provides positive examples to fill the void.
 Having these counter-narratives and counter-representations to the stereotypes and negative portrayals we see in the media every day is really important for helping people understand contemporary Native Americans, said Keene.
The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
 What she's doing is not just photographing. She's building relationships and bonds that are going to last far beyond the physical photographs. 
Native American designers fight cultural caricatures
` The project is for the people '
Wilbur, whose first name means the messenger, said the images allow Americans to see a diverse representation of a group they rarely see and hear from. They also highlight positive role models in Indian country for the next generation.
 The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone, Wilbur said. I think that there are truths that remain untold and we can really learn a lot from one another. Hopefully it can inspire the next generation to seek that authenticity. 
Questions around Native American identity are central to Project 562. Wilbur asks each person 15 questions about their family history, self-determination, sovereignty and the future. Then she asks her subjects how and where they would like to be photographed and takes their portrait. Some wear traditional regalia and pose in sites relevant to their tribe's history. Others stand on their porches in T-shirts and jeans, or on the roofs of buildings. Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
Participating in Project 562 was an opportunity for Keene to reflect on what being a contemporary Native American meant to her.
Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans. Keene, a Harvard-educated post-doctoral researcher at Brown University focusing on Native access to higher education, deconstructs stereotypes of Native Americans on her blog, Native Appropriations. Like Keene, Wilbur left Indian country to pursue higher education and spent part of her career in fashion photography before turning her camera on indigenous communities in South America and the United States.
Taking Native American fashion Beyond Buckskin '
The two met in Keene's apartment in downtown Phoenix in January, when Keene was writing her dissertation as a predoctoral fellow at Arizona State University. Keene told Wilbur about how her Cherokee ancestors were forced from their ancestral lands in western North Carolina to Oklahoma. They lived in Oklahoma until they were displaced by the construction of a river.
It was not until Keene was working on her dissertation at Harvard that she visited her ancestral land in North Carolina for the first time. She said it was a powerful experience she 'll never forget.
 We talked about how to me, being a real Cherokee means I can go to those places and feel a connection with the land and know my ancestors stood there thousands of years ago, she said. This is something that runs through me, and that connection makes me a real Cherokee person, being able to say that with full authority and full knowledge. I had n't felt it until I was there. 
Creating a legacy for Native youth
The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said. Some Native Americans lost their language and traditions through assimilation in American Indian boarding schools. Others are fighting for federal recognition of their tribes under the vast regulatory criteria of the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. The project has prompted her to ponder what being a Native American will mean for future generations.
Code talker Chester Nez and the tragic history of native language
 I 've recently come to recognize that it really is about the actions, the way we choose to live our lives on a daily basis, is -LRB- what's -RRB- really going to control the outcome of what happens to our people, Wilbur explained.
She has high hopes for Project 562's legacy. This year, a second Kickstarter campaign surpassed her $54,000 goal, to raise more than $213,000. She's using the money to continue traveling and plan the next iteration of Project 562 as books, websites, maybe even educational materials.
 The life we live is for the people, Wilbur said. That's what I was raised for, to find my gift and share it with the community.

"Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered clay pots containing her few houseplants. When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below. ""I didn't understand what was going on,"" said Zaglumyonova. ""There was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions. My first thought was that it was a plane crash."" 
What she had actually witnessed were the death throes of a ten-tonne meteorite that plunged to Earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise. Officials put the number of people injured at almost 1,200, with more than 40 taken to hospital - most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorite's descent. There were no reported deaths. 
The meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into chunks between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk, a city of more than one million people to the south of Russia's Ural mountains, as mobile phone networks swiftly became jammed by the volume of calls. Amateur video footage from the area, often peppered with the obscene language of frightened observers, showed the chunks of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact. 
The vapour trail was visible for hundreds of miles around, including in neighbouring Kazakhstan. Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite struck. ""First we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of some unspecified smoke in the sky,"" she said. Then, after a few minutes, came the explosions. At least three craters were subsequently discovered, according to the Ministry of the Interior, and were being monitored by the military. One crater was more than six metres wide, while another lump of meteorite was reported to have slammed through the thick ice of a nearby lake. Radiation levels at the impact sites were normal, according to local military officials. 
In Chelyabinsk itself, schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early. About 200 children were among the injured. 
A steady stream of lightly injured people, most suffering cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where Bets works. She said a nearby dormitory building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in suffering from fright. ""There were a lot of girls in shock. Some were very pale and many of them fainted,"" she said. 
Early estimates suggested more than 100,000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings hit. The total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at in excess of one billion roubles (GBP20m). 
The meteorite over Chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before asteroid 2012 DA14 was expected to make the closest pass to Earth (about 17,510 miles) of any recorded cosmic body. But experts said the two events were linked by nothing more than coincidence. 
Rumours and conspiracy theories, however, swirled in the first few hours after the incident. Reports on Russian state television and in local media suggested that the meteorite was engaged by local air defence units and blown apart at an altitude of more than 15 miles. 
The ultranationalist leader of Russia's Liberal Democrat party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but military action by the United States, echoing much of the speculation voiced on amateur film footage. ""It's not a meteorite falling - it's a test of new American weapons,"" Zhirinovsky said. 
Some were quick to take advantage of the confusion. Enterprising people were offering lumps of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact. 
President Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, were informed about the incident, and Putin convened a meeting with the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry. ""It's proof that not only are economies vulnerable but the whole planet,"" Medvedev said at an economic forum in Siberia. 
Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister and former Ambassador to NATO, took to Twitter to call for an international push to create a warning system for all ""objects of an alien origin"". Neither the US nor Russia had the capability to bring down such objects, he added.

"Ever since he was diagnosed HIV positive, Moses King, 48, has had one major problem. He has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV positive - widespread in Liberia - and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and distributed by the Liberian government. But King and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat. A subsistence farmer, he grew vegetables and bought rice. 
But meat and fish - expensive, luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein - remained elusive. ""Subsistence farming allowed us to survive, but we had so many problems,"" said King. ""We could not get any protein, and we were not getting the nutrients we needed to sustain ourselves."" Pate K Chon, a counsellor who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia, provided an unlikely solution. Since watching a documentary about a fish farm in Thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in Liberia, enabling HIV sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein. 
""I saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea,"" said Chon, herself diagnosed with HIV in 1992. ""So many of the people I work with don't have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein - it doesn't cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm."" 
Chon, founder of a faith-based NGO, began building a pool in which to farm fish. In June 2012, Chon met John Sheehy, a 'strategic philanthropist' and founder of consultancy Emerging Business Lab, who raised money for the non-profit fish farm in the northeast of Monrovia, Liberia's capital, and set about learning aquaculture, doing an online course through Cornell University and speaking to other fish farmers in Africa. 
""I raised the money and built the farm, learned the proper tank layout and water flow system,"" said Sheehy. ""A lot of my knowledge was self-taught, and now I would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people,"" he added. 
The project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm, with 12 tanks, which, when fully stocked, will each have 5,000 fish - providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 predominantly HIV-positive people, including King and his family. 
In addition to the fish, waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops, also providing food and income for the community, made up of 503 women, 206 men and 346 children. 
""The members of the community live near the farm, and have agreed to be part of the co-operative,"" said Sheehy. ""Many work on the farm, or tending the crops, and what they get in return - when the fish are fully grown after 90 days - is fish. They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items. 
""The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society - now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week."" 
According to Liberia's demographic health survey, 1.5% of Liberia's 3.5 million people are HIV positive, with 60% of those women or girls. Stigma and discrimination still surround the illness, and have led to around half of all cases in the country going untreated. 
Good nutrition is particularly important for people with HIV. Research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth. ""Nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs,"" said Chon. ""The drugs are toxic and, if you don't have food to eat, they can make you very ill. But food in Liberia is very expensive. We buy expensive imported rice, even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford."" 
Sheehy says Grow2Feed is the first co-operative fish farm in Liberia to operate for the benefit of an HIV-positive community. The project has attracted the interest of the Liberian government, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, which has worked with Grow2Feed to provide training, will also support teaching at the University of Liberia. 
Fish farming experts say the practice has huge potential in Africa. 
""Fish farming is absolutely viable in Africa,"" said Paul White, owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year. ""A lot of the fish on the market comes from China and is imported frozen. It is of a quality that could never enter Europe or America. There has been a serious lack of investment and a lack of know-how in fish production. It is all coming to the forefront now,"" he added. 
Some critics are sceptical of farmed fish, citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins. But Sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems. ""A lot of farmed fish is inbred, which does cause problems, but we are using a process with local fish sourced in Liberia, not fish from another region,"" said Sheehy. ""That means we can continue using local fish to bring in new broodstock. ""And we are not using lakes that are cornered off, where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake. We can control the environment using the tanks, and we test the water and monitor it constantly."" 
Sheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout Liberia and the region. ""A rice-growing co-op in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from Nigeria and Central America,"" said Sheehy. ""But we operate 100% non-profit and we will never lose our social justice aspect.""

"They call it the Richie Rich Club and it is about to get even richer. India's wealthiest will quadruple their net worth between now and 2018, a report says, with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors becoming multimillionaires. The survey, based on interviews with 150 ultra-high-net-worth individuals, comes amid signs of returning business confidence in the world's biggest democracy. 
Recent years have seen lacklustre growth, rising prices of basic foodstuffs and a weakening currency. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a landslide victory in May 2014 on a pledge to reinvigorate the ailing economy. Despite the slowdown, there are nearly a sixth more Indians worth in excess of $3.75m than in 2013, the report for the Kotak Mahindra Bank notes. ""Cities are mushrooming, the middle class population growing, opportunities have increased manyfold and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months,"" according to Murali Balaraman, a co-author. 
Between them, India's rich hold assets worth a trillion dollars, which is around a fifth of the total wealth in the country. By 2018, that total is likely to reach $4tn, the report says, making three times as many people multimillionaires. 
Serving the new rich - and the old money - is a booming luxury market. ""They really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and consumption of luxury goods is a nice way to do it,"" Balaraman said. Abhay Gupta, the CEO of brand consultancy Luxury Connect, said the market for top-end goods and experiences would ""only get bigger"". ""There is a huge aspirational class who look up to what the very wealthy are doing and then copy it,"" he said. 
Cars are among the most popular items bought, the report says. Whereas, in 2009, locally made SUVs were shown off by the wealthy, now only foreign cars will turn heads. Mercedes saw a 47% surge in sales in India in 2013. BMW has launched a new $200,000 model in Delhi. India's appalling infrastructure restricts demand, however. Lamborghini's Chief Executive, Stephan Winkelmann, admitted, in 2013, that the traffic and roads in India ""are not so suitable"" for the $450,000 sports cars. In India, Lamborghini sells two models: the Gallardo and the Aventador, which has a top speed of 217mph. Winkelmann said Lamborghini's Indian customers were much younger than those in Europe, with a typical buyer being in his 30s. However, the most popular investments remain real estate - mainly within India - and jewellery. 
India's super-rich have long raised eyebrows around the world with their spectacular spending. Mukesh Ambani, the country's wealthiest man, has built the world's most valuable home in Mumbai, the commercial capital. The 27-storey tower, complete with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600, is worth an estimated $1bn. 
The three-day wedding of the niece of Lakshmi Mittal, the UK-based steel tycoon who is worth an estimated $16bn, was reported to have cost $80m. Hundreds of guests were flown to Barcelona for the ceremony and party, which took place in a museum in the city. 
But buyers of luxury goods searching for the psychological satisfaction of exclusivity are becoming increasingly demanding, the Kotak Mahindra report says. One ordered nine cases of Japanese whisky costing over $750 a bottle for a wedding reception. The attraction of the imported whisky was that no one who attended the wedding would find out how to source the same drink in India, the report adds. Another big spender systematically bought identical pairs of Louis Vuitton bags, then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her accessories. Even the traditional wedding is evolving fast. Presents such as silver plates, dried fruit or sweets once sent with wedding invitations are being replaced by gifts by top western designer brands. ""These days, it's Rolex watches and Louis Vuitton bags,"" says Gupta. 
Almost half new ultra-high-net-worth individuals live in smaller provincial cities. A high proportion give substantial amounts to charity, though the report notes that the ""growth of philanthropic spends in India has not been proportional to overall growth in ultra-high-net-worth individual wealth"". 
Co-author Balaraman says that growth in the number of rich people would not result in social tensions as a wide gap in incomes and wealth is an ""accepted norm"" in India. ""People know that someone is rich and someone is poor and they carry on with their lives,"" he explains.

"When you picture mountain climbers scaling Mount Everest, what probably comes to mind are teams of climbers with Sherpa guides leading them to the summit, equipped with oxygen masks, supplies and tents. And in most cases you'd be right, as 97 per cent of climbers use oxygen to ascend to Everest's summit at 8,850 metres above sea level. The thin air at high altitudes makes most people breathless at 3,500 metres, and the vast majority of climbers use oxygen past 7,000 metres. A typical climbing group will have 8-15 people in it, with an almost equal number of guides, and they'll spend weeks to get to the top after reaching Base Camp.
But ultra-distance and mountain runner Kilian Jornet Burgada ascended the mountain in May 2017 alone, without an oxygen mask or fixed ropes for climbing.
Oh, and he did it in 26 hours.
With food poisoning.
And then, five days later, he did it again, this time in only 17 hours.
Born in 1987, Kilian has been training for Everest his whole life. And that really does mean his whole life, as he grew up 2,000 metres above sea level in the Pyrenees in the ski resort of Lles de Cerdanya in Catalonia, north-eastern Spain. While other children his age were learning to walk, Kilian was on skis. At one and a half years old he did a five-hour hike with his mother, entirely under his own steam. He left his peers even further behind when he climbed his first mountain and competed in his first cross-country ski race at age three. By age seven, he had scaled a 4,000er and, at ten, he did a 42-day crossing of the Pyrenees.
He was 13 when he says he started to take it 'seriously' and trained with the Ski Mountaineering Technical Centre (CTEMC) in Catalonia, entering competitions and working with a coach. At 18, he took over his own ski-mountaineering and trail-running training, with a schedule that only allows a couple of weeks of rest a year. He does as many as 1,140 hours of endurance training a year, plus strength training and technical workouts as well as specific training in the week before a race. For his record-breaking ascent and descent of the Matterhorn, he prepared by climbing the mountain ten times until he knew every detail of it, even including where the sun would be shining at every part of the day.
Sleeping only seven hours a night, Kilian Jornet seems almost superhuman. His resting heartbeat is extremely low at 33 beats per minute, compared with the average man's 60 per minute or an athlete's 40 per minute. He breathes more efficiently than average people too, taking in more oxygen per breath, and he has a much faster recovery time after exercise as his body quickly breaks down lactic acid - the acid in muscles that causes pain after exercise.
All this is thanks to his childhood in the mountains and to genetics, but it is his mental strength that sets him apart. He often sets himself challenges to see how long he can endure difficult conditions in order to truly understand what his body and mind can cope with. For example, he almost gave himself kidney failure after only drinking 3.5 litres of water on a 100km run in temperatures of around 40degC.
It would take a book to list all the races and awards he's won and the mountains he's climbed. And even here, Kilian's achievements exceed the average person as, somehow, he finds time to record his career on his blog and has written three books, Run or Die, The Invisible Border and Summits of My Life.",C1
"John Travolta, still in mourning over the death of his teenage son earlier this year, issued a rare public statement urging fans to see his latest movie, The Taking of Pelham 123, which he filmed last year.
John Travolta stars as a villainous ex-inmate in The Taking of Pelham 123, which opens in theaters Friday.
 I promise, you wo n't be disappointed, said Travolta, who plays a deranged ex-inmate who takes hostages on a New York subway.
Travolta did not join co-star Denzel Washington in the promotional tour for the movie -- which hits theaters Friday -- because he said his family needed additional time to reconcile our loss. 
His son Jett, 16, was found unconscious on January 2 while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas. The teen was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said.
Washington, who plays a subway train dispatcher forced to face down Travolta's character, said he talked to the actor about three weeks ago.
 Needless to say, he's struggling, Washington said in an interview last week.
Travolta's statement, which can be read on his official Web site, said Washington, director Tony Scott and the producers stepped up without hesitation to help promote this wonderful film, and their unselfish efforts have allowed my family the additional time to reconcile our loss. 
Making the movie was a labor of love, Travolta said.
 Tony gave me the freedom to define, and then to become, the ultimate evil mastermind, he said. This role as an actor gave me the chance to dispense with all moral and ethical limitations, and explore just how bad this character could really be. I believe you will like the result. 
Much of the movie is a dialogue between Washington and Travolta's character over a two-way radio.
Many of the action shots were filmed in New York subway tunnels.

TAP FOR INGREDIENTS
Method
Preheat the oven to 220degC/425degF/gas 7.
Whack the lemongrass against your work surface and remove the tough outer layer. Peel the shallot and ginger, deseed the chillies, then roughly chop everything with the lemongrass. Add to a large pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and the lime leaves (discard the stalks) and pound to a paste.
Toast the peanuts in a large frying pan over a medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden, then bash half into the paste. Add the tomato puree and fish sauce, finely grate in the lime zest and squeeze in all the juice, then muddle together.
With a sharp knife, score the sea bass skin at 1cm intervals in a criss-cross fashion, then rub all over with the paste, both inside and out.
Get your banana leaf (if using), or tear off a piece of baking paper five times as long as the fish and fold it in half to give you double thickness. Place the fish in the middle, then fold over to seal the fish snuggly inside. Place on a large baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, or until the flesh is succulent and comes away easily from the bone.
To make the rice, drizzle the vegetable oil into a saucepan over a medium heat. Crumble in the creamed coconut, then squeeze in the lime juice, throwing in the squeezed lime halves. Tip in the rice and fry for 2 minutes, then pour over 1 mug of boiling water and turn down the heat to low. Cover and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to steam for a further 3 minutes.
For the chilli pickle, finely slice the chillies and place in a small bowl with the sugar, vinegar and a pinch of salt, then mix together and leave aside.
Now make the salad. Crack open the coconut and finely grate 50g of flesh into a serving bowl. Halve the sugar snaps and mangetout, finely shred both cabbages and cucumber, then peel and finely slice the mango and add it all to the bowl. Pick in most of the herb leaves, squeeze over the lime juice and toss together.
Pop the fish on a serving platter. Roughly crush the remaining peanuts in a pestle and mortar, then scatter over the salad and the fish. Drizzle the fish with the soy sauce and scatter over the remaining salad herbs.
Take the fish, chilli pickle, rice and salad to the table and let everyone help themselves.
Tips
You can pick up banana leaves at good Asian supermarkets or online. If using, briefly hold it over the flame of your gas hob - this will make it pliable, and therefore easier to wrap around your fish, but it will also get the oils going for maximum flavour.",C1
"The world shares him and London claims him but Stratford-upon-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating William Shakespeare as their man: the bard of Avon, born in the Warwickshire market town in 1564, who died there 400 years ago. Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. 
""People have seen Shakespeare as someone who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,"" he said. ""But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford."" The seveneenth-century diarist, antiquarian and gossip John Aubrey, born 11 years after Shakespeare died, was at pains to point out there was nothing so very special about the bard. Aubrey, university educated, unlike Shakespeare, said that he acted ""exceedingly well"" and that ""his Playes took well "". The world has not agreed with Aubrey. The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be marked across Britain and the globe. 
Macbeth will open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour in the history of theatre, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country - North Korea is still holding out. In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeare's plays, along the South Bank. 
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary. Interpretations will range from the resolutely traditional to the Brighton-based Spymonkey's Complete Deaths, a romp through the 74 deaths - 75 including a fly squashed in Titus 
Andronicus - by stabbing, poisoning, smothering and smashing across the plays. There will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences, films, concerts, operas and major exhibitions. 
For a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeare's life and times. The plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could find - drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors' parts and 17 plays not known in any other version - into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare's death. 
The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display - including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in France. Some of the most precious surviving documents will be gathered together in an exhibition at Somerset House in London, jointly organized by the National Archives and King's College London, including four of his six known signatures, which are all slightly different. 
The exhibition, By Me, William Shakespeare, will include his will, the court papers relating to the audacious move when Shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the Thames and rebuilt it as the Globe on the South Bank, and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for Boxing Day performances for James I and Queen Anne. 
The outgoing Globe director, Dominic Dromgoole, recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner - albeit conceding ""some spurious claim"" by Stratford-upon-Avon. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. His old school room is being restored with a GBP1.4m Heritage Lottery grant and will open as a permanent visitor attraction. 
Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, where he died, according to literary legend, on St George's Day, 23 April, the same day as his birth. ""You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,"" Paul Edmondson said. ""The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare."" 
Edmondson believes that, after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as ""the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations"" but, in truth, it is more of a gaping hole where the gem should be. 
Shakespeare's house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it, probably incorporating some of the original fabric, was flattened in 1759 by an irascible clergyman, Francis Gastrell, in a row over taxes. He had already cut down Shakespeare's mulberry tree, under which the writer is said to have sat and worked, because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden. 
The gap in the Stratford streetscape has never been filled but a five-year archaeology project has peeled back the years and the news that Shakespeare's kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world. The whole site is being redisplayed for the anniversary, with the foundations marked and the garden restored. ""Without Stratford,"" Edmondson said, ""there would have been no Shakespeare.""

"In an ever-evolving, increasingly crowded beverage market, Starbucks is waking up and smelling the coffee. The problem is it's not their house blend.
 Here's a statistic that people are surprised by. Despite the long-term success that we 've enjoyed, we have less than 10 percent share of coffee consumption in North America. And less -LSB- than -RSB- 1 percent share internationally, Starbucks Chairman, President and CEO Howard Schultz told CNN Money.
Advertising Age also recently pointed out that despite Starbucks being the world's largest coffeehouse chain with more than 13,000 locations in more than 50 countries, even its most devout customers purchase only three of every 10 cups of coffee they drink from Starbucks.
So, who is stealing Starbucksmojo ?
Folgers, a division of J.M. Smucker Co., is still the largest producer of retail packaged coffee in the United States. Its coffee brands include Folgers and Millstone, and it also manufactures and distributes Dunkin' Donuts coffee to sell in grocery stores.
Then there is the other American coffee titan, Maxwell House, which is a Kraft Foods brand.
Kraft reported soaring earnings in its 2010 first quarter, linking the growth to new advertising and innovation behind existing Kraft brands such as Maxwell House.
This competition is stirring Starbucks to step up its home-brewed strategy, partially by adding some flavor.
An AC Nielsen panel recently found that more than 11 percent of American households purchase flavored coffee for home use, making it a $265 million business in the United States.
Starbucks Corp. will enter the fray in June when Starbucks Natural Fusions, in vanilla, caramel and cinnamon, arrives at grocery stores.
Additionally, Starbucks wants to capture a larger share of the U.S. brewed coffee market by leaning on its VIA Ready Brew line and Seattle's Best coffee brand to increase the number of distribution points. Starbucks acquired its former competitor, Seattle's Best Coffee, seven years ago.
 We are uniquely positioned to reach into these channels because of the brand equity and trust we build with the customers who come into our stores, Starbucks said in a statement to CNN.
Seattle's Best, in part, will take aim against Starbuckstypically lower-priced, quick-service rivals such as McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. In a new rebranding effort, Starbucks plans to distribute the Seattle's Best brand in Burger King and Subway restaurants nationwide.
McDonald's coffee sales have increased every year since the company first introduced its McCafe line of premium coffee in 2006. In April, McDonald's announced its U.S. comparable sales rose 3.8 percent, citing beverages, including the new McCafe offerings such as Frappes, as a top contributor to that growth.
Despite all this, Starbucks CEO Schultz said the expanding marketplace might just be an advantage to all of its players.
 The level of awareness that was created by McDonald'stens of millions of dollars of advertising created more trial in the marketplace and differentiation.

"Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities. 
British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their country's wealth, when they actually ""only"" own 23%. Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%. 
Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. Russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%. 
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. In India, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do. 
Why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities? 
It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. For example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not affiliate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. This will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. 
People also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesn't quite fit the question. Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. In Daniel Kahneman's terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of ""fast"" thinking, rather than ""slow"". 
We are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our Indian sample's massively overestimating their population's access to the internet. Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey - and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more affluent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. In some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality - those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. But what we find, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are. 
We suffer from what social psychologists call ""emotional innumeracy"" when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. Cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern. 
For Britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for people's huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to official estimates). People are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is reflected in them overstating the scale of the issues. 
But, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. For example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. Britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again - 62% are either overweight or obese. 
And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. The top 1% in Russia own 70% of the nation's wealth, while the top 1% in New Zealand only own 18%. Half of Italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in Norway. 
The average age in India is 27; it is 47 in Japan. Only 10% of politicians are women in Brazil, Hungary and Japan, when 44% are in Sweden. 
When the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder we're so wrong.

"Britain joined the U.S. and its allies in the fight against ISIS -- but any mission will come with a huge price tag.
The UK parliament has approved airstrikes in Iraq against the terror group which prime minister David Cameron has called one of staggering brutality.
Cameron had said Britain should join international allies in combating ISIS, an action that he warned would take not just months, but years. 
While the total cost will depend on the intensity and length of operation, past experience can give some guidance, Malcolm Chalmers, research director from the Royal United Services Institute said.
Chalmers pointed to the UK's seven month involvement in Libya through 2011, which cost around $390 million, including missiles and flight hours.
The bill is additional to standard defense budgets, which include staffing costs and weapons spend. Last year, the UK defense budget was $60 billion.
Chalmers said he would expect the cost of ISIS airstrikes to be in the ballpark, of the Libya operation, assuming we only use air power and the campaign lasts for a couple of years. 
Cameron has said that the mission against ISIS could last years. However, it is U.S.-led rather than the operation in Libya, in which European countries took the lead.
` Uniquemissiles
Cameron, in Friday's debate aimed at convincing parliament to approve airstrikes, said Britain has unique assets no other coalition ally can contribute.
Cameron named the Brimstone precision missile, which he said minimized risk of civilian casualties, as one only Britain could contribute. The missiles can target convoys as well as fast moving, fleeting targets that were previously harder to strike, according to IHS Jane's senior weapons analyst Ben Goodlad.
The Brimstone, which travels at supersonic speed, is a 1.8-meter missile weighing just under 50 kg. Advanced radar equipment enables it to guides itself to the target, so pilots do n't need to maneuver to release it. IHS Jane's estimates each missile costs around $240,000.
Brimstone missiles are compatible with the UK's Tornado GR4 aircraft. The aircraft were used by British troops for relief missions in northern Iraq just over a month ago. Six of these are ready for deployment at the UK's RAF base in Cyprus.
Flying the Tornadoes costs around $57,000 per hour, according to information released in a parliamentary debate about Libya in 2011. From the Cyprus base, the aircraft could reach Iraq in just over an hour.
Goodlad said the RAF also has Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which cost $1.3 million each, and submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles. These can be used to target areas that ca n't be accessed by planes, for example due to defenses, and cost round $1.5 million each.
U.S. forces have been using Tomahawk missiles for airstrikes in Syria earlier this week -- dropping 47 of them on Monday evening.
In total, the U.S. has conducted 20 strikes in Syria and 198 in Iraq from August 8 through September 23.
Many of those operations were n't included in the Pentagon's daily average spending figure of $7.5 million at the end of last month.

"Barack Obama has urged young people to reject pessimism and interact with those who have different beliefs if they want to make changes in the world. 
On the final day of his last visit to Britain as US president, Obama told 500 youth leaders at a town hall meeting in London: ""I'm here to ask you to reject the notion there are forces we can't control. As JFK said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man."" 
""You've never had better tools to make a difference,"" he told the A-level and UK -US exchange students at the Q&A session. ""Reject pessimism, cynicism and know that progress is possible. Progress is not inevitable; it requires struggle, discipline and faith."" 
But Obama acknowledged the challenges faced by young people: ""Not to say your generation has had it easy, in a time of breathtaking change, from 9/11, 7/7 ... and during an age of information and Twitter where there's a steady stream of bad news."" 
The audience cheered as the president was introduced and went on to speak about his policies, including healthcare and education. 
He urged the audience to interact with people with different political beliefs: ""Seek out people who don't agree with you and it will also help you to compromise."" 
Obama also said: ""You should feel encouraged social attitudes are changing. That doesn't mean it's fast enough but you should keep pushing and it's in part due to the courageous acts of young people like yourself."" 
When asked about his presidential legacy, Obama said he was proud of the healthcare reforms, which received huge cheers from the audience, and said of the US response to the 2008 financial crisis: ""Saving the world from great depression - that was quite good."" 
He also listed diplomatic deals with Iran and the response to the Ebola crisis as highlights of his presidency. ""I'm proud; I think I've been true to myself during this process."" 
But he added: ""Don't give up and succumb to cynics if, after five years, poverty hasn't been eradicated ... It's OK. Dr Martin Luther King says the arc of the moral universe is long but bends towards justice."" 
Questioned on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), he said: ""The answer to globalization is not to pull up the drawbridge and shut off,"" though it was crucial to pay attention to workers' rights. 
Before Obama arrived, Tanya Williams, a community engagement officer, told the Guardian: ""I love Michelle but I like Obama and it's exciting to have the chance to hear someone who has changed so much and galvanized so many people who didn't vote before."" 
Oliver Sidorczuk, 26, said: ""Everyone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say. I'm going to ask him about electoral rights and try to ask him if he would join our campaign to ask David Cameron for automatic registration."" 
Obama ended the session by taking a question from a young Sikh Londoner, who asked about the issue of racial profiling at airports and being mistaken for a Muslim. 
Obama said that, although there were people with ""crazy ideology"", pluralism was important. ""I visited a mosque a few months ago and said our greatest allies are American Muslims who are most integrated and economically well off,"" he said. 
Furqan Naeem, a campaigner from Manchester, said: ""I recently visited the States through the US embassy on the community leaders programme and saw first hand some really important work the president did in celebrating America's diversity and bringing communities together."" 
Kenny Imafidon, the managing director of the youth organization ClearView Research, said afterwards: ""It was a great opportunity and what will stick with me is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises. Also, the thing he said about being a good leader and finding great talent."" 
Later, Obama met Jeremy Corbyn, who said they had an ""excellent"" 90-minute discussion. 
The Labour leader said they talked about ""the challenges facing postindustrial societies and the power of global corporations, and the increasing use of technology around the world and the effect that it has.""
Asked if they talked about the president's intervention in the debate on Britain's membership of the EU, Corbyn said it was discussed briefly. 
After the meeting, Obama joined Cameron to play golf at the Grove in Chandlers Cross, Hertfordshire. Obama ended the day at a dinner with the prime minister and the US ambassador, Matthew Barzun, at the ambassador's residence, before travelling on to Germany.  ",C1
"When two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away. 
The man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said. 
""His condition isn't good, but he's getting better,"" said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said his name was Jose Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. ""The boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,"" Fjeldstad told reporters. 
According to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll - which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet - to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital. 
The government airline's only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. ""He's staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,"" said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. ""We've been giving him a lot of water and he's gaining strength."" 
Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the man's story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since ""they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it"". Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes - ""lots of fluid"" - then move on to the blood. 
he major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. ""The basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesn't rain for a few days, so you can't collect rainwater, you have basically had it."" Individual physiology also plays a part, he said, with some people better suited to survival than others. ""The mental thing is key and that's often down to people's situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship."" 
Stories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. ""It just doesn't sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. One would want to know a lot more."" 
More castaways: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and his family were sailing to the Galapagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales. They survived 38 days on a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing fishing trawler. 
In 2006, three Mexican fishermen were discovered drifting in a small boat near the Marshall Islands, nine months after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition. They apparently survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. Before being rescued by the US coastguard, the men stayed alive by eating tuna. A Panamanian fisherman sued Princess Cruises in 2012 after one of their ships ignored cries for help from him and two companions who were stranded in their broken boat. He survived 28 days adrift, but his friends both died of thirst.

"Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor.
The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker government gave the green light to the Iranian warships Friday, state media reported. They are expected to be the first Iranian warships to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution.
The canal is an internal body of water, and as such, Egypt has sovereignty over it. But Egypt also is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal.
Last week, Egypt's newly empowered military government said it would honor all its international treaties. That would include Camp David.
 This is awkward -- at a minimum, said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply ship -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean. Both are armed with missiles, he said, adding that their passage would create more uncertainty in the region.
 It's destabilizing. It raises tension, particularly in this time of transition in Egypt, Schenker said. This is typical of Syrian-Iranian opportunism. 
Egypt's decision, analysts said, could show the direction that the military caretakers intend to take the Arab world's most populous nation.
 It does raise an unwelcome political issue that has to be resolved, said Cmdr. James Kraska of the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island.
Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency.
Asked about Iran's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, My initial response to that would be we 're highly skeptical of that. 
Asked whether he was concerned about the shipstravel plans, he said, It's not really about the ships. It's what are the ships carrying, what's their destination, what's the cargo on board, where is it going, to whom, for what benefit. We have, you know, ongoing concerns. 
Those concerns were shared by the White House, where Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One, We 're monitoring that, obviously, but we also would say that Iran does not have a great track record for responsible behavior in the region, which is always a concern for us. 
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel's allies should pay close attention to the situation.
 We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place, he said.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies.
The Suez Canal is a key waterway for international trade. It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go around Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day en route to Europe and North America.

"During the height of the 2009 financial crisis, when there was a real and present danger of banks seizing up due to a lack of liquidity, the then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown altered the geopolitical architecture.
Brown moved with a sense of urgency to formalize the Group of 20 nations.
The strategy was sound. He wanted to bring countries representing 80 % of GDP under one umbrella, bridge the gap between the developed and the developing world and, most importantly, tap the $4 trillion of surplus funds that still exist within the BRICS economies.
In the context of a financial crisis, the strategy worked. Four years later, however, geopolitics is trumping economics. The G20 has become an unwieldy group of countries with different priorities, and without political backing from Washington.
According to Brown, who I interviewed earlier this year, America should actually be more alert to the possibilities of international cooperation in both trade and agreements for growth. 
A global trade agreement, the much-talked about pivot to Asia, and even serious concerns around capital flight out of emerging markets and their currencies will be overshadowed at this G20. Syria will be top of the agenda when the leaders convene in Russia's western outpost of St. Petersburg.
Focus is on the tensions between host Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama. Their verbal jousting could further divide the G20, strategists suggest. The BRICS are, as a rule, not in favor of the military intervention being trumpeted by Washington and Paris.
 Business has taken a back seat and it should move to the front seat, Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, chairman of the executive committee at the private equity group Abraaj told me. Politics tops the agenda. 
The business agenda is headed by the near-panic reaction to a planned tapering of bond purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke uttered word of that change in strategy back in May, money has been flooding out of emerging markets.
Ahead of this week's summit senior Chinese finance officials went out of their way to suggest, during a news conference in Beijing, the Federal Reserve should be more cautious with its approach.
China's Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao welcomed signs of the U.S. recovery but said Washington must consider the spill-over effect of its monetary policy, especially the opportunity and rhythm of its exit from the ultra-loose monetary policy. 
The end of easy money or loose monetary policy in the U.S. is exposing the cracks in the emerging markets, which rode a decade-long, powerful wave of commodity-driven growth.
Without that export demand for grains, gold, palm oil, rubber, minerals and even manufactured goods, economies such as Brazil, India, South Africa, Turkey and Indonesia have seen their current account deficits balloon and their currencies plummet.
The India rupee is down more than 20 % this year, most of that loss in the past quarter alone, as the country posted the worst growth in four years. Brazil and Indonesia have seen their currencies tumble 10 %, requiring central banks to use currency reserves and in some cases interest rate hikes to stop the bleeding.
The tendency is for investors to make comparisons to the 1998/1999 Asian financial crisis, when those economies had wide current account deficits and a mountain of foreign currency government debt.
 Most of Asia learned a lesson, Marios Maratheftis, global head of macro research at Standard Chartered Bank told me. The bulk of emerging market debt is now issued in local currencies.
Maratheftis said the sudden stop of capital flows to the emerging markets will create problems for those with widening current account deficits, but that this should not develop into a crisis provided there is a greater coordination of policies.
He is not holding out great hope for the discussions in St. Petersburg. They talk global when they meet, he said of the G20. But act local when they go home.

"Many of the major supermarket chains have come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts over the past decade. They've wasted tonnes of food, they've underpaid their suppliers and they've contributed to excessive plastic waste in their packaging, which has had its impact on our environment.
But supermarkets and grocers are starting to sit up and take notice. In response to growing consumer backlash against the huge amounts of plastic waste generated by plastic packaging, some of the largest UK supermarkets have signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage. In a pledge to reuse, recycle or compost all plastic wastage by 2025, supermarkets are now beginning to take some responsibility for the part they play in contributing to the damage to our environment, with one major supermarket announcing their plan to eliminate all plastic packaging in their own-brand products by 2023.
In response to criticisms over food waste, some supermarkets are donating some of their food surplus. However, charities estimate that they are only accessing two per cent of supermarkets' total food surplus, so this hardly seems to be solving the problem. Some say that supermarkets are simply not doing enough. Most supermarkets operate under a veil of secrecy when asked for exact figures of food wastage, and without more transparency it is hard to come up with a systematic approach to avoiding waste and to redistributing surplus food.
Some smaller companies are now taking matters into their own hands and offering consumers a greener, more environmentally friendly option. Shops like Berlin's Original Unverpakt and London's Bulk Market are plastic-free shops that have opened in recent years, encouraging customers to use their own containers or compostable bags. Online grocer Farmdrop eliminates the need for large warehouses and the risk of huge food surplus by delivering fresh produce from local farmers to its customers on a daily basis via electric cars, offering farmers the lion's share of the retail price.
There is no doubt that we still have a long way to go in reducing food waste and plastic waste. But perhaps the major supermarkets might take inspiration from these smaller grocers and gradually move towards a more sustainable future for us all.",C1
"Music subscription services, including Spotify and Deezer, have broken through the $1bn sales barrier worldwide, as increasing numbers of fans choose to pay for music online. 
Streaming and subscription revenues rose by more than 50% in 2013 to reach $1.1bn, helping overall sales of recorded music in Europe grow for the first time in 12 years, according to figures published in March 2014. 
There are now an estimated 450 music-rental services around the world, and, while many people still listen for free, a desire for more choice is persuading more music lovers to part with their cash. In a three-year period, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). 
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD. Consumers say they are attracted by a cheap, user-friendly and legal alternative to pirated downloads. ""It is now clear that music streaming and subscription is a mainstream model for our business,"" said IFPI Chief Executive, Frances Moore. There are signs that, in Britain and America, streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apple's iTunes. Subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the balance, but the IFPI data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates. 
In the US, the percentage of people claiming to use subscription and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%. In Britain, downloaders remained static, at exactly one third, while subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. In Sweden, France and Italy, streaming is already more popular than downloading. 
Digital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly GBP5.9bn out of GBP15bn, and, while sales of CDs and vinyl declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industry's income. A recent crash in music sales in Japan, which accounts for one fifth of music industry sales and where physical formats remained popular for longer than elsewhere, meant sales across all formats globally fell 3.9%. 
However, vinyl continued to make a comeback in some markets. Sales increased by 32% in America and by 101% in the UK in 2013. 
The IFPI also said that One Direction were the biggest-selling artists of 2013, with 4m physical and digital sales for their Midnight Memories album. Katy Perry's Prism was the best-selling album by a female artist, in sixth place behind Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and Daft Punk. 
Consumer-technology companies have been racing to join the music-streaming trend, with Apple launching iTunes Radio and Google promoting its Play Store, with smaller players like Beats Music, created by the team behind the Beats headphones brand, also joining the fray.

"Freelancing, by definition, involves offering your skills
to a variety of clients. You are claiming some specialist
expertise, be it in management consultancy, journalism,
graphic design or vehicle repair. But whatever it is, in
order to make that claim, you must either have done the
job before, or be trained in it in some convincingly
applied way.
It is possible to become a freelance
designer, for instance, on the basis of
having done a degree course because
such courses are generally practically
oriented. Or you could become a
translator having taken a language
degree.
Your credentials would be less impressive if you tried to
set up as a management consultant, having had no
experience other than a business studies qualification, or
if you tried to become a journalist on the basis of an
English degree. The first thing you will have to do as a
freelancer, therefore, is to see that your level of expertise
is appropriate to the area where you want to apply it as a
freelancer.
In many cases, freelancers are ex-employees and they
generally begin by working for their ex-employers. A
common situation, for instance, is that a company closes
down a functional area like in-house PR or building
maintenance and asks the people who were doing it
before to take it on as freelancers.
This means that the freelancers can
offer the same service to a variety of
clients without incurring the overheads
that become attached to corporate
activities. Quite often, a function that
is uneconomic for a firm to sustain,
either for that reason or because it is
not fully used, becomes very
profitable to freelancers.
As a freelancer, each approach to a new client is rather
like applying for another job and, as with a job
application, establishing your credibility by showing that
you can do what the job entails is an essential first step.
One way to do that is to demonstrate that you are already
busy, and a list of existing clients - particularly if they
are well-known ones - validates that claim. Some
freelancers do this informally.
For instance, a cameraman said
recently, 'I never admit I haven't got
much on. The way I put it is that I've
got a spare week or so between
assignments and I mention a couple of
things coming up, even if they're not
definite at that time. But if I went in
and said ""I'm a bit short of work at the
moment - anything doing?"" they'd
assume I was going off a bit and
wouldn't offer me anything.'
In other branches of freelancing, formal evidence of
work done needs to be produced. Some kind of brochure
with the names of your clients and what you did for
them is a good investment as soon as you have worked
for a sufficient number of companies.
Working as a freelancer is in many ways different from
working as an employee. Consider, for example, this
fundamental difference between the two situations. If
you are permanently based in the next office or at least
in the same building as the person or department to
whom you are reporting, it is easy to check back and
clarify aspects of the job as you go along. As a
freelancer though, you are on your own and in many
cases the client is paying you to get on with the job
without bothering him or her.
So if you have been commissioned as
a freelance copywriter, for instance,
the person who commissioned you
does not want to have to deal with
last-minute queries about whether he
or she wants a reply coupon to go with
the ad. These are the sort of questions
that should have been raised at the
briefing session.
That's the kind of mistake that comes from
inexperience. If you have done similar work for an
organisation before, you probably know what is
expected. But in the case of a first-time assignment it's
all uncharted territory. Picking up how to go about
doing such work has to be learned and the best way of
doing so is with people who already know you and vice
versa.
In these circumstances, you will at
least be tolerant of each other's
mistakes and not ask for the
temperamentally or functionally
impossible. For instance, if the person
you are reporting to is careless about
checking subordinates' work, that
places an extra burden on you to be
correspondingly careful.
How ready your existing contacts are to put freelance
assignments your way is an invaluable clue as to how
marketable your skills are. To some extent you should
know from your own experience what the demand is for
freelancers in your chosen sphere.
For instance, if you are a technical
illustrator, you ought to be aware of
whether there are enough technical
publishers who employ outsiders
rather than in-house staff and, if so,
what the rates of pay are. If the
demand is strong or rising, how
successful you are likely to be depends
on your own skill and speed.
The question of your own ability is one that has to be
faced in considering your chances. Freelancing is not an
easy option for those who cannot hold down a job on
grounds of competence. You have to be good at what
you do to freelance successfully because the client will
turn to someone else if you are not.",C1
"In higher education, science subjects are typically dominated by male students. This negatively impacts the world of work, as fewer females then go into the science, technology and engineering sectors. This essay will explore the reasons for the lack of gender diversity in science and suggest ways to create equal opportunities in this area.
The most likely reason for the imbalance is that society reinforces the idea that boys and girls have different interests and abilities. We see this from a very early age when little boys are given cars and Lego while girls get dolls. The former are encouraged to build things whereas the latter learn to care for others. Later on, we are told that girls are better at languages or boys have better spatial awareness. In fact, there is no evidence that biological differences between the sexes make one gender more talented than another at a particular subject. It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys.
Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.
Given these points, it is important to tackle this issue right from a child's early education. By the time young women are at university, it may already be too late to disprove the view that science is 'not for them'. Hence, for very young children gender-neutral play needs to be encouraged. As children get older, both the education system and the media must raise awareness of female achievements in the field of science, as well as exposing them to a more diverse set of characters in books and films. We need to find ways to show young girls that science is fun, interesting, and, most importantly, theirs too.

"Lego's profits rose strongly in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its Lego Movie , which has stormed box offices in the US and UK. 
The Danish toy firm's sales rose across Europe, the Americas and Asia as children snapped up products linked to the film. The film, released in February, took more than $250m in the US and GBP31m in the UK by the first weekend in April. 
The movie cost about $60m to make and has been described as a near-flawless piece of content marketing by creating entertaining content aimed at consumers who are likely to go out and buy the company's products. 
Lego's finance director, John Goodwin, said: ""The strong performance of the Lego Movie products had a positive effect during the first half of 2014, and it remains to be seen how the line will continue to develop behind the highly anticipated launch of the movie on DVD in the second half of 2014."" 
Operating profit for the first six months of Lego's financial year increased by 12% to $630m. Sales rose by 11% to more than three times the figure six years before. 
Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, Lego's chief executive, said: ""It is a very satisfactory result that shows our significant growth in recent years in a tough economic environment. The result for the first half of 2014 is an outcome of our ability to develop, launch and distribute Lego products, which children all over the world put at the top of their wishlists."" 
Lego, based in the small town of Billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a staple children's toy around the world by the 1970s. But the group lost its way and was on the brink of collapse in 2003. Knudstrop took over as chief executive, ending 70 years of family rule, and ditched hundreds of surplus products to refocus the business on its trademark bricks. 
The company opened its first factory in China in April and opened an office in Shanghai to spearhead expansion in the world's second- biggest economy.",C1
"The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the digital version of a traffic cop to handle the overload.
Servers hosting Web sites of the House of Representatives have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days.
 This is unprecedented, said Jeff Ventura, communications director for the House's chief administrator.
The tidal waves of e-mails and page views began after negotiators announced Sunday that a deal had been reached on legislation to enact a $700 billion bailout of the country's financial system.
In making the announcement, legislators said the public could view the agreement at financialservices.house.gov.
 In a short period of time, lots of Web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing, Ventura told CNN in a phone interview.
As millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan, the House.gov system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying this page does not appear. iReport.com: Do you support a bailout ?
Ventura compared the situation to the old days, when you listened to a radio show and the 10th caller got a toaster. Then everyone calls the same 1-800 number at the same time and all you got was a busy signal. 
 This was a massive digital busy signal, he said.
As more people gained access to the page and details of the bailout proposal were published in the news media, constituents then started to e-mail their representatives, Ventura explained.
 We know it's in the millions, he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the House have been receiving. But we have n't counted yet, because when you 're about to get hit by a tidal wave, you do n't count the drops of water in the wave. 
After the House failed to pass the proposed deal Monday by a vote of 228-205, the e-mail volume surged again, Ventura said.
 Because there were so many e-mails, it was impacting even the presentation of House.gov, he explained.
 This morning, our engineers sounded the alarms... and we have installed a digital version of a traffic cop. We enacted stopgaps that we planned for last night. We had hoped we did n't have to. 
The office of the chief administrative officer of the House of Representatives issued a statement Tuesday saying: This measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that congressional Web sites are not completely disabled by the millions of e-mails flowing into the system. Engineers are working diligently to accommodate this enormous traffic flow and we appreciate your patience in this matter. 
Now, when House.gov or individual memberssites begin to get overloaded, a message will come up on the computer screen saying, in effect, try back later, Ventura said.
 This really tells us that the level of constituent engagement on this issue is extremely high, he added.
He said after the failed vote Monday and the initial backlash, the House's Web site administrators thought there would be a drop in Web traffic -- especially with the Rosh Hashanah holiday.
 We monitored the situation all night long, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday, Ventura said.
He predicted that traffic on those Web sites would start to subside once there's some guidance on the marketplace and political landscape about what comes next. 
Ventura said the House.gov Web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days.

"Loud music pumps through huge speakers, front row guests cheer and a parade of stunning models electrifies the gleaming catwalk -- welcome to Africa Fashion Week London.
Currently in its third year, the glamorous event saw dozens of big names and up-and-coming designers from across the continent descending on the UK capital's hip district of Shoreditch to unveil their latest stylish creations.
 Our platform is about promoting emerging and established Africa-inspired designers, said Ronke Ademiluyi, founder of the event, held from August 1 to 3.
 The main thing is to bring attention to them, to showcase their creativity to the world so they get more global recognition for what they do and more appreciations for their brands as well. 
Vibrant colors
The runways featured designs from countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and Morocco -- but also from the diaspora, including Britain and the Caribbean.
In many ways, the event reaffirmed why Africa-inspired designs are fast catching the eye of the fashion world.
Mixing current trends with traditional patterns, more than 60 designers graced the catwalk with a wide array of colorful creations -- everything from show-stopping evening gowns and modern urban casualwear to bold textured prints and chic accessory lines.
Glorious colors in the desert: Darfur's fashionable women
Ademiluyi says the continent's fashion today represents a fusion of contemporary and African designs awash with a lot of vibrant colors and tribal trends. 
Amongst those giving a modern twist to traditional styles is Nigerian designer Fashola Olayinka with her Lagos-based label MOOFA Designs. Her latest collection, Ashake is celebrating the very powerful and strong women who turn heads wherever they go to. 
 That's basically what's the collection is about, says Olayinka, who started the label about four years ago. Women who are very feminine and sexy. 
The young designer says that despite the existing challenges, such as frequent power cuts, it's very exciting being part of Nigeria's fashion scene right now.
 We work hard and we party hard, so it's been really fun and it's a growing process in Nigeria, she says. Nigerians like to dress up and a lot of people in Nigeria are now wearing their own fabrics. 
Profile boost
But despite the growing interest in African designs, Ademiluyi says that many of the continent's promising talents still find it difficult to break into the mainstream international shows.
She says that for many of them, the week is a chance to shine on the international stage.
 A lot of them are talented but they 're struggling, she says. They do n't have support from anywhere, so what we do is we support them -- it's an affordable platform for the designers to showcase their talents to the world. 
South African fashion artist Steve Mandy agrees. He says that events like this help participants boost their profile both internationally and at home.
 You can meet some really important people here and I have already met some great people here that I think I 'll do business with, says Durban-based Mandy, known for hand-painting on dresses and t-shirts.
 The other thing is the spin-off in terms of your own image, in terms of our audience back in South Africa -- the fact that you can say that you did African Fashion Week it promotes you and helps your product to gain integrity. 
Looking ahead, Ademiluyi says the goal is to hold the event twice a year and also establish a supply platform that would make the designerscreations more accessible to the world.
 For a lot of them, after Africa Fashion Week, that's it, she says. The clients do n't know where to get their brand, so we hope to support the designers a lot more by opening up a distribution outlet.

"The government is bracing itself for thousands of legal claims from people who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the final days of the British Empire after the High Court in London ruled that three elderly Kenyans detained and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion have the right to sue for damages. 
The court on Friday rejected claims from the government's lawyers that too much time had elapsed since the seven-year insurgency in the 1950s, and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial. In 2011 the same High Court judge, Mr Justice McCombe, rejected the government's claim that the three claimants should be suing the Kenyan government as it had inherited Britain's legal responsibilities on independence in 1963. 
Human rights activists in Kenya estimate more than 5,000 of the 70,000-plus people detained by the British colonial authorities are still alive. Many may bring claims against the British government. The ruling may also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue. 
But many more men and women around the world who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the conflicts that often accompanied the British retreat from empire may also be considering claims: cases that could bring to light evidence of brutal mistreatment of colonial subjects and result in a new and uncomfortable understanding of recent British history. 
The Foreign Office acknowledged that the ruling had ""potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications "", and said it was planning to appeal. ""The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years,"" a spokesman said. ""In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened."" 
Friday's historic victory for Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, was the result of a three-year battle through the courts. They had suffered what their lawyers describe as ""unspeakable acts of brutality"" including castration, beatings and severe sexual assaults. A fourth claimant dropped out while a fifth, Susan Ciong'ombe Ngondi, died two years ago, aged 71. 
In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the news from London was relayed to two of the complainants, Nyingi and Mara, by mobile phone. They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a sun-scorched garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and eventually raising their hands to the sky to pray. 
Nyingi, who was detained for about nine years, beaten unconscious and bears the marks from leg manacles, whipping and caning, said: ""For me ... I just wanted the truth to be out. Even the children of my children should know what happened. What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government."" Mara said: ""I'm very happy and my heart is clean."" Asked what she would tell her four children, she said simply: ""I will tell them I won."" 
McCombe said in 2011 that there was ""ample evidence ... that there may have been systematic torture of detainees "". On Friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible, and highlighted the fact that thousands of documents came to light in 2011 after the Foreign Office admitted to a secret archive of colonial-era files. 
During the course of their attempts to have the claims struck out - efforts that the claimants' lawyer, Martyn Day, described as ""morally repugnant"" - the British government's lawyers accepted that all three of the elderly Kenyans were tortured by the colonial authorities. 
Day said: ""The British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured by the British colony and yet they have been hiding behind technical legal defences for three years in order to avoid any legal responsibility. There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to the Yemen, from Cyprus to Palestine, who will be reading this judgment with great care."" 
Among those who are known to have been watching the case closely are a number of veterans of the Eoka insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s. One has already met the Mau Mau claimants' lawyers. Any Cypriot claimants would be able to rely not only on British documentation, but upon the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to public scrutiny. The Red Cross documented hundreds of torture cases in Cyprus, where reporters covering the conflict referred to British interrogators as HMTs - Her Majesty's Torturers. 
There may also be claims from Malaysia, where large numbers of people were detained during the 12-year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948. Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers massacred by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry. Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government, although, as Aden is now part of Yemen, British lawyers may have difficulty making contact with potential clients there.

"He had the tastes of a typical millionaire. He owned a gold and silver Rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. He liked to dabble in modern art. But, although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the Madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of Spanish authorities. 
Gao Ping, who had lived most of his adult life in Spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 Chinese bazaars across the Mediterranean country. But, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from China. 
When police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of EUR100, EUR200 and EUR500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. Around EUR12m was wheeled away in trolleys, the largest ever cash seizure by Spanish police. The gang, with Gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to EUR300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. The government prosecutor said Gao's illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of Spain. Gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial. 
Law enforcement officials have long had concerns about EUR500 notes. Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. The sum of EUR1m in EUR500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in EUR50 notes would require a small suitcase. Cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. A less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis. 
The UK stopped distribution of the EUR500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was ""almost entirely for criminal purposes "". In 2009, Italy's central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. Other countries have limited their own high- denomination notes due to links to organized crime - Canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers. 
In an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered Bank, has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes, including the EUR500, the $100, the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the GBP50. In a report for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for ""bad guys"" pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. Although criminals would switch to smaller- denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said. 
At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, called on the European Central Bank (ECB) to look at whether it ""should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities"". According to Europol, the purple EUR500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one. 
The EUR500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark, the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira. Several European countries favoured high- value banknotes. ""It is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,"" says Pia Huttl, an affiliate fellow at the Bruegel thinktank. ""The preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere."" 
Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. The former president of Germany's constitutional court, Hans-Jurgen Papier, told Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper Bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the EUR500 note - ""hands off my cash "". 
Law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. In one case that has caught the attention of police, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit EUR200,000 of torn and muddy EUR500 notes. In the same week, EUR1.3m in EUR500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. But, a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. ""Our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that, in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,"" says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol's financial intelligence group. ""The search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange."" 
The agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the ""striking anomalies"" in the use of EUR500 notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in Europe. Europol asked Luxembourg's central bank to explain. ""The reply we had from Luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,"" MacLeod says. ""I find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area."" 
This could be changing. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be ""a comfort for criminals"". Other members of the ECB's top team, such as Yves Mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the EUR500 note. But, amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. EU finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore ""appropriate restrictions"" on high-value notes and report back by 1 May 2016.

"Top aides to President Obama on Sunday signaled that some U.S. troops could start coming home from Afghanistan as soon as July 2011, but most would likely remain there for several years.
In appearances on all the major talk shows, Cabinet officials and military advisers clarified the president's position after he walked a political tightrope by announcing he will send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and that some will start coming home in 19 months.
National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones told CNN's State of the Union that the July 2011 start of withdrawal was not a cliff, it's a ramp for beginning to turn over security responsibility to Afghan forces.
Noting the U.S. strategic interests in the region, including nuclear power Pakistan next door, Jones said: We 're going to be in the region for a long time. 
Gen. David Petraeus, the head of U.S. Central Command, said on FOX News Sunday that Obama's strategy does n't trigger a rush to the exits, while Defense Secretary Robert Gates told CBS Face the Nation that there is n't a deadline. 
 What we have is a specific date on which we will begin transferring responsibility for security district by district, province by province in Afghanistan to the Afghans, Gates said.
The challenge has been to meet the need cited by military leaders for more troops and resources to wipe out terrorist networks in Afghanistan and to help the Afghan government overcome the Taliban insurgency, while satisfying the Democratic Party's liberal base, which opposes the deployment of more troops.
Gates explained the rationale for sending more forces on ABC's This Week, saying the Afghan-Pakistani border is the epicenter of extremist jihad. 
 And al Qaeda has close relationships with the Taliban in Afghanistan, and they have very close relationships with the Taliban in Pakistan, Gates continued. The Taliban in Pakistan have been attacking Pakistani civilians, Pakistani government officials, military officials, trying to destabilize the government of Pakistan. 
Any success by the Taliban in either Afghanistan or Pakistan benefits al Qaeda, Gates said, adding that any safe haven on either side of the border creates opportunities for them to recruit, get new funds and do operational planning. 
 And what's more, the Taliban revival in the safe havens in western Pakistan is a lesson to al Qaeda that they can come back, if they are provided the kind of safe haven that the Taliban were, Gates said.
In addition, Gates warned on NBC's Meet the Press that U.S. casualties will probably continue to grow as troops take on Taliban strongholds. However, Gates rejected a comparison to the Soviet Union's decision in 1985 to send more troops to bolster its occupation of Afghanistan, which ended in failure less than two years later.
 The parallel just does n't work, Gates said. The reality is the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. They killed a million Afghans. They made 5 million refugees out of Afghanis. 
In addition, he said, the Soviets acted unilaterally, while the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan involves 42 countries with a mandate from NATO.
In Congress, Republicans generally backed Obama's deployment plan but complained that announcing the start of a withdrawal was a signal to the enemy of a compromised commitment.
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the unsuccessful GOP presidential candidate last year, told NBC's Meet the Press that a strategy must be flexible to succeed, rather than limited by a set timetable.
On FOX News Sunday, Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's second-ranking Democrat, called the July 2011 start of a withdrawal a necessary signal to Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
According to Durbin, Obama's message to Karzai was: We 're not going to make Afghanistan a protectorate of the United States. You have to change your government. You have to show that you are willing to stand up and fight for your own country. 
 I think that message is long overdue, Durbin said.

"London is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in the United Kingdom. The city is quite popular for international tourism because London is home to one of the oldest-standing monarchies in the western hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. They were very excited for their trip because this was their first journey overseas from the United States.
Among the popular sights that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. Big Ben is one of London's most famous monuments. It is a large clock tower located at the northern end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters tall. Unfortunately, Rita and Joanne were only able to view the tower from the outside. The women learned that the tower's interior is undergoing renovations until 2021.
Fortunately, the London Eye, the city's famous Ferris wheel, was open to the public. The London Eye is situated along the southern shores of the Thames River. This attraction stands 135 meters high. It is one of London's most well-known spots for gaining aerial views of the city. Each capsule of the Ferris wheel can hold up to 25 passengers. When their capsule stopped at the top of the Ferris wheel, the women took spectacular panoramic photographs of the beautiful cityscape below.
The last place that Rita and Joanne visited was Buckingham Palace, the home of the Queen of England. The women were impressed by the palace's incredible architecture and historical value. Both Rita and Joanne enjoyed watching the Queen's guards outside the palace. These guards wore red tunic uniforms, shiny black boots, and bearskin hats. Despite the women's attempts to catch the attention of the guards, the guards are specifically trained to avoid distractions. Because of this, the guards ignored the women completely.
Joanne and Rita had an amazing time visiting the city of London, and they are inspired to seek more international travel destinations in the future.",C1
"In the most extensive reshaping of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will name Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, top U.S. officials said Wednesday.
Gen. David Petraeus will be nominated to take over as CIA director, and Lt. Gen. John Allen will succeed Petraeus as head of the U.S-led international military force in Afghanistan, a senior administration official told reporters. In addition, longtime diplomat Ryan Crocker will be nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, the official said.
President Barack Obama will formally announce the changes on Thursday, according to the senior administration official. It is the biggest reshaping of Obama's national security team since he took office in January 2009 and reflects a longstanding plan by Gates to step aside this year.
More changes also are coming. Both Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and FBI Director Robert Mueller are not eligible for renomination for terms that expire this year.
Gates will resign effective June 30, assuming Panetta gets confirmed by Congress in time and is ready to start on July 1, according to an administration official and a congressional aide familiar with phone calls Gates was making to legislators and senior staff members.
Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over at the beginning of September, officials said, which could require an interim CIA director if Panetta moves to the defense secretary's office as planned on July 1.
In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said.
Initial reaction from Congress was positive, with key legislators on intelligence and security issues praising both Panetta and Petraeus as good choices.
 The sum total of these picks is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time, said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. This team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer. I could not be more pleased with these selections. I hope these nominees receive swift approval by the United States Senate. 
Gates was telling legislators and staff members that he recommended Panetta for his job six months ago, and joked that Panetta stopped speaking to him for days for doing so, the officials said. In addition, Gates was saying that Allen was a consensus choice to succeed Petraeus, according to the officials.
It took a meeting with Obama to convince Panetta to accept the job, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Panetta has been happy serving at the CIA, but believes strongly in public service and answering the call from the commander-in-chief, the source said.
Panetta, 72, took over at the CIA in February 2009. He served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997, and was previously the director of the Office of Management and Budget -LRB- OMB -RRB-. The California Democrat served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993.
Before coming to the CIA, he spent 10 years co-directing a public policy institute with his wife, Sylvia.
He was brought in as a relative outsider, without hands-on intelligence experience, to manage an agency that had been shaken by the exposure and criticism of its controversial interrogation and detention program. Panetta's longstanding ties to Congress were seen as a way to restore the administration's relationship with oversight committees. He has been given high marks on both fronts from inside the agency and in Congress.
David Berteau, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Panetta brings several important qualities to the table.
He learned a lot of lessons about defense budgeting during his stint as the head of the OMB, and knows how to deal with a Republican Congress, as he did during the Clinton administration, Berteau said.
Panetta's former congressional district in northern California had a huge defense presence, Berteau said.
Panetta has earned the trust and confidence of Obama as leader of the CIA, and has name recognition, which is important, Berteau said, adding: It's a name Americans recognize. Filling Bob Gatesshoes is really going to be a tough job. 
Berteau said the president's choice of Petraeus to lead the CIA indicates that Obama is interested in his national security views and efforts and it indicates that the president cares about the way all those pieces fit together. 
Earlier this month, Petraeus took a highly unusual step for a military officer when he publicly acknowledged the possibility of being in contention for a presidential appointment.
 It's probably not appropriate for me to comment on whatever might be considered down the road, he told reporters in Kabul when asked about the possible CIA nomination. I 've had discussions, but again, it would n't be appropriate to comment. 
Petraeus, 58, assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- and U.S. Forces Afghanistan on July 4, 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of United States Central Command. He previously commanded multi-national forces in Iraq, leading the so-called surge. During his time commanding the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, he oversaw the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual.
Crocker has served previously as U.S. ambassador to Iraq and to Pakistan, while Allen became deputy commander of U.S. Central Command in July 2008.
Gates is the only Cabinet member from the previous administration to stay on when Obama came into office. President George W. Bush nominated Gates as the nation's 22nd secretary of defense in December 2006 to replace Donald Rumsfeld, one of the architects of the Iraq War who was facing widespread criticism.
Gates did not expect to stay on after Bush's presidency ended. When asked if he would continue under another administration, Gates said in 2008, I learned a long time ago never to say never, so my answer is: The circumstances under which I would do that are inconceivable to me. 
But those circumstances arose. In December 2008, then-President-elect Obama expressed a desire for continuity at the Pentagon, given the ongoing conflicts abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 I spent a long time hoping the question would never be popped, Gates admitted the day after Obama announced his nomination. But, he said, Obama impressed him.
It is unclear who may replace Mueller at the FBI.
Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday did not rule out Mueller staying on short-term when his 10-year term expires in September if a successor has not yet been confirmed. Mueller will leave hard shoes to fill, Holder said.
Holder said he has been discussing potential nominees with White House officials, including Vice President Joe Biden. Holder said he believes that if a nominee is selected by May, the administration should have time to get the new director confirmed by August.
If that timeline slips, however, the Mueller term would end September 4, one week before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Mueller has often remarked that he barely had a chance to find his desk before the 9/11 attacks occurred, and his entire decade was dominated by the fight against al Qaeda and its scattered supporters at home and abroad.

"Israeli troops fired on protesters trying to cross the fortified border between Syria and the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday, with Syrian authorities reporting more than a dozen dead and hundreds wounded.
The protests came on the anniversary of the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately confirm any casualties, though a spokeswoman said that Israeli troops used tear gas and live ammunition on members of an angered mob. 
 We warned them verbally -LRB- and -RRB- with warning shots into the air, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich told CNN. And when these two options failed, we had to open fire selectively into the area, and this actually stopped those Syrians from reaching the Israeli-Syrian fence. 
The Syrian state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 wounded in the protests, which continued past nightfall. Medics could be seen carrying the wounded to vehicles and driving them away from the border.
A spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the violence and urged restraint.
 The events of today and of 15 May on the Golan put the long-held cease-fire in jeopardy. The Secretary-General calls for maximum restraint on all sides and strict observance of international humanitarian law to ensure protection of civilians, he said.
As many as 500 people took part in the demonstration, holding mid-day prayers on the Syrian side of the border, then crouching down behind ramparts that Israel constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago. The number later dropped to about 50, with protesters waving Palestinian and Syrian flags.
Clashes also broke out between Palestinians and Israelis at the Qalandia crossing between Jerusalem and Ramallah in the West Bank on Sunday. At least six Palestinians were injured there, one seriously, by rubber bullets. Israeli forces also fired tear gas, while Palestinians threw stones.
The clashes come three weeks after similar demonstrations marking the 1948 birth of the Jewish state -- a day of mourning for Palestinians, more than 700,000 of whom were displaced from their homes during the fighting that followed. Those protests left at least 12 dead.
Leibovich accused Syria of trying to use the protests to create a diversion from the bloodshed that is taking place inside Syria, where the United Nations says a crackdown against anti-government protests has left more than 1,000 dead.
 There is no question about it, she said. The policemen, the armed Syrian forces are looking back and not doing anything. 
Demonstrators arrived in at least eight buses before the protest began, then came down from a hill known locally as Shouting Hill -- where people shout to family and friends on the other side of the border -- toward the ramparts Israeli forces constructed last month.
Leibovich said Israeli troops were better prepared to deal with the demonstrations than with the May 15 protests, beefing up forces along the frontier and making clear that we would not tolerate any infiltration into the Israeli side.

"Want a job as a music journalist? Here's your chance. We're looking for a new lead reviewer for Hot! Magazine but we're not interviewing for the job. Instead, write a review of your favourite album ever. We want to know why you love it and why you think everyone should listen to it. Convince us and you've got the job!
I'm certainly not alone with my choice of favourite album. In fact, Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA has sold 30 million copies worldwide since its release in 1984. Nearly 30 years later, in 2013, Springsteen performed the complete album in concert to the delight of some of his many die-hard fans.
A fast-paced, foot-tapping rock album, Born in the USA's lyrics nevertheless carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss.
Unlike many other best-selling album artists, Springsteen is still releasing chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game in his late 60s. It doesn't surprise me at all. This is a man who tells us our most fundamental stories about ourselves and, when you listen to Born in the USA, those stories are as relevant today as they ever were.",C1
"During the 1970s, one of the biggest movements occurring in the United States was the fight for equal rights. Many members of American society felt disenfranchised and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers enjoyed a living wage complete with benefits and other advantages, while others struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers during this time period was California farm workers.
 
The farm workers were migrant workers who came into the country mostly without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley. This region in central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket because of its rich soil and high yields. Farm workers tended these fields during the day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's minimum wage, and had no fringe benefits other American workers enjoyed. Cesar Chavez changed all that.
Cesar Chavez, the Arizona-born civil-rights activist and labor leader, became the voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group. Taking the lead from the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez began a series of non-violent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions farm workers had to endure. Many of these workers worked much longer than eight hours a day, and received no overtime pay. Chavez, who was a farm worker himself in the 50s, led marches, and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the working conditions for farm workers and other oppressed workers.
Chavez was highly recognized during his lifetime, and his legacy increased after his death in 1993. He has reached iconic status among the Mexican-American community.",C1
"Report on staff engagement at Girox Foods
Introduction
At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention.
Research methods
This study was conducted with over 500 employees of Girox Foods between March and August 2018, with the aim of understanding their experience and expectations of the workplace. The study covered the 80 branches of Girox Foods located in 20 European countries. In addition to the 500 questionnaires filled out by Girox employees, 120 also participated in ten separate focus groups where participants took part in discussions about their levels of engagement in Girox and their hopes for the future.
Key research findings
The top reason for employee disengagement given by 35 per cent of those surveyed is the lack of challenging work, followed by having too many working hours (34 per cent).
43 per cent of those surveyed said that the top reason for employees quitting their jobs was a lack of recognition, while 31 per cent stated that it was due to bad management.
There was no correlation between salaries and level of employee engagement.
47 per cent stated that their levels of engagement would improve if they felt more ownership of their work. 45 per cent wanted more flexibility both in terms of working hours and locations. 42 per cent were keen to see the company investing more in their career development.
59 per cent felt that their commitment to the company would improve if they were given training opportunities to improve their business skills. 64 per cent rated social and cross-cultural intelligence as the most important skill needed in the workplace.
41 per cent of respondents felt that there should be increased transparency in company communications, as this would lead to increased trust and more informed decision making.
Recommendations
On the basis of these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style. As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations. Managers need to consider a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition of the work they do. Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.",C1
"Just days after giving birth to her second child, Dr. Jane Dimer drove herself home from the hospital to find her then-husband in bed with another woman. He threw Dimer down the stairs, and she never saw him again until court.
Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.
Dimer, now an obstetrician-gynecologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington, had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in Germany for 4 1/2 years until he pushed her out 11 years ago.
 Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time, she said.
Domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44, according to the National Institutes of Health. With the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation Rihanna, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally charged with assaulting her, public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated.
Abuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Those who stay are likely to stop trusting their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and nonromantic relationships.
Victims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice, Crawford said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict, even verbal disputes, at all costs. Some women wo n't trust people easily, if at all, and wo n't be able to handle even normal expressions of anger. Visit CNNHealth.com, your connection to better living
 What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they 're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way, he said. If somebody's still having issues 10 years later, they just have n't worked through it. They have n't healed; they need to do that. 
New research shows that abuse victims feel the impact of violence long after it occurred. A recent study in the Journal of Women's Health found that older African-American women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lifetimes -- whether by a partner or family member -- are at a greater risk of poor mental and physical health status.
 Not just ongoing violence, which everybody thinks about, but even when it's over, there's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we do n't quite understand yet, said Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at Temple University School of Medicine.
It makes sense that abused women would report worse health, given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said.
Other studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse. Adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the past five years have rates of depression 2 1/2 times greater than women who have never been abused, according to a different study of more than 3,000 women. They are also more likely to be socially isolated, said author Amy Bonomi, associate professor at The Ohio State University.
Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1 1/2 times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.
 People like to sort of think that, Well, abuse is just when you have a black eye, you sustain a broken bone, Bonomi said. But we see lots of different effects in other areas, like depression and social isolation, and we 've actually proven that with the data. 
Women who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, but it's unclear how the two are related -- one does n't necessarily cause the other, and there could be other factors involved, Bonomi said.
A 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index. These women also spend up to one-third more than average on health care costs. About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused.
While Paranjape's study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported having poor health, the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse. This indicates that there is something else that makes abused women report feeling unwell, she said.
 When your patient says they do n't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on, she said.
People who have gotten out of a relationship should go through the work of learning what issues set them up in that situation, and reflect on the warning signs, Crawford said.
Experts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support, but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups, because their abusers could discover what they 're saying, Dimer said. Research has also shown that violence escalates in abusive relationships among couples who go to marriage counseling, she said.
Some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said. She herself found healing through advocacy and research on the subject, she said.
Calling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.
 Whether you 're a pop star or somebody that's working front lines -- an employee at a grocery store selling the pop star magazine -- you 're at equal risk for having this, she said.

"Fit in four minutes. It sounds like a headline from a health magazine; an unattainable promise on late-night satellite TV. Then you attempt Dr Izumi Tabata's training protocol - 20 seconds of all-out effort, 10 seconds of rest, repeat eight times - and between sounding like Darth Vader as you desperately suck in oxygen and collapsing in a messy bundle of sweat and defeat, you realize just how wrong you were. 
Tabata has seen it all before. ""They were dead!"" he chuckles as he recalls the first time he inflicted the system that bears his name on his university students in the early 1990s. ""After four minutes' hard exercise they were wiped out. But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. We all were."" 
His research followed extensive monitoring of Japan's speed skating team in the early 1990s when he - along with the team's coach Irisawa Koichi - noticed that short bursts of brutally hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. Tabata set out to show this with a simple experiment. One group of moderately trained students performed an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week. The other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals, four times a week - plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals. 
The results were startling. After six weeks of testing, the group following Tabata's plan - exercising for just 88 minutes a week - had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their VO 2 max, a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. The control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their VO 2 max, but by 10% - and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity. ""We have also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the protocol,"" says Tabata. ""And there is also forthcoming research that shows that it lowers the risk of diabetes in humans, something we have already shown in rats."" 
But there are no half-measures here. You can't go steady on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO! The regimen demands head-down bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints or suchlike. Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? Imagine doing eight of them with only a ten- second break to recover. 
""All-out effort at 170% of your VO 2 max is the criterion of the protocol,"" says Tabata. ""If you feel OK afterwards you've not done it properly. The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. In the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only lasted six or seven."" 
As one commenter on the popular exercise forum T-Nation puts it: ""When done correctly you should meet God. Most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn't even try."" 
Tabata doesn't completely agree. ""Everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them,"" he explains. He says that he will soon publish research showing that doing the programme just twice a week, less than half the volume in the original research, still provides significant health benefits. 
Another soon-to-be-published finding, which Tabata describes as ""rather significant "", shows that the Tabata protocol burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest, due to the effect of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. So while it is used by most people to get fit - or by fit people to get even fitter - it also burns fat. 
It's slightly surprising, therefore, that the plan is still the preserve of the serious athlete and musclehead crowd - although that may change now that Tabata has agreed a deal with Universal Studios that will lead to a network of instructors and a DVD range released towards the end of the year. ""I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and, while I am honoured that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don't realize the intensity you need to work at,"" says Tabata. 
So should we all start incorporating this plan into our fitness regimens? Richard Scrivener, a former Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach at Northampton Saints Rugby Club, says that while the benefits are clear, Tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. ""Runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from skill acquisition and putting in the miles,"" says Scrivener, ""But they could effectively ease off the long runs and reduce the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training. This will unload the skeleton and give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if one is prone to niggles or has a history of injuries - and you would probably therefore get more out of the long runs when you do undertake them."" 
Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week. And the rest of us can build up session by session, week by week, all the time knowing that it will never get easier because every session calls for maximum effort. That's the cruel genius of the protocol: it is unrelenting - and effective.

"When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they made clear their intention: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls' education. 
Nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the United Nations on her 16th birthday on Friday to deliver a defiant riposte. ""They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed,"" she said. 
As 16th birthdays go, it was among the more unusual. Instead of blowing out candles on a cake, Malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the United Nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders. 
She listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, described her as ""our hero, our champion""; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy, Gordon Brown, uttered what he called ""the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala "". 
The event, dubbed Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora, in the troubled Swat valley of Pakistan. She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants. 
By 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence to combat the Taliban's drive against education for girls. By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who put her forward for the International Children's Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history. 
But such dizzying global attention came at a price. Death threats followed her growing recognition, and, on 9 October 2012, following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders, the gunman was dispatched to remove what they called the ""symbol of infidels and obscenity "". 
Multiple operations in Pakistan and the UK followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. She now lives with her family in Birmingham and does what the Taliban tried to stop her doing: goes to school every day. ""I am not against anyone,"" she said in the UN chamber, having taken this day out from the classroom. ""Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group."" 
Malala responded to the violence of the Taliban with her own countervailing force: words against bullets. ""I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him."" 
She spoke confidently, with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas. There was one other unstated allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike Malala, did not survive to tell the tale: Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan. 
""The extremists are afraid of books and pens,"" the teenager continued. ""The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them."" 
She cited the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ""That is why they are blasting schools every day - because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society."" 
And she gave her own opposing interpretation of Islam to the Taliban's. ""They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because of going to school. The terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits. Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. Islam says that it is not only each child's right to get education, rather it is their duty and responsibility."" 
Such ability to articulate what normally remains unarticulated - to give voice to young people normally silenced - has generated its own response. The ""Stand with Malala"" petition, calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures - more than a million having been added shortly after Malala's speech. 
At the start of her speech, Malala said: ""I don't know where to begin my speech. I don't know what people would be expecting me to say."" She need not have worried.

"North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
The State Department has declined to confirm the identity of the citizen, citing privacy issues. But the family of 85-year-old Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, has said he has been detained in North Korea since October 26.
Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, and it has been working through Sweden -- the U.S. protecting power in North Korea -- to obtain information about the American.
 We are working in close coordination with representatives of the Embassy of Sweden to resolve this issue, and they also have requested on a daily basis consular access, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters.
The revelation came the same day that Newman's wife, Lee, pleaded for his release.
 The family feels there has been some dreadful misunderstanding leading to his detention and asks that -LRB- North Korea -RRB- work to settle this issue quickly and to return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious, concerned family, she said in a statement.
Newman, a Korean War veteran and retired financial consultant, was last seen aboard a flight from Pyongyang to Beijing. Just minutes before the plane was to depart, he was removed from the flight by North Korean authorities, the family has said.
 He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since that time, Newman's wife said in the statement.
According to the family, Newman and a traveling companion, Bill Hamrdla, had been on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea.
The family has said Newman suffers from a heart condition and only had enough medication for the trip.
 We have had no word on the state of his health, whether or not the medications sent to him through the Swedish Embassy in North Korea have been delivered or why he was detained, the statement said.
The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with one or two Korean authorities, his son said.
During that meeting, Newman's service record was discussed, Jeff Newman said.
 I understand my dad was a bit bothered, Newman told CNN. But neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was an issue.
The United States this week issued a warning to American citizens against all travel to North Korea, which has become a magnet for adventure travelers after Pyongyang lifted some of its travel restrictions.
Newman was a customer of Juche Travel Services of London, company spokesman David Thompson said in a written statement.
 The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company, Thompson said. Mr. Newman had in place all necessary and valid travel documents to take his tour. We have no information concerning what has occurred to result in the current situation. 
The 10-day private tour, which included the use of a tour guide, was the culmination of months of planning, Newman's wife said.
 The postcards sent to friends while on that trip describe good times, good weather and knowledgeable guides, she said in the statement.
The family's statement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on North Korea to release Americans being held, calling the detentions very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans. 
Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea.
The other one, Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor. The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of hostile acts and attempts to topple the government.
North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman.
Is American man detained in North Korea a bargaining chip ?
Among the possibilities is his military service. He served as an Army infantry officer during the Korean War, which saw North Korea fight South Korea, the United States and the United Nations between 1950 and 1953.
An armistice signed in 1953 ended the three-year war between North Korea and South Korea. The two sides technically remain at war.
It is also possible North Korean authorities mistook him for another Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat.
North Korean authorities are known to routinely run background checks on foreigners, travel agencies warn potential visitors.
The first the decorated combat veteran heard about Newman's detention was in a telephone call from the San Jose Mercury News, which first reported the news of the American's detention.
 I thought it was a coincidence. I did n't think much about it, Merrill Newman of Beaverton, Oregon, told CNN.
Of his service during the war, he only said: I went there, did what I was told and went home, went to college and started a family.... That's what you did in those days. 
How you travel to North Korea
News of the apparent detention came as talks were under way between the United States and China, North Korea's closest ally, about reviving negotiations to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program.
The timing raises questions about whether North Korea plans to use Newman as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, a move the West has previously accused it of doing to try to gain concessions with negotiations.
Newman's detentions bring to at least seven the number of American citizens who have been detained by North Korea, including four who allegedly entered the country illegally, according to the State Department.
Two other U.S. citizens who entered the country on valid visas were arrested for other reasons, and U.S. officials have received reports of other Americans being arbitrarily detained, according to the State Department.
Previous Americans detained in North Korea have been released when high-profile visitors have traveled to the country to plead their case. Most notably, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter went on two separate occasions in 2010.
Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former ambassador to the United Nations, has visited North Korea a number of times over the years, most recently this year to discuss the release of Bae.
Richardson's spokeswoman, Caitlin Kelleher, said he has been in touch with his North Korean contacts regarding Newman's detention.

"Henry Ford was an American inventor who is credited with inventing the automobile assembly line. German automaker, Karl Benz, is credited with inventing the first motor vehicle in the late 1880s, but Ford was the man who made it possible for everyday citizens to own one. Before Ford came up with his assembly line process, cars were built one at a time by hand, which was a very costly and inefficient method of production. Ford's assembly line revolutionized the way cars were built, and his methods are still in use today.
 
In 1886, Benz patented his Motorwagen, which was a four-wheel, two-passenger, self-powered motor coach that was designed to replace the horse and carriage. These vehicles were expertly crafted, but were available to only the wealthiest people of the time. Thanks to Ford, that all changed in 1906. His Ford Motor Company, the first automobile company to use assembly line techniques to build cars. transformed the automobile from an expensive curiosity to a practical tool that could be used to transport people and goods easily and efficiently. His first mass-produced product was the Model T. It remains one of the most sold vehicles ever, and was the first to reach 15 million sales.
Ford's impact on the 20th Century cannot be overstated. At one time it was estimated that nine out of 10 vehicles on American roads were Fords. His cars spurred the American economy like no other single factor. The country's roadways were built in response to the great number of vehicles Ford and subsequent American automakers produced. Additionally, Ford's vehicles created a network of support industries such as parts, repair, and maintenance services. It also caused a revolution in how goods were transported in the country. Henry Ford was a true American icon.",C1
"Officials from the Massachusetts Port Authority issued an apology Wednesday after conducting a fire training exercise at Boston Logan International Airport on the 12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
 The fire department will be training this morning. Smoke on the airfield is part of the training, the airport's Twitter account announced.
In response to negative reactions on social media sites, the port authority, which operates the airport, said in a statement, Massport apologizes for conducting the fire training exercise and understands that it may have offended many of those touched by the events of Sept. 11. 
 It's just dumb, Gov. Deval Patrick said. The timing could not be worse. 
American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 traveled out of Logan and struck the World Trade Center towers in New York City after being hijacked on September 11, 2001.
The terror attack orchestrated by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed 2,977 people in New York City; Washington, DC; and Pennsylvania, in the worst such attack in U.S. history.
Steve MacDonald, spokesman for the Boston Fire Department, told CNN on Wednesday that the department had no involvement and that the airport used its own fire department for the exercise.
 Safety and security is our top priority and constant vigilance and readiness is critical, but the exercise should not have taken place on the anniversary of 9/11, Massport's apology stated. The airport community recognizes the day with moments of silence, a service in the chapel, and a wreath at the 9/11 memorial. 
In an unrelated act of vandalism, police are trying to find out who placed two cardboard cutout images of crashing planes at the 9/11 Memorial in downtown Lafayette, Louisiana, according to CNN affiliate KATC.

"The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go.
A soldier takes a picture Wednesday of the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
Honduran forces also will not enter the Brazilian embassy, where Zelaya has been housed since Monday, de facto President Roberto Micheletti said in an interview with CNN en Espanol.
But these developments do not spare Zelaya, who was ousted in a June 28 coup, from being arrested and facing charges for violating the constitution if he leaves the safe haven of the embassy, Micheletti said.
 President Zelaya should present himself before the tribunals of justice in our country where he has charges against him, Micheletti said.
The de facto president challenged versions of events surrounding Zelaya's return.
Despite local reports citing police officials that authorities turned off the power to the embassy and surrounding area ostensibly to discourage looting, Micheletti said that a congregation of pro-Zelaya protesters at the embassy short-circuited the power themselves.
As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said.
A nationwide curfew was lifted Wednesday, but a security cordon remained in the area around the embassy.
Micheletti said that the police were there because the people inside the embassy requested the protection, and said, We are not impeding the exit nor the entrance of absolutely anybody. 
Zelaya's announced return has re-ignited a stand-off between the two disputed leaders of Honduras. Brazil now finds itself involved because of its embassy.
Brazil wants an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the situation, the official Brazilian news agency reported.
In another development, Micheletti said he is willing to meet anywhere with ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya as long as Zelaya agrees to abide by presidential elections scheduled for November 29. But the de facto leader said in a statement read by his foreign minister Tuesday that his offer to talk with Zelaya does not nullify an arrest warrant issued against the ousted president by the nation's Supreme Court.
 I think that what the whole world should understand about this country is that there is no immunity for anyone -- for anyone, Micheletti told CNN en Espanol. And, no one can be above the law. 
Micheletti's willingness to engage Zelaya seemed to be a reversal of his position. On Tuesday, he had said in an interview with local network Televicentro that Zelaya's sudden appearance would not revive negotiations to have him return to power.
The United States and Brazil have said they support dialogue between the two sides, centered on the San Jose Accord, an agreement negotiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. That deal calls for Zelaya to be restored to power.
The Brazilian request for a Security Council meeting came after the Honduran government isolated the embassy by cutting water, power and phone lines to the building, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly confirmed to reporters Tuesday in Washington.
This was the same action that Micheletti denied Wednesday.
Micheletti said that other nations have not given his government a fair hearing of its position.
 This is what we Hondurans want: to be heard, for them to read our constitution, to read our laws, and to see what happened before June 28, Micheletti said.
The de facto government argues that Zelaya was not removed in a coup, but in a constitutional transfer of power.
Zelaya, a centrist whose politics took a strong turn to the left once in office, was ousted in a June 28 military-backed coup. Despite increasing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, Micheletti has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power and Micheletti thwarted two very public attempts by Zelaya to return to his homeland.
 Yes, we are alone, but we are surviving, Micheletti said. Two months ago, people did n't think we would withstand all this time, but here we are almost three months later. 
Amnesty International issued a statement Wednesday in which the human rights group denounced a sharp rise in police beatings, mass arrests of demonstrators and intimidation of human rights defenders in Honduras since the June coup d'etat and warned that fundamental rights and the rule of law in the Central American nation are in grave jeopardy. 
The organization said police fired tear gas Tuesday at a building housing a prominent human rights organization. Around 100 people, including women and children, were inside, Amnesty International said. Many were there to denounce what they said were police abuse while breaking up the demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy, the rights group said.
 The situation in Honduras can only be described as alarming, said Susan Lee, Americas director at Amnesty International. The attacks against human rights defenders, suspension of news outlets, beating of demonstrators by the police and ever increasing reports of mass arrests indicate that human rights and the rule of law in Honduras are at grave risk. 
It was still not publicly known Wednesday how Zelaya got into the country and he declined to provide details, only telling CNN en Espanol on Tuesday that it was a 15 - to 16-hour trip he took with the help of Hondurans. 
Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report for CNN en Espanol.

"Two-year-old Lakshmi Tatma, an Indian toddler born with four arms and four legs, made her first public appearance Tuesday, a week after surgeons in India successfully removed her additional limbs.
Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference.
Lakshmi, wearing a plaster cast on her legs to keep her feet up and her legs together to help her wounds heal, was carried into a news conference Tuesday as her doctors announced she was being released from intensive care.
 She is coping very well, lead surgeon Dr. Sharan Patil said. She is being carried around by her mother and her father. 
Several of her doctors, all of them smiling, described her recovery over the past week very steady and good progress, one saying she is out of the woods as far as serious medical issues are concerned. Watch the recovering little girl meet the media 
The operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of some 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts.
Lakshmi's extra limbs were part of a conjoined twin which stopped developing in the womb. It had a torso and limbs but no head, and was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis.
Doctors said that without the surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence.
The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.
When Lakshmi was born into her poor, rural Indian family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed she was sacred. As news of her birth spread, locals queued for a blessing from the baby.
Her parents, Shambhu and Poonam Tatma, named the girl after the Hindu goddess of wealth who has four arms. However, they were forced to keep her in hiding after they were approached by men offering money in exchange for putting their daughter in a circus.
The couple, who earn just $1 a day as casual laborers, wanted her to have the operation but were unable to pay for the rare procedure, which had never before been performed in India.
After Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital's foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation.
Planning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.
Many villagers, however, remained opposed to surgery and were planning to erect a temple to Lakshmi, whom they still revere as sacred. E-mail to a friend

"If your view of the world comes from watching the news and reading newspapers, you could be forgiven for lying awake at night worrying about the future. Apparently, rising violence and population rates mean humans are both killing each other in ever larger numbers and being born at rates the world's resources can't sustain. To make matters worse, all the wealth is concentrated on a handful of people in the world's richest countries. People in low-income countries live in poverty while the West gets richer. Depressing, isn't it?
But do the statistics support our negative world view or is the world actually improving?
Let's take global population first. It's around 7 billion now, in line with figures predicted by the UN in 1958. By the year 2100, the same experts predict it will be around 11 billion. But did you know that 11 billion is probably as high as that number will get? The rate of increase will slow down in the second half of this century thanks to falling birth rates today.
Falling birth rates? Yes, that's right.
In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth. These large families produced even more children who survived into adulthood and had their own children. But with the wider availability of contraception in the 1960s, the global average number of babies per woman has declined from six babies per woman to as low as two.
The biggest factor in child mortality is poverty. And while it's still true that only 20 per cent of the world takes about 74 per cent of the world's income, 60 per cent of the world now falls into a middle-income group, with 11.6 per cent - the smallest amount of people in history - still living in conditions of extreme poverty. If the majority of the world's people have money, international aid could realistically achieve the UN target of eradicating poverty by 2030. As poverty goes down, life expectancy goes up, birth rates go down because parents can expect their existing children to survive, and the global population stabilises.
As for news stories that make us think the world is an increasingly violent place, there is cause for some optimism too. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly co-existing more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, though, the statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict, the global murder rate fell slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015.
Of course, none of this means the world is perfect, and whether you personally are affected by war and poverty is often down to the lottery of where you're born. Also, we still face huge problems of our own making, particularly environmental ones like global warming, and wealth and natural resources need to be distributed more fairly. But not all the news is bad news, whatever the TV and newspapers might say.",C1
"Dozens of Roman Catholic bishops in South America say human trafficking has seen alarming growth in the region.
The 60 bishops from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay issued a statement after a meeting in Argentina last week, calling the practice a shameful and outrageous reality and pledging to do more to fight it.
 We warn of the existence of organized mafias that use smaller networks that are present in nearly all of our cities and towns, the statement said.
Learn more at The CNN Freedom Project
Citing reports from global nonprofit groups, the bishops noted that child sex trafficking rings were also operating in the area.
The bishops pledged to raise awareness of the problem, push for legal reforms and assist victims -- noting that within the church there had been an absence of proposals dedicated to attracting young people -LRB- to the church -RRB-, and the absence of a more decisive and broad response to the problem -LRB- of human trafficking -RRB-. 
Such an approach is not surprising, said Sergio Rubin, a journalist who has written extensively about the Catholic Church in Argentina.
 The church is assuming its role, and they believe that they must work a lot more in the formation of religious values, Rubin said.
Mario Ganora, a lawyer who works with La Alameda, an Argentinian nonprofit that helps victims of human trafficking, said the increase in human trafficking was connected to an increase in drug consumption.
 How ?... The women who are used for sex trafficking are also used for the delivery of drugs, he said.
According to official data from Argentina's Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, 176 people were rescued from human trafficking networks in Argentina in April, a higher number than the entire previous trimester.

"A proposal for a digital version of the university newspaper
Introduction
This proposal intends to outline how a digital version of the university newspaper, The Scallion, could function and aims to show that an online paper is viable for the future of the newspaper. It draws on the views of 3,000 students surveyed in May.
Background
The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience.
Current problems
The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.
Proposed solution
It is proposed that the newspaper could shift to an online format. An overwhelming majority (95 per cent) of survey respondents were 'keen' or 'very keen' on this.
The key benefits would be:
Lower costs. Electronic publication is much cheaper than printing, and the website would require minimal maintenance. Although there are considerable initial costs of developing a website, these would be offset over time.
Improved accessibility. Students unable to collect a copy and those with visual impairments would be able to read the paper online.
Eco-friendliness. A website would reduce paper usage and produce no litter.
Digital media experience. For student journalists, gaining experience in running a web-based news site would be invaluable for any job which involves digital communication.
Drawbacks
One issue is information management. The site would have to comply with data protection and privacy laws. Advice should be sought from the IT department.
Another drawback may be personal preference. Twenty-five per cent of survey respondents liked having a physical paper to flick through in a cafe. However, as this is a minority view, I would suggest that the benefits of the online paper outweigh the inconvenience on this issue.
Conclusion
The results of the consultation suggest that moving the paper online is the best option given that it would reduce costs, be more environmentally-friendly and reach a larger audience. A change to a digital format is therefore recommended to maintain the benefits of the newspaper while addressing its current difficulties.

"Work on the world's largest solar bridge has started in central London.
The new solar roof spanning Blackfriars Railway Bridge above the River Thames will cover more than 6,000 square meters when finished, according to developers.
Over 4,400 individual photovoltaic panels are expected to produce around 900,000 kilowatt hours of electricity every year, providing the station with half of its energy needs, according to Solar Century, the UK company installing the solar roof.
Annual CO2 emissions are also expected to be reduced by more than 500 tons.
 It's fantastic to see this project finally come to fruition. Blackfriars Bridge is an ideal location for solar, Derry Newman, chief executive of Solar Century, said in a statement.
 For people to see that solar power is working is a vital step towards a clean energy future, he added.
Built in 1886, the railway bridge is being transformed as part of an upgrade by Network Rail -- the owner and operator of rail infrastructure in the UK -- to the existing Blackfriars station.
 The Victorian rail bridge at Blackfriars is part of our railway history. Constructed in the age of steam, we 're bringing it bang up to date with 21st century solar technology to create an iconic station for the city, Lindsay Vamplew, Network Rail's project director for Blackfriars said in a statement.
In addition to the solar panels -LRB- manufactured by the SANYO Electric Co. Ltd -RRB-, the station will also include rain-harvesting systems and sun pipes for natural lighting.
The solar roof and the new station are due to be completed by the summer of 2012.

Subject: Process issues in the team
 
Dear Steve,
Since you requested in our recent line management meeting for me to inform you of any issues, I'm writing to tell you about a recent incident. Last week, after experiencing some difficulties with the order processing system, tensions arose in the team and a confrontation occurred between two team members.
I've outlined what led to this incident below:
1. There was a system update that we weren't expecting last week. The update slightly changed the interface menu. Everything is still there but people have said it's not easy to find some of the menu items they're looking for.
2. There seems to have been a period of time after the update that new entries weren't being saved. This led to some work being lost. We worked overtime to catch up on everything and all orders have been processed. But as a consequence there was a general feeling of pressure and tiredness in the team.
As a result of these challenging circumstances there was some tension, leading to a disagreement between Johann and Maria. Johann lost his temper and made some inappropriate remarks to Maria.
I met with them both in order to reflect on and resolve the conflict. Johann has apologised for his behaviour and he realises that Maria could have chosen to start disciplinary proceedings. They have worked together on a plan to improve communication and therefore alleviate tensions within the team.
I've also asked our colleagues in the IT department to run a training session for us all on how to best use the system in light of the recent software upgrades.
There's no specific action for you to take, but I felt it important that you're kept in the loop.
I'll keep you posted.
Regards,
Sanjit",C1
"Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited.
Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.
Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civilian and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of simple-living and hard struggle, as Chairman Mao decreed. The real reason: Lin Biao, then defense minister and Mao's anointed successor, had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt.
China's achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags. The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live. The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center.
It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic. The Chinese people have stood up ! he declared in a shrill Hunanese accent. For decades, the whole nation followed Mao loyally. He emphasized political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry. In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear.
Mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing. He pushed sweeping socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results. During two political campaigns in the late 1950s, over 550,000 rightist intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned. The Great Leap Forward led to widespread famine and the deaths of an estimated 30 million Chinese.
In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution. There, he rallied hundreds of thousands of young Chinese -- the radical Red Guards -- who lionized him like a demi-god. To rebel is justified ! they proclaimed. They rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere. For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise. Perhaps the only factor that kept the country from total collapse was the people's incomparable resilience and their ability to chi ku -LRB- eat bitterness, or bear hardship -RRB-.
Mao's reign is also credited for positive changes. He banned child brides and polygamy, built Beijing's first subway line and started a space program with China's first satellite launch. In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- in the United Nations.
Still, for three decades under Mao, China tried to break out of its backwardness and isolation but only met modest success.
Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square. Take an audiovisual tour of Mao's hometown 
Soon enough, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the new paramount leader. Deng overturned most of Mao's policies and embarked upon reforming the economy and opening up the country to the outside world.
His quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, propelled by his pragmatic policies to entice foreign investments and build China's private sector.
Just south of Tiananmen, one landmark stands as a symbol of Deng's bold open-door policy. In the early 1980s, the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in Beijing, just a stone's throw away from Mao's mausoleum. Today, the fast food chain still does brisk business, with a large portrait of founder Colonel Sanders hanging on the three-story building.
Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy. Old Guards and conservatives in and outside the communist party accepted Deng's reform policies, but with a great deal of misgiving.
The backlash came to a boil in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy, and more reform. After six weeks of heady demonstrations, the Tiananmen movement was brutally suppressed. See landmark moments in China's 60 years 
China has returned to world prominence through a 20-year economic boom, the speed and breadth of which is unparalleled in the history of mankind. China went from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world. The People's Liberation Army, no longer a junkyard army, has emerged as a formidable military power capable of launching a human being into space and shooting down satellites. Take a look inside China's space program 
The People's Republic of China marks its 60th anniversary on Thursday with 300,000 participants and 60 floats to highlight the country's achievements in various sectors of the society and economy. See anniversary preparations in photos 
A military parade will feature goose-stepping troops marching down the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Modern military hardware -- tanks, armed personnel carriers, missiles, helicopters and fighter jets, all made in China -- will be on display. Fireworks will cap the festivities. See how China has changed over 60 years 
But pomp and pageantry aside, China's phenomenal economic growth over the decades has triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, endemic corruption, rising criminality, environmental degradation and social malaise. Millions of Chinese live on less than $1 a day, and social tension sometimes boil over into violent clashes.
Chinese president Hu Jintao is pushing to promote democracy in the party, curb corruption and seek a harmonious society. To build a well-off society for 1.3 billion people and a democratic, civilized, harmonious and modernized country, he recently told a communist party meeting, China must firmly push reform and opening up and stick to its own path.

Like the cutting-edge CCTV tower intended to formally open this year but did n't after a celebratory fireworks display went awry and caused a fire, China's great achievements stand side by side with daunting challenges.

"What do you need to map a billion stars ? A billion-pixel camera certainly helps.
Scientists hope to glean more clues about the origin and evolution of the universe, and in particular our own galaxy, after a camera of this incredible scale -- fitted to the Gaia space telescope -- was launched Thursday.
Gaia, which lifted off from French Guiana, has been tasked with mapping the Milky Way in greater detail than ever before.
Designed and built by Astrium for the European Space Agency -LRB- ESA -RRB-, the makers say the telescope is so sensitive that it could measure a person's thumbnail from the Moon, or to put it another way, detect the width of a human hair from 1,000 km -LRB- 620 miles -RRB- away.
The mission's aim is to build a three-dimensional picture of our galaxy, measuring precise distances to a billion stars. Even this is a small fraction of the Milky Way, as astronomers believe there are at least 100 billion stars in our galaxy.
Tens of billions like Earth, study says
Astrium says Gaia is also expected to log a million quasars beyond the Milky Way, and a quarter of a million objects in our own solar system, including comets and asteroids.
 It can do it with incredible accuracy. It's the biggest camera ever put into space, said Ralph Cordey, head of science and exploration at Astrium.
He said the spacecraft cost 400 million euros -LRB- $549 million -RRB- to build, but the total cost of the mission would come to 740 million euros -LRB- $1.02 billion -RRB- when the expense of the launch and running the mission for its projected five-year lifetime are included.
If successful, Gaia will add to the knowledge gained from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which is still in operation, and ESA's Hipparcos satellite, which gathered data until 1993.
Hubble spots azure planet where it may rain glass
The value of putting a billion-pixel camera into space has been championed by Robert Massey from the UK's Royal Astronomical Society.
 Gaia is an amazingly ambitious mission, he said.
 Until now astronomers have relied on very indirect methods to gauge the distance to all but the nearest stars, meaning that the foundation on which we build a map of the universe is surprisingly weak.
 Building on the work of the pioneering Hipparcos satellite that mapped the stellar neighbourhood in the 1990s, Gaia will be used to carry out work analogous to the cartographers who surveyed the Earth in the 19th and 20th centuries, building up the first accurate charts of the cosmos and helping us better understand the structure, history and fate of the galaxy we live in. 
One of Gaia's objectives is to help in the hunt for exoplanets -- new worlds beyond our own solar system.
NASA's Kepler mission has so far confirmed the existence of 167 exoplanets with hundreds more being investigated, but Cordey anticipates Gaia will likely discover thousands of new planets, while further missions will be able to uncover more detail about them.
In a recent interview with CNN, George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic -- the company planning to take tourists into space -- said he thought that within a lifetime it would be possible to detect seasons on far-off worlds.
He may have not have too long to wait, as Astrium is already working on design concepts to examine exoplanet atmospheres -- which may provide signs of seasonal variations.
 We are designing missions that could probably do that very thing -- it's not science fiction, said Cordey.

"Such is the lot of the modern-day chemist: you wait ages for a new element to turn up and then four come along at once. Discovered by researchers in Japan, Russia and the US, the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. The new elements, all spectacularly short-lived and highly radioactive, complete the periodic table's seventh row and render science textbooks around the world out of date. 
The US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global organization that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 December, 2015 after poring over studies dating back to 2004. The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the clunky Latin- based placeholders - ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium - which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. The atomic number is the number of protons found in an element's atomic nucleus. 
IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan. The decision means Japan becomes the first Asian country to name an element. Under IUPAC rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist. 
When elements 114 and 116 were assigned formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the Flerov Lab at Dubna's Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US, where the elements were discovered. Kosuke Morita, who led the research at RIKEN, said his team now planned to ""look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond."" Jan Reedijk, president of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of IUPAC, said: ""The chemistry community is eager to see its most cherished table finally being completed down to the seventh row."" 
The Japanese team is believed to be considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, where the element was found. ""They will have been thinking about it for a while already,"" said Polly Arnold, professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University. ""This is painstaking work. All this trying to understand Mother Nature helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. If we understand it better, hopefully we can do better at dealing with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. It also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations."" 
Along with new names, the scientists must propose two-letter symbols for the elements. When IUPAC has received the researchers' suggestions, they will be put up for public review for five months. That allows scientists and others to raise any objections. In 1996, the symbol Cp was proposed for copernicium, or element 112, but it was swapped to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance. 
To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. Ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals, while ununseptium could be a metalloid - a material bearing some metallic properties. The fourth element, ununoctium, may be a noble gas, like other group-18 elements, helium, neon and argon. It is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made. 
Paul Karol, chair of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements, said: ""For now, most of the successes will be used by nuclear theorists to improve their understanding of the structure and stability of these very heavy nuclei as experimenters seek the alleged but highly probable 'island of stability' at or near element 120 or perhaps 126. It might be that those elements have long enough lifetimes for their detailed chemistry to be explored. Practical applications of the new elements, if any, are a long way off because of the difficulty in synthesis.""  ",C1
"The customer next to you in the queue looks innocent enough. But, instead of a shopping list, you notice she's carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. She's been timing the progression of the queue on her phone ... and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse? The odds are you've just spotted a mystery shopper. 
There are approximately 50,000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the UK, according to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association, and, as more and more spending takes place online, the demand for mystery shoppers is growing. ""Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they can't get online,"" says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books. ""Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience."" 
""We assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,"" says Jill Spencer of mystery shopping company ABa. ""Each day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting five to ten stores, plus another hour or two filing detailed reports on every aspect of their visit."" For that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to GBP155 a day. They are also reimbursed for their petrol and hotel stays, and compensated for their car depreciation (the shoppers can be expected to drive as many as 20,000 miles a year). Meanwhile, video mystery shoppers, who film their visits with a hidden camera planted in a buttonhole or handbag, can earn even more - around GBP300 a day. 
Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. ""I'm typically given between GBP5 and GBP20 to spend at each store, to assess the service I receive at the till,"" says Laura, a 50-year-old mystery shopper from Devon, who has been paid to visit around 7,000 shops since 2001. The purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check. ""I'm always given a scenario, such as buying something from a specific department or a new product range, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want - and keep it."" 
Like most full-time mystery shoppers, Laura is self-employed, taking jobs from ABa and other mystery shopping companies as and when they come up. Her income is typically GBP30,000 to GBP40,000 a year and that doesn't include all the freebies she gets on the job. ""With the perks, it's enough to live on. But I don't do it because I love shopping. In fact, I hate shopping now. When I'm not working, it pains me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk."" She does, however, find it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. ""I know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? Some of the retailers I shop at win awards for customer service and I think that is down to us mystery shoppers. I feel I'm not just doing a service to my company; I'm doing a service to all shoppers everywhere."" 
Sadly, regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like Laura's are few and far between. In fact, competition is so fierce, she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family don't know who she works for (Laura is not her real name). 
It's estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation. ""Where once you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,"" say Val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. ""I worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what I considered to be an acceptable rate."" 
Nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers. ""Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,"" says Boydell. ""At the most, we'll pay GBP15 to GBP25 plus reimbursement for, say, a meal for two or a hotel stay. We don't directly employ any shoppers so we don't have to pay them the minimum wage."" 
""I'd go on a cruise for nothing,"" says Laura. ""But I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. I won't touch those jobs anymore."" There are plenty of people, however, that would. Hannah, a 41-year-old City lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses. As a prestigious ""platinum diner"", she is regularly hand-picked by the Mystery Dining Company to carry out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying GBP200 meals at Michelin-starred Mayfair restaurants, five-star hospitality at Ascot and overnight stays at boutique hotels. 
But there's no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. Hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to specific interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or ""subtly"" describe. Trickiest of all, she must memorize all these details while eating her meal - unable, of course, to openly write anything down. 
""There's lots to remember and sometimes it can detract from the experience. You're expected to give feedback while it's fresh, so I've had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. It's a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.""

"As colourful fish were swimming past him off the Greek coast, Cathal Redmond was convinced he had taken some great photos with his first underwater camera. But, when he looked at the results on dry land, the images were brown and murky. Having taken the pictures while holding his breath underwater, he blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots. All he needed, the industrial designer thought, was a little more time to properly capture the fish in their natural environment. 
He vowed to make the little extra time needed a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive - a refillable air storage device, held in the mouth, that lets users swim underwater for two minutes. It is aimed at bridging the gap between snorkelling, with its limited scope, and scuba diving, which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater but at the cost of using cumbersome and expensive gear. The prototype of the invention - which is still in the initial stages of testing individual parts - looks like a cross between a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle. 
""I wanted to enable people to do more. So, rather than just get in underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted to do a little bit more than they were able to do,"" says Redmond, 27. In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe fish in their natural environment. Less enjoyable, however, were the fins, the weight belt, the wetsuit, air tank, mask and all the other equipment. 
""I was very keenly aware of the fact that I had about 50kg strapped to me and getting into the water was quite foreign when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface. It was a very surreal experience,"" he says. ""The real problem is that it is very limiting as to what you can do. Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it. You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you - you can't be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in. Planning is a very big part of it. It demands a lot. There is a lot of relearning required."" 
It was during a final-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive. The device has two main parts. When above the surface, the unit uses a fan to suck in air via a vent in the mouthpiece. The air, accelerated around the motor-driven turbine, is compressed through a series of valves and stored in the attached tank, which has a display light that flashes green when it is full. When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the user dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece. 
That display, which is in the user's eyeline, then acts as a health bar turning from green to red when the air runs low. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be refilled. ""When you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff, the batteries and the electronics and the membranes for the scuba delivery, the big trick was to be able to get it small enough so that it would be able to be held through the teeth and out of the mouth,"" Redmond says. 
The electrics are shielded from the water in the casing and are recharged using inductive power transfer - a system using an electromagnetic field, similar to the pads which can wirelessly charge mobile phones, so that there is no need for exposed wires. 
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel. He likens it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater. ""It is an extension of the body's capacity to store air,"" he says. The prototype, made from high-density foam, aluminium and silicone, has been tested in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes' worth of air into the unit and that the design can be effectively held in the diver's mouth. What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, fully submerged for two minutes. But, with enough testing, Redmond is confident he can get a fully functioning device that will not endanger swimmers underwater. 
Redmond recently came runner-up for the International James Dyson Award, which will give him GBP5,000 to further develop the project. Early indications are that the device would be priced at GBP280, he says, and it is likely to weigh anywhere from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed. 
To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a minor improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make all the difference underwater. The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says. ""Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,"" he says.

"One of the most influential figures in human history is Charles Darwin. Darwin has been called the father of evolution for his work in evolutionary science. In the United States, Darwin has become the symbol for atheists in the country as his theory of evolution smacks in the face of creationism. His theory claims that all of earth's species have descended from their ancestors, and that they have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. It also claims that every species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his landmark book On the Origin of Species in 1859.
 
His book was met with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public, but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain mass acceptance. One of his most significant studies came when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British sea vessel, to the Galapagos Islands. The islands have been long isolated from the South American mainland, and provided him with a unique insight on the process of evolution.
While sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and mainland species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also found that the same species had differences from island to island. To Darwin it was clear that the reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands showed Darwin the evolution process in the making.
Darwin has many critics from religious circles. A very famous caricature of Darwin depicting him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans evolved from ape-like creatures. He spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism, which includes people who feel his theories are rooted in the scientific method as opposed to religious dogma.",C1

"""There are certainly MOOC junkies, who take them for no other reason than they're free and they like hanging out,"" grins Dr Ben Brabon of Edgehill University, whose massive open online course in vampire fiction is one of only two accredited MOOCs currently on offer in the UK. Brabon isn't denigrating people who enrol on MOOC courses: he's simply pointing out the motivation that prompts certain individuals to sign up. When a course is open entry - MOOCs have no enrolment criteria and no fees to pay - then participants are going to behave very differently from students in a traditional higher education setting. 
MOOCs are the newest big thing in the quest to enable higher education for all. A great deal of venture capital money is being invested in the emerging online platforms, which enable the delivery of increasingly sophisticated and interactive course content to participants who can number in the hundreds to the tens of thousands. For these investors, the Holy Grail is to find a business model for MOOCs that will make them profitable - so far, courses have depended on universities being prepared to bankroll their star lecturers' curriculum design and online teaching time. Mining the data captured about how, why and when millions of participants opt to sign up, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and drop out of the course may be one way of getting a return on the investment. 
Part of the dilemma around which future direction MOOCs will take, however, is that nobody can yet define whom exactly they are meant to benefit. Universities keen to entice fee- paying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online? Students in developing countries hungry for access to first-world universities? Employees wishing to develop their professional knowledge? People lacking qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education? Or hobby learners, who are keen to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest? 
Though they may be popular to start off with, MOOCs have dire completion rates, observes Brabon. For his vampire fiction course, that meant 1,000 enrolments and 31 completions. ""And almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level,"" he says. ""So the MOOCs trend may not be opening up HE to sectors of the population it hasn't reached to date."" 
""Learning online is a different thing, needs quite advanced learning skills,"" confirms David Kernohan, progamme manager for eLearning Innovation at Jisc, a charity that champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research. ""With MOOCs, there's very little support available: the student is dropped in and tends not to get any individual attention. This is, instead, approximated by peer support such as online discussion forums."" While this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, it does, he says, suggest that MOOCs could be ""a really good tool for continuing education."" 
At a time when the number of part-time students has fallen sharply as the price of a degree rises, could this type of open and free-to-access course provide a new path to university-level education? Could an entire degree be taught via MOOCs? ""I don't think that's how MOOCs work,"" says Brabon. Instead, he suggests ""a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a MOOC; also, perhaps, using MOOCs to create a global degree, with students taking courses from across the world, might be possible."" 
But that's a little way into the future: for now, no prospective employer will care much if you come waving your MOOC completion certificate, without any quality assurance on either the course content or its assessment standards. Accreditation is therefore now the central challenge that MOOCs must grapple with to gain credibility with academics and employers, says Brabon, who is on a Quality Assurance Agency working group, aiming to develop an agreed approach to standards and marking. 
There is idealism around the concept of MOOCs bringing the best of first-world teaching to students in less developed countries. But there's cynicism, too, with the suggestion that universities could use MOOCs to advertise their on-campus wares to greater numbers of lucrative - though certainly not always wealthy - students from outside the EU. 
Mike Sharples, chair of Educational Technology, doesn't buy into that cynicism. MOOCs are viewed primarily as a way to showcase and share universities' best teaching talent, as well as encouraging interaction and soliciting feedback from students around the world, he says. He believes that recruiting international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of running MOOCs - though they could certainly be a very canny marketing move, as he observes that ""if 20,000 people sign up to a MOOC - well, you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a master's."" 
Meanwhile, any politically correct qualms about whether UK academic institutions are patronizing developing countries by exporting small snippets of elitist education may soon be entirely irrelevant, warns Matthew Poyiadgi, managing director at Pearson VUE. ""I believe we may get to a situation in the future where universities maybe won't have a choice, and where British universities are saying, 'if we don't have a presence in China, then we'll get left behind,'"" he says. 
""In South America, China, countries in Africa, there is a huge appetite for learning and some of the world's best courses are being offered online,"" adds Sharples. ""If people are genuinely fascinated by learning, then why not? The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to consume and study MOOCs, but also to create them.""

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was hospitalized Sunday after doctors discovered a blood clot during a follow-up exam related to a concussion she suffered this month, her spokesman said.
She is expected to remain at New York Presbyterian Hospital for the next 48 hours so doctors can monitor her condition and treat her with anti-coagulants, said Philippe Reines, deputy assistant secretary of state.
 Her doctors will continue to assess her condition, including other issues associated with her concussion, Reines said. They will determine if any further action is required. 
Reines did not specify where the clot was discovered.
Clinton, 65, was suffering from a stomach virus earlier this month when she fainted due to dehydration, causing the concussion.
Clinton spent the holidays with her family last week after working from home.
She was scheduled to return to work at the State Department this week after being sidelined for the past three weeks. Her illness forced her to bow out of testifying December 20 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns appeared in her place.
The medical setback comes as Clinton is wrapping up her busy tenure as secretary of state, during which she has logged more than 400 travel days and nearly a million miles. She plans to step down from the post if and when Sen. John Kerry -- President Barack Obama's choice to replace her -- is confirmed by the Senate.

"The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. On the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African country's ""Ouallywood"" film industry, it has played host to big-budget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones. 
Now, the trading city, nicknamed the ""door of the desert"", is the location for another blockbuster - a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco's electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco's ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower. 
When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down. 
The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the world's deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanity's power needs for a whole year. The challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required. 
As engineers put the finishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. The 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east. 
When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Morocco's capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW. 
Morocco's Environment Minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn project to make her country's deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said. 
""We are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,"" el-Haite told the Guardian. ""We also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought, 'Why not?'"" 
Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco's renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each. 
""We are very proud of this project,"" el-Haite said. ""I think it is the most important solar plant in the world."" 
Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a 'heat transfer solution' (HTF) that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy- generating turbines. 
The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds. 
Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours - opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region. 
""The biggest challenge we faced was being able to finish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve,"" said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director. 
But, even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. ""We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,"" says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Societe d'Investissements Energetiques, the national renewable energy investment firm. But he says the project's ultimate impact will go far wider - even as far as the Middle East. ""The ultimate objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca."" 
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal. 
""We believe that it's possible to export energy to Europe but, first, we would have to build the interconnectors which don't yet exist,"" said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. ""Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and, then, start exporting."" 
Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member country's power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020. 
In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. This could, one day, include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. Officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North African region. ""We are at the avante-garde of solar,"" el-Kadiri says. 
About $9bn has been invested in the Noor Complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and backed by Moroccan government guarantees. Undisclosed energy subsidies from Morocco's unelected ruler, King Mohammed VI, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers. 
One month before launch, over a thousand, mostly Moroccan, workers are still racing to fix electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines. They bustle past in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts against a backdrop of the Atlas Mountains. Harnesses with hammers and gloves strapped to their belts swing by their sides. Ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp. 
For Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from Meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action. 
""We've done the construction and, now, we will see how these projects look when they start,"" she says. ""It is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance."" 
A global audience will be watching with interest.

"More than one million British workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts, new figures reveal, suggesting that British business is using the controversial employment terms far more widely than previously thought. 
The figure - derived from a poll of more than 1,000 employers conducted by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) - prompted renewed calls for the government to launch a full inquiry into the use of the contracts, after a week in which a string of organizations - from retail chains to Buckingham Palace - have faced criticism for hiring staff but offering no guarantee of work and pay each week. Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before seeking additional work elsewhere. The CIPD found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time, typically working 30 hours or more a week. One-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations. 
The latest numbers also call into question the accuracy of official data on the topic. The Office for National Statistics has increased its estimate of the number of UK zero-hours workers by 25%, to around 250,000. 
Peter Cheese, the chief executive of the CIPD, said: ""There does need to be a closer look at what is meant by a zero-hours contract, the different forms that they take and clearer guidance on what good and bad practice in their use looks like. And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages in practice for businesses and employees."" 
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts. The retailer's use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers. 
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff - 80% of its workforce - on the terms. 
Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, added: ""If it's true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce - this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority. 
""The new estimate underlines the urgent need for a deep and thorough review of zero-hours by the government, which takes into account not only the scale of the problem but the effect these contracts have on workers' employment rights, earning capacity and personal well-being."" 
Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts as a way to evade their responsibilities and cut staff benefits. 
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: ""The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice. They may give flexibility to a few, but the balance of power favours the employers and makes it hard for workers to complain."" 
Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are worked out, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice. They should be entitled to holiday pay in line with the number of hours they work, but do not qualify for sick pay. 
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it offered the same pay and benefits to those workers, pro rata, as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be on a more flexible arrangement. 
""We believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather- dependent,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Our properties have told us it's important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this."" 
Politician Chuka Umunna said the contracts should be the exception to the rule. ""While some employees welcome the flexibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,"" he said. 
Some people have argued that the flexibility of zero-hours contracts may have allowed the UK to avoid higher levels of unemployment during the economic downturn, while the CIPD research suggests that only 16% of those on zero-hours contracts report that their employer frequently fails to provide them with sufficient hours each week. 
The institute's figures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector. 
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).

"Wales will become the first country in the UK where people will be presumed to have consented for their organs to be donated unless they opt out. 
The Welsh Assembly has voted to adopt the opt-out policy, which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection. 
The final stage of a bill to adopt a system of presumed consent was passed by 43 votes to eight, with two abstentions, in spite of objections from religious groups on moral grounds and concerns that the scheme could add to the distress of grieving families. 
""This is a huge day for Wales, for devolution and, most importantly, for the 226 people in Wales waiting for an organ transplant,"" said the Welsh Health Minister, Mark Drakeford. 
""I am proud that Wales will be the first nation in the UK to take this step. As a society, we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant. 
""Family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved one's wishes. 
""The family of the potential donor has a major role to play in organ donation. The aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, relatives or friends may object to consent being deemed based on what they know about the views of the deceased. 
""When family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted, they usually agree to participate in the donation process. The new law will work by clarifying people's wishes around the issue of organ donation and, in turn, increase the rate of consent to donation. 
""Today is a landmark day for Wales and I expect the rest of the UK to be watching with great interest when the legislation is implemented in 2015."" 
The issue is controversial, with opponents worried that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and their family being overruled. But ministers insist there will be safeguards. 
Inevitably, some people will not get around to registering their opposition. In response to concerns, the government recently announced that families would play a bigger role. 
Relatives are to have a ""clear right of objection"", giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor. 
Wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs. ""We have the enduring problem of not having enough organs for people who need them,"" said Drakeford. ""About one person every week dies in Wales while on a waiting list. We have been working to improve the rate of organ donation and have had some success, but we're looking to take the next step forward. 
""Around a third of the Welsh population is on the organ donor register, but well over two- thirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors. That other third is people who don't get round to putting their names down. We're hoping to make inroads into that."" 
The new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in Wales for at least the year before his or her death. Donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in Wales but to anybody in the UK. 
Doctors are delighted at the move. The British Medical Association has long campaigned for an opt-out system because of its concern over the growing number of people needing transplants - a result of medical progress in transplantation. 
The number of young donors dropped substantially when seatbelt legislation came in. Big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card, with a good deal of success. Hospitals have also brought in improved systems for coordinating transplants, including the crucial discussions with relatives when there is no indication of the wishes of the deceased. But the increase in numbers of organs harvested is still not enough. 
Some religious groups, on the other hand, strongly oppose the scheme, arguing that it would cause further distress to bereaved relatives. Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council have expressed reservations, while the Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, said that ""donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity. If organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection, that's not an expression of love. It's more a medical use of a body.""

"Male bosses are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs - a disparity that means men enjoy salary top-ups of GBP141,500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime. 
The figures, released by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of GBP6,442 in 2012 compared with GBP3,029 for women. In the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of GBP36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with GBP63,700 awarded to male directors. 
The latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in British business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality. Ann Francke, the CMI's chief executive, said: ""It's time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda. 
""This is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards. ""In solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. What are we waiting for?"" Dr Ruth Sealy, a senior research fellow at Cranfield School of Management, added: ""It is not surprising. Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion. As to what should be done about it, these things should be made more transparent."" 
While statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating Britain's pay gap, which the government says is closing but still sees full-time male employees earn 10% more than women. 
Maria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, said: ""The CMI figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that, in the world of work, women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level. ""Changes in the workplace are happening and it's good that the pay gap is closing - but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace. 
""The government is playing its part: we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal, given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think, Act, Report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women. ""We've also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities, by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees."" 
Large companies such as Tesco, BT, Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think, Act, Report. The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence, having risen from 54 participants in November 2012. However, the CMI's data did provide some evidence to support Miller's contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink, decreasing from an average of GBP10,060 in 2012 to GBP8,502 in the CMI's most recent figures. However, the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples - which both polled around 40,000 managers - as they are not identical. 
A sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers' earnings are rising faster than women's for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined. 
At the most senior level, male directors' earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.

"With a star-studded client list that includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lindsay Lohan, Julia Roberts and Michelle Pfeiffer, Trelise Cooper is an internationally known fashion designer.
Starting out with a boutique store in Auckland, New Zealand, during the mid-1980s, Cooper's ascent onto the fashion stage -- and the front covers of Vogue and Marie Claire -- is made more remarkable by the fact that she never received any formal training as either a designer or seamstress.
Instead, Cooper relied on her self-confessed obsession for detail, as well as a natural eye for fashion. I was born a fashion designer she says, and soon after she set up shop, her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of pattern and intricate stitching.
Cooper took up the Fusion Journey challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital. Although it's a city she had been to on business many times before, she says that she 'd never allowed herself the time to study its traditional dress in earnest.
See more Fusion Journeys
There she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant, brightly colored traditions of Indian dress-making.
In her own words, Cooper retraces the footsteps of her Fusion Journey.
Trelise Cooper: I absolutely adore the historical aspect of clothing. My ranges are full of influences from 19th-century French, English, even American vintage styles. So it's no surprise I have always enjoyed combing through flea markets in small towns and finding rare antique gems to steal some inspiration.
I 'm also obsessed with detail, so when I find a Victorian gown or a 50s bridal slip that I like, then it's important for me to be able to emulate the exact stitching, embroidery or beading used at the time. In the West, unfortunately, most of our expert hand-stitching traditions have been lost -- the skills have not been passed on and the seamstress geniuses from the couture houses of Europe have not been replaced.
That is why I 'm often traveling to India. It's one of the very best places in the world to find that expertise still thriving. From one village to the next you find whole families, generations, that have their own specialties of stitch work.
Honestly, I can give them any old historical piece that I 've found and they will either take it away and recreate it almost perfectly, or they 'll say hmmm... I do n't know this stitching, but I know a place nearby that does. It's a fashion designer's dream !
So in one sense, I 've been fusing my clothes with Indian influences for a while. However, I think this was the first time I 've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations.
I just love the color and the vibrancy that is India. New Delhi is exciting and chaotic and noisy and dusty and smoky and hot. Everything is so full of intense color and I realized that, on a subconscious level at least, I 've been influenced by Indian style... In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world ?
Walking through the streets, you see color combinations that you 'd never imagine would work. I recall a beautiful woman wearing a sari in bright, radiant pink mixed with a lime green print. I mean, lime and pink ! It sounds garish, but on her, with the quality of the dye and the way the colors had been combined it looked absolutely stunning.
We made our way to a shop that I can only describe as a treasure trove of fabrics and other goodies. This was the place to find all the accessories, textiles, ribbons, bows, buttons, and beads that I could take back to my studio in Auckland to use as inspiration for the final creations.
There were ideas there, old and new, that I 'd never thought about. Already I could envisage opportunities to use all sorts of different laces and braids, detailed examples of hand stitching, with some other antique dresses we 'd picked up from a local supplier.
Much as I love them personally, I do n't sell things like saris -- and I never would -- it's not a style that would appeal to the tastes of my particular customers. However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins.
I worked on the new line for many months, and these are the elements I hope I managed to incorporate into them. I think they 've added an opulence, a romance. But I 'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it.
The garment takes them on a journey, and so my journey with the garment has finished.

"David Mitchell, a regular contender for the Man Booker literary prize, is used to his novels being picked over by the critics. So, it's something of a relief, says the British author, that his latest work - completed at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway - won't be seen by anyone until 2114. 
Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Paterson's Future Library project, for which 1,000 trees were planted in 2014 in Oslo's Nordmarka forest. Starting with Margaret Atwood, who handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015, each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed. 
Each author - their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while she is alive - will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above Oslo, where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony. 
""It's a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles, which affirms we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years,"" said Mitchell. ""Everything is telling us that we're doomed but the Future Library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures. It brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization."" 
Mitchell said he found writing the book ""quite liberating because I won't be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad ... But, I'm sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer. So, it better be good. What a historic fool of epochal proportions I'd look if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn't any good."" 
Usually, says Mitchell, who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his novels number9dream and Cloud Atlas, he ""polishes and polishes"" his writing. ""Actually, I over-polish. But, this was very different - I wrote up to the wire. So, the first two-thirds were polished and the final third I didn't have time. And, it was a liberation."" 
Future Library creator, Paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages, asked the writers to tackle ""the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions"". Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time, during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Paterson's 1,000 trees are planted. The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu but, other than admitting that ""it's somewhat more substantial a thing than I was expecting"", the author would say nothing. 
Handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the foot-high shoots of 1,000 pine trees, Mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworth's A slumber did my spirit seal. Its ending, ""Rolled round in earth's diurnal course / With rocks, and stones, and trees"", felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Library's manuscripts. 
""How vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations. Yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say: 'Nice one' or 'God, I loved the bit where she did that and he did this... '"" Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library. 
His manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside Atwood's in a wood-lined room in Oslo's new public library, which will open in 2019. Watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, ""as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river"".

"Four positive books about the world
Factfulness - Hans Rosling with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Ronnlund
In Factfulness, Professor Hans Rosling, along with two collaborators, asks simple questions about the world. Questions like 'How many girls finish school?' and 'What percentage of the world's population is poor?' It turns out the majority of us get the answers to these questions completely wrong. Why does this happen? Factfulness sets out to explain why, showing that there are several instincts humans have that distort our perspective.
For example, most people divide the world into US and THEM. In addition, we often believe that things are getting worse. And we are consuming large amounts of media that use a sales model based on making us afraid.
But according to the authors, the world isn't as bad as we think. Yes, there are real concerns. But we should adopt a mindset of factfulness - only carrying opinions that are supported by strong facts. This book is not concerned with the underlying reasons for poverty or progress, or what should be done about these issues. It focuses on our instinctive biases, offering practical advice to help us see the good as well as the bad in the world.
 
Enlightenment Now - Steven Pinker
Are things getting worse every day? Is progress an impossible goal? In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at the big picture of human progress and finds good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives.
Pinker asks us to stop paying so much attention to negative headlines and news that declares the end of the world. Instead, he shows us some carefully selected data. In 75 surprising graphs, we see that safety, peace, knowledge and health are getting better all over the world. When the evidence does not support his argument, however, he dismisses it. Economic inequality, he claims, is not really a problem, because it is not actually that important for human well-being. One cannot help wondering how many people actually living in poverty would agree.
The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  
 
The Rational Optimist - Matt Ridley
For more than two hundred years the pessimists have been winning the public debate. They tell us that things are getting worse. But in fact, life is getting better. Income, food availability and lifespan are rising; disease, violence and child mortality are falling. These trends are happening all around the world. Africa is slowly coming out of poverty, just as Asia did before. The internet, mobile phones and worldwide trade are making the lives of millions of people much better.
Best-selling author Matt Ridley doesn't only explain how things are getting better; he gives us reasons why as well. He shows us how human culture evolves in a positive direction thanks to the exchange of ideas and specialisation. This bold book looks at the entirety of human history - from the Stone Age to the 21st century - and changes the notion that it's all going downhill. The glass really is half-full.
 
The Great Surge - Steven Radelet
The majority of people believe that developing countries are in a terrible situation: suffering from incredible poverty, governed by dictators and with little hope for any meaningful change. But, surprisingly, this is far from the truth. The reality is that a great transformation is occurring. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and come out of poverty. Additionally, six million fewer children die every year from disease, millions more girls are in school and millions of people have access to clean water.
This is happening across developing countries around the world. The end of the Cold War, the development of new technologies and brave new leadership have helped to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people in poor countries.
The Great Surge describes how all of this is happening and, more importantly, it shows us how we can accelerate the process.",C1

A cursory glance at the Central Bank Directory shows just 12 of the world's 160 central banks had female governors last year. That's about 6 %. Such figures would not be acceptable on the board of your average listed firm.
Last year 15 % of directors at FTSE 100 companies were women while the EU is pushing for boards to raise that quota to 40 % by the end of the decade.

Yellen is no ordinary women or economist. She is an extraordinarily experienced, trusted pair of hands who faces a formidable task ahead in trying to wean world markets off five years of basically free money.
But in elevating her to its helm, the Fed joins a woefully short list of national banks with female governors that includes not exactly influential countries like Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic and Samoa.
Though her appointment still has to be approved Yellen's promotion will make her arguably the second most powerful person in the United States.
If women can take on a mantle as big as that, surely it's time they had more of a say in the clubby world of monetary policy.

"A suspected leader of the Juarez drug cartel told authorities he had ordered the deaths of about 1,500 people, a Mexican federal police official said Sunday.
Federal police detailed accusations against Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, known as El Diego, a day after authorities announced his capture. He was one of the country's most wanted criminals, with officials offering a reward of 15 million pesos -LRB- $1.3 million -RRB- for his arrest.
Collaboration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration led to Acosta's detention, said Eduardo Pequeno, head of the Mexican federal police anti-drug unit.
Acosta is accused of being a leader of the drug gang known as La Linea, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, Mexican authorities have said.
Pequeno told reporters that Acosta said he ordered the killings of about 1,500 people, mostly in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua's capital. 
An investigation points to Acosta as the mastermind behind the March 2010 killing of three people connected with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Pequeno said.
More recently, Acosta ordered operatives to hang banners with threatening messages directed at the DEA and other U.S. authorities, Pequeno said.
Juarez, Mexico's most violent city, shares a border with El Paso, Texas.
Pequeno also accused Acosta of having connections with some of the border city's most notorious violence over the past two years, including the 2010 killing of a state prosecutor, a car bombing outside a police station and a massacre at a house party that killed 15 people -- most of them students with no ties to organized crime.
Acosta told authorities the targets of his criminal organization included police, government officials, rival drug gangs and civilians, Pequeno told reporters.
Earlier this month, the U.S. consulate in Juarez issued a statement warning American citizens to remain vigilant based on information it had received that cartels may target the consulate or entry points on the U.S.-Mexico border.
The northwestern Mexican state of Chihuahua, which contains the namesake capital city as well as Juarez, has been a hotbed for drug-related violence.
The federal government has been targeting cartelsoperations, and especially its leaders, in an ongoing battle.
Mexican authorities have arrested several others they accuse of being connected to the slayings of three people connected with the consulate last year.
The shootings occurred March 13, 2010, when consulate employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, were gunned down as they left a birthday party in their white SUV.
Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle.

"Unraveling the complex back stories of the more than 200 pardons issued by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour is revealing serious questions about how pardon review decisions were carried out.
But perhaps no pardon is as confounding as the case of Harry Bostick. The retired Internal Revenue Service investigator's pardon has been called heinous by critics of Barbour.
 Someone did n't do their homework on this case, said Democratic state Rep. Steve Holland.
When Barbour pardoned Bostick in January, the convicted DUI felon was sitting in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell for violating the terms of a previous DUI sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in October that ended in the tragic death of 18-year-old Charity Smith. Who's at fault in that accident has yet to be determined.
The teenage girl from Okolona, Mississippi, had big dreams of saving money and going to college to pursue a business degree. The young woman's death and the controversy surrounding the case have devastated Linda Smith, Charity's mother.
 She should still be here with me. She should still be here with me. This should not have happened, Linda Smith told CNN during an emotional two-hour interview.
Bostick was given a full pardon for a felony drunken driving offense dating from March 2009. That offense was Bostick's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year.
The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour have issued statements saying they did n't know Bostick had another DUI arrest in October. It came after his pardon case had already been reviewed.
Oxford Police Sgt. Hildon Sessums arrested Bostick twice over a span of a year for DUI.
 Right before I put the cuffs on him he said, Do n't do this to me.And my comment to that usually is, you did it to yourself, Sessums told CNN as he recounted details of the two arrests.
For the third DUI, Bostick had been sentenced in March 2010 to a year of house arrest and four years in Mississippi's drug court program, an intense drug-and-alcohol-abuse treatment program with strict guidelines that convicted felons like Bostick must follow.
Bostick was still going through the drug court program when he started applying for a pardon last summer. High-profile friends wrote letters to Barbour touting what they called Bostick's genuine lifestyle change.
The letters detail what friends described as Bostick's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a freakish house fire and after Bostick's divorce, according to pardon and parole documents obtained by CNN.
One letter said Bostick no longer drinks alcohol and has turned his life around. 
 Harry Bostick has led a tragic life. A life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him. He can now be a positive factor in many lives, wrote retired U.S. attorney Jim Greenlee.
On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of the Bostick case to Barbour. The board recommended Bostick for a full pardon with a divided 3-2 vote.
About a week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car.
Charity Smith was killed and her older sister suffered serious injuries.
Bostick still has not been indicted by a grand jury in that crash. Because his third DUI was pardoned, a conviction in the latest DUI case would technically be his third offense, but that would still make it a felony in Mississippi.
The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour are at a loss to explain how Bostick's pardon could have unfolded the way it did. State officials say there is not a mechanism in place to alert them of situations like this.
A Department of Corrections spokeswoman referred all questions about the case to the Mississippi Parole Board.
Bostickspardon application packet sent from the Parole Board to the governor's office is filled with references to the expedited investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bostick's crime, meaning his third DUI from 2009.
According to a state prison official, the expedited rush was a result of a flood of pardon applications as the clock was counting down toward the end of Haley Barbour's final term as governor.
Barbour refused CNN's request for an interview but his spokeswoman, Laura Hipp, issued a statement.
 In reviewing Mr. Bostick's case, Gov. Barbour took the Parole Board's recommendation into consideration, and he was n't aware of the subsequent charges, she said.
Shannon Warnock, chairwoman of the Mississippi Parole Board, issued a statement saying: I can say that Mr. Bostick's application was supported by testimonials from trustworthy and outstanding members of the community. While the reported circumstances of that arrest are troubling, our system of justice does regard everyone as innocent until proved guilty. 
Linda Smith, Charity's mother, worries her teenage daughter's death has been forgotten in all of this. She struggles to understand how state officials could not have known that the man involved in her daughter's violent crash was the same Harry Bostick who had petitioned for a pardon.
 She was a person. She was n't just some name on a piece of paper. A beautiful person, said Linda Smith.
Her days now are often spent weeping over her daughter's death.
She cried throughout most of her interview with CNN as she showed photographs of the beautiful girl with big dreams.
Linda Smith described her daughter as an artist with a big heart, and she proudly talked about the powerful emotions she feels holding a collection of her daughter's paintings.
One of the paintings was a gift from Charity Smith to her mother. Instead of signing the painting, Charity left her handprint on the back.
But perhaps the most poignant painting was of swirling blues and purples and oranges that reads Life is Short. 
The girl with the artist's heart is now mourned by her mother with a broken heart.

"It could be the best thing since Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio in the pre-internet 1990s - a cheap light that draws free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene-fuelled lamps in Africa and India.
But when British designer, Patrick Hunt, went down the conventional route of bank or venture capital finance to get his invention kickstarted commercially, he hit a problem. ""We tried to get funding to make it happen, but it's slow and complex and it's unproven and nobody wants to take a risk,"" he said.
So he tried crowdfunding on a US website, Indiegogo, which had recently opened up in the UK. Within five days, he had hit his target and raised GBP36,200. So popular was his campaign at the end of 2012 to entice donations from the public that within 40 days he had raised a colossal GBP400,000.
The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks. The weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light.
Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by delivering 1,000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of units.
He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for finance. Another new site is InvestingZone, which matches wealthy individuals with start-up entrepreneurs.
Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer ""perks"" for different levels of donation - those helping to fund Hunt's innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off but also got their own light.
For Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo, the ""gravity light"" is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneur's idea. ""It is the first time that finance has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about 'How do I get access to the decision makers in that bank?' or 'Who do I know in that venture capital outfit?' This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to validateyour idea and fund it.
""Even ideas that aren't deemed worthy to get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasn't a good idea and getting smarter faster,"" she says.
Ringelmann, who is based in the US, started her career as a Wall Street analyst. In 2008, she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money.
The site was originally focused on the film business and launched at the Sundance Film Festival that year.
Five years on and it is raising about $2m a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages. In December 2012, it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold this side of the Atlantic and says Britain is its third biggest market. International activity is up 41% since December.
There is no shortage of competitors, be it Kickstarter, Seedrs or Funding Circle, but, unlike rivals, says Ringelmann, Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign. No project is deemed too wacky.
The site levies a 4% fee for successful campaigns. For those that fail to raise their target amount, users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a 9% fee.
A British woman, Lauren Pears, raised GBP100,000 to open a ""cat cafe"" in London through the site.
Known as Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium, it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can ""come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book and a cat"".
""We've seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture guys say, 'Great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be a gadget that no one cares about,'"" said Ringelmann.
""The entrepreneurs do an Indiegogo campaign - they don't even actually launch the project, but the campaign itself is enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this. 
""It allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new revenue streams, get vital feedback,"" says Ringelmann. 
With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise finance, Ringelmann has fine-tuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur. 
""Ideas are a dime a dozen. It's all about the execution and, if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you, then you are not the right person to execute that idea. It's all about confidence to move fast and to learn,"" she says. 
For Ringelmann, the expansion into Europe and a deal with a web transaction provider, which will allow payments to be made through local card services like Maestro in the UK and Carte Bleue in France, as well as PayPal, are part of a dream to democratize finance. More than 7,000 campaigns for finance are live on the site. 
While crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown, it has limited appeal to big-bucks investors, who don't settle for anything less than a stake in a promising business. That could start to change in the UK with the launch of InvestingZone.

"It's not over in Steubenville, Ohio.
Although a judge has found two Steubenville teenagers guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showcased jaw-dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover-up -- Ohio's attorney general said Monday it's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged.
 I think the Steubenville community needs really two things. One is to get this over with, Attorney General Mike DeWine said in a nod to frustration the continued investigation is likely to cause in the city -- a small, down-on-its-luck Ohio River mill town that's been the focus of intense criticism and media coverage for months.
 But the other is to believe that justice has been done, that we have left no stone unturned and that anyone who is criminally liable has been brought to justice, he said.
Healing process after rape never ends
The victim's mother told CNN that the verdicts are the start of a new beginning for my daughter. But she added, We need to stress the importance of helping those in need and to stand up for what is right. 
 We hope that from this something good can arise, she said. I feel I have an opportunity to bring an awareness to others, possibly change the mentality of a youth or help a parent to have more of an awareness to where their children are and what they are doing. The adults need to take responsibility and guide these children. 
But the emotions inflamed by the case echoed past Sunday's verdict, with sheriff's deputies and state investigators arresting two teenage girls Monday for threatening the victim over Twitter. The girls -- one 15, one 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a juvenile lockup Monday night, awaiting an appearance before a judge Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said.
Grand jury
DeWine said state investigators have examined tens of thousands of text messages, images and videos and talked to 56 witnesses -- from teenagers who attended the parties to assistant football coaches and the high school principal.
But 16 people who may know something about what happened that August night have refused to talk, he said.
 I have reached the conclusion that this investigation can not be completed -- that we can not bring finality to this matter -- without the convening of a grand jury, he said in a statement Sunday.
The grand jury will begin meeting around April 15 and could take a number of days to complete its work, DeWine said.
 And I should point out that the convening of a grand jury, of course, does not necessarily mean that indictments will be returned or that charges will be filed, he said.
 A grand jury is an investigative tool that is uniquely suited to ensure fairness and to complete this investigation, DeWine said in the Sunday statement. And this community needs assurance that no stone has been left unturned in our search for the truth. 
Guilty verdicts
DeWine's announcement of the grand jury came shortly after Judge Thomas Lipps found Trent Mays, 17, and Ma lik Richmond, 16, guilty of rape. Lipps, who was hearing the case without a jury, also found Mays guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor.
Authorities accused Mays and Richmond of putting their fingers in the girl's vagina while she was too drunk to consent, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. The incident took place during a series of alcohol-fueled end-of-summer parties in August.
Some of the abuse was documented in photographs shown in court and in texts read aloud during testimony, including one text in which a state forensics investigator testified Mays wrote, I should have raped since everyone thinks I did. 
Trial focuses on text messages
Lipps sentenced Mays to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility. Richmond received a minimum of one year. Juvenile authorities could decide to keep both in custody until they turn 21.
Richmond's father, Nathaniel Richmond, said he still believed his son was innocent even though he apologized in the courtroom. 
 The evidence they had against Ma lik was minimal, he told CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight.  Ma lik was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. I know my son is not a rapist, even though he has been convicted of rape. 
Both Mays and Richmond must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders, Lipps ruled. Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, said his client would appeal in an attempt to avoid that designation.
Meanwhile, the victim and her family remain under guard after the threats were posted online, Abdalla told CNN.
 She continues to be a victim and be victimized... over and over, he said. And that's what's sad. 
One of the tweets that led to Monday's arrests warned that if the poster saw the victim, it's gone be a homicide. Another threatened a beating.
The girl accused of tweeting the death threat turned herself in after learning that investigators were looking for her, the sheriff said. Nevertheless, They 're going to have to answer to it, he said.
 We 're dealing with kids, again, Abdalla said. But the attorney general had just left the building -- the judge was still in the building -- when I received messages that there's death threats already against the victim. 
No charges had been announced against the suspects Monday night, but There's no question they 're going to prosecute. 
 I hope this sends a warning, he said. And I can assure you, we 've been monitoring Twitter for 24 hours and continue to. If there's anybody else there crosses a line and makes a death threat, they 're going to have to face the consequences. 
Internet outrage
The case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville uncovered some of the materials posted to social media sites.
The blogger, Alexandria Goddard, wrote pointedly about the possibility that the teenagers had been given preferential treatment because they played on the town's highly regarded football team. Police have denied that claim.
Later, the loosely organized hacker group Anonymous got involved, posting a lengthy video in which another teenager -- who has not been charged -- made joking references to the rape.
The ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight.
Teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on Ohio town
Broader problem
Acknowledging the town's frustration, DeWine said Monday that it would be a mistake to focus on one small Ohio community, to think something unique in its culture is behind the incident.
 I 'm afraid people are going to walk away and say this was all about Steubenville, DeWine said. It's not. It's a cultural problem. 
 I 'll guarantee that there are crimes very similar to this that occur every Friday night and every Saturday night in communities across this country where you have people, particularly young people, who are drinking too much and a girl is taken advantage of, and a girl is raped, he said.
Such incidents stem from a larger social problem -- a rampant lack of respect and human decency, he said.
 One of the lessons of life is we have to take care of each other, and we have to try to help people and we have to do what's right. DeWine said. And there were precious few people that night that were doing what was right. 
Teens treated girl like a toy,prosecutor says

"The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year.
But now the real work begins for each of us who took to the streets in protest. How do we channel the energy of those demonstrations into real solutions for our communities ?
I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools.
I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girlsschools. And so I accepted under one condition: that the principals of the district's boysschools attend as well. Because if there's one thing I 'm certain of it's that all the candlelight vigils, passion and protests will be in vain if we do n't figure out how to make men and boys part of this growing movement to transform gender relations in my country.
For more than a decade I 've worked for the poverty-fighting group CARE as a community educator on health and gender issues. I 've seen how the deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in cycle of poverty. But along the way, I 've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives.
The fact is most people want what is best for their loved ones. Aggressive behavior toward women is n't innate. It's learned and can be unlearned. When prompted to reflect on their attitudes towards women's education, sharing domestic tasks, having girl children, and even violence, the boys and men I work with every day can and do change.
Often it starts with something simple, like the laundry.
I think of Ram, a man I worked with in the village of Pavaiya Viran. A husband and father with a macho job -- he drills underground pumps -- Ram attended sessions where he was given a chance to analyze gender roles in his life. He understood that men and boys are under pressure to express power and that when they feel weak or frustrated, their gut reaction is often to demonstrate power, even if that means violent or abusive behavior.
Ram eventually adopted a new outlook; that truly strong men do n't show power, they show care. Let the other men laugh at me for cooking and washing clothes, he told me. Why should my wife alone do all things ? 
Now I 'm not saying men doing laundry is the solution. But each time he folds the linens, Ram shows his children he respects his wife and treats her as an equal, not someone subservient.
And so I kept thinking of Ram as I gathered with the group of 53 principals from boys and girls schools earlier this month. We addressed the importance of installing security cameras at school gates, assuring a woman driver or conductor is on every school bus, and having clean, working toilets at schools so girls and boys are not forced to go outside to relieve themselves. This was all necessary. But it felt like we were playing defense. Only when the educators were forced to hold a mirror up to their own lives did it feel like we were playing offense, too.
Many acknowledged that it's their duty as parents and community leaders to lead the next generation by example. One principal realized he 'd never even considered doing household chores, not as a boy or, now, as a husband and a father. Another vowed to make gender equity a required part of parent-teacher conferences. By the end of the session, every man and woman in the room was thinking about changing not only others but also him or herself.
We have a long way to go, and not just in India. A World Health Organization global survey found that 59 % of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62 % of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30 % of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced. The problem is not confined to the developing world either. Nearly one in five women in the United States has been raped or has experienced attempted rape.
Even so, I 'm confident that the Indian people can demonstrate to the world that we 're not powerless in the face of some global epidemic. We can change. That starts by treating this moment not as some global airing of our dirty laundry but rather a national awakening to the reality that all of us -- girls and boys, women and men -- must do our part in cleaning it.

"Edward Dolman is Christie's first chief executive officer to have been a specialist, who understands the pressure and the nature of valuing art. Part of his mission is attracting other highly motivated specialists into their business.
A Christie's employee stands beside a painting at Christie's auction house in London on July 4.
Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College from 1971-1978, before studying History of Art at Southampton University.
He later completed a degree at the Study Centre for Fine and Decorative Arts, which had a close relationship with the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Not being of blue-blood birth, he joined Christie's because of the link with Christie's South Kensington, starting out as a porter in the furniture department.
After a year he assumed the role of specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything from European to Chinese furniture in the high-volume saleroom over the next 10 years.
Meanwhile he became an auctioneer, doing a number of off-site sales at country estates and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle market of furniture.
At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington began to do great sales. Finally in 1995, he decided he wanted to become a manager and took a course at the Institute of Directors in the Mall to learn the language of business and the motivation of people.
Dolman was subsequently made Managing Director of Christie's Amsterdam, applying new techniques and marketing to enhance interest in high-quality art.
Twenty months later he returned to Christie's London on King Street as the Commercial Director to run Christie's Europe. As he attempted to develop new categories to win business, he was made Managing Director.
In 1999 Dolman moved to New York as the International Managing Director and later as Chief Executive. Together with Christie's International Management Group, they developed an intensive five-year business plan, and Dolman took over from Christopher Davidge, as approved by Francois Pinault.

"As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words ""daily mile"", they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school field. For three-and-a-half years, all pupils at St Ninian's Primary have walked or run a mile each day. They do so at random times during the day, apparently happily, and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK, none of the children at the school are overweight. 
The daily mile has done so much to improve these children's fitness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that scores of nursery and primary schools across Britain are following suit and getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park. 
Elaine Wyllie, headteacher of St Ninian's, said: ""I get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. The thought of children across the country running every day because of something we've done is phenomenal."" 
One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or five, according to figures from the Health & Social Care Information Centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least fit they have ever been. Primary schools have therefore been quick to note the benefits of the daily mile. It has been introduced in schools in London, Gateshead, Wales and other parts of Scotland, while others are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-6 academic year. In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile. 
""It's a common-sense approach to children's fitness, which is free and easy. The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldn't sustain it. They come back in bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look. It's joyous to see,"" said Wyllie. At St Ninian's, teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the school's playing field for their daily mile whenever it best suits that day's timetable. Only ice or very heavy rain stop them. 
The extent of the benefits have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional benefits of the daily mile. Dr Colin Moran, who is leading the study, said: ""The children at St Ninian's don't seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence about the benefits but there aren't any scientific facts yet."" St Ninian's pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that has yet to start the scheme. 
Kevin Clelland, a primary school teacher from Leeds, visited St Ninian's before convincing his colleagues it was a great idea. He said: ""It's such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. We're really committed to improving the fitness of our pupils beyond the two-hour statutory PE that we are expected to deliver."" His school is now constructing a track. 
Active Cheshire, a strategic body for sports and fitness in Cheshire and Warrington, is taking a group of senior figures from the local authority up to Scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. The hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in the region if a pilot is successful. 
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, the UK's leading not-for-profit health body for physical activity, said: ""All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. It's fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile be established, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve children's fitness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young people's lives. We know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life."" 
The Scottish government is also supportive. A spokesperson said: ""Learning in PE is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. We are pleased to see so many Scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.""

"Protests broke out Friday throughout Northern Ireland against a decision by Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag year-round.
 Most of the protests were peaceful, although disruption was caused to the road network in Belfast and across the country, police said in a statement.
One of the most serious incidents occurred at O'Neil's Road in Newtownabbey, where about 100 Protestant rioters -- many of them teenagers -- threw concrete blocks, paving slabs, bricks, planks of wood, gasoline bombs and Molotov cocktails at police.
They targeted about 30 armored police vehicles and as many as 100 police officers clad in riot gear. At least one officer appeared injured. His head bowed, the officer was helped away by comrades.
Amid rain and temperatures just above freezing, police brought in two water cannon, deploying one of them to push back the rioters. Police were trying to gain control of a main highway.

In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said. Thirty-three gasoline bombs were thrown at police during the demonstrations, after which all the roads were reopened.
The eruptions occurred after two nights of calm that followed five consecutive nights of rioting.
Belfast has been at the center of a wave of protests prompted by the City Council's December 3 decision to limit the flying of the flag to 18 days per year.
The disorder has resulted in more than 100 arrests and left 66 officers injured.
The flag was raised Wednesday for the first time since the controversial vote to mark the birthday of Prince William's wife, Catherine. It was lowered at the end of the day.
The leaders of the two main unionist political parties met Thursday to discuss concerns within the unionist community.
Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year.
The British flag has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists and Irish nationalists, who want Northern Ireland to join the Irish republic.
The Belfast City Council vote followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police injured.
The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming Northern Ireland.
Police: Extremist group orchestrating violencein Belfast over Union Jack
In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. 
The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants.
Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.

"Your manager stops you and says she needs to have a word about your performance in the recent project. You worry about it all weekend, wondering what you might have done wrong. When you step into her office on Monday morning she begins by praising you for the good work you've done on the project, and you wonder if this is the obligatory praise that starts off the typical 'feedback sandwich'. You know how the feedback sandwich goes: say something nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again.
In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance. Below are three tips to help you make positive feedback count.
1. Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback
When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.
2. Cultivate a 'growth mindset'
Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done - praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies - we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents.
3. Create a culture of offering positive feedback
Make giving positive feedback part of your team/department/company culture. Don't just wait for special moments like appraisals to give feedback. Offer informal positive feedback when making small talk or when walking down a corridor. Feedback doesn't have to only come from the higher ranks either. Encourage peer feedback among team members and colleagues and actively ask them for positive comments on each other's performances on tasks. 
It might take time to counter the effects of an environment where there is a cynical view of positive feedback, but in the long run, by embracing positive feedback, you can not only enhance working performance but also enrich the quality of life in the workplace. ",C1
"In a dry and dusty soccer field the boys shrieked and screamed as kids in the midst of a highly competitive soccer game often do.
A neighborhood resident pointed towards another three boys on their bikes off to the side watching.
 See where they are ? That is where the cars would pull up, he told me. They would drag a man out and execute him. Some days it was more than one. 
Just a few years ago, this same soccer field was an Al Qaeda killing ground where, like clockwork every day right before evening prayers, executions would take place, and young boys -- the same ages as those now playing soccer in front of us -- would gather to watch the macabre event, seemingly immune to the horrors they were witnessing.
That was in February, when we were in Iraq filming stories for the 10-year anniversary of the start of the Iraq War. In April I found out that a couple of the boys we filmed were killed in a bombing down the road. The bomb -- containing 2 kilograms of highly explosive material -- was hidden in a plastic bag, placed outside of a three-story building that had a popular ice cream parlor on the first floor. The boys were there.
This is the tragic norm of Iraq that people are forced to live with. Violence few understand, fear that permeates every aspect of life, where even a simple action like taking children to eat ice cream can result in death.
This past year has seen a marked increase in attacks, especially coordinated simultaneous strikes, a trademark of ISI -- the Islamic State of Iraq -- an umbrella organization that includes al Qaeda in Iraq.
Baghdad is a maze of blast walls and checkpoints, with Iraqi security forces beefing up security but hardly accomplishing anything more than creating ever-more frustrating traffic jams. The government touts instances when it has managed to diffuse bombs, but the harsh reality is that they simply can not stem the violence.
July was the deadliest month in Iraq in the last five years since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to the U.N., 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month.
And on Saturday bombings spanning from Nassiriya in the south, to Baghdad, to Mosul in the north claimed dozens of lives and wounded nearly two hundred more. It was Eid, the three day holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
The explosions mostly went off in predominantly Shiite areas -- at coffee shops, markets and bus stops.
 Where are the security forces ? a man at one of the bomb sites asked angrily. If you -- Prime Minister Maliki -- can not deal with security, let someone else ! 
Anger and frustration among Iraqis is heartbreakingly palpable.
The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility in a statement, saying that the violence was intended to be a message to the animals of Rawafdh Shiiteand their government. 
Al Qaeda in Iraq -LRB- AQI -RRB- was once described by the U.S. military before it withdrew from Iraq in 2011 as being on the run. But that clearly is no longer the case.
To start with, Iraq security forces were never capable of containing the security gains of the U.S.-military era.
AQI and other Sunni extremist groups have capitalized on the predominantly Shiite-led government's failure to bring Sunnis into the political fold. Iraq's Sunni population maintains that it is being systematically targeted by government forces and grows more alienated and disenfranchised by the day. And Iraq remains a nation where violence and politics go hand in hand.
AQI has also expanded its operations into Syria under the umbrella of Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant -LRB- Syria -RRB-. Its head, who goes by the pseudonym Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or Abu Dua'a, among others, is believed to be mostly operating out of Syria.
But al Qaeda's resurgence and its operations are just one part of the messy and vicious patchwork of forces that govern this part of the world at the expense of the civilian population sucked into an existential battle that started millennia ago.
Those forces include the ongoing regional struggle pitting Shiite Iran against Sunni Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- regional powerhouse who have found proxy battlefields in Syria and Iraq -- along with Russia and America.
The fates of Iraq and Syria are growing more intertwined by the day, and it is the civilians always who continue to be victims of this lethal web of dynamics over which they have little control.

"An Alaska judge has denied Bristol Palin's request that her court fight with ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston over custody of their son be kept private to avoid a media circus. 
The daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is seeking full custody of 1-year-old Tripp, contending that Johnston is too immature to be a responsible father and that his mother's felony drug conviction makes her a danger to the child.
Bristol Palin filed for full custody in November, but Johnston is seeking shared custody. Both parents are 19. Their teenage relationship fell under an intense public spotlight after Sen. John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate in August 2008.
Court documents, now unsealed, were published online Monday by the Anchorage Daily News.
Johnston joined the family at the Republican National Convention after the campaign confirmed that Bristol, then 17, was five months pregnant with his child. The couple broke off their engagement about two months after their son's birth in December 2008.
Johnston has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin, whom he said was powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive. But Bristol Palin's request that the case be sealed said public proceedings will turn this custody case into a media circus which is not in Tripp's best interest. 
 In this day and age of the Internet, media stories remain available for years, even decades, after they are first published, and anything printed in the media -LRB- whether it is true or not -RRB- will be available to Tripp when he is old enough to read, Palin said in a sworn affidavit.
She said Johnston wanted a public case so he could continue to make a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self-promotion. Johnston was set to take part in a reality show in Alaska, she said.
 I do not believe that it would be in Tripp's best interest for Levi's reality show to be filming this case as it unfolds, or for Levi Johnston to be capitalizing off of this custody case through his reality show, Palin said.
Johnston's sworn statement said he feared what Sarah Palin might do against him if the case were kept secret.
 I really think that closing the court could make this matter very uncivil and potentially open the door for poor influences on Bristol and her attorney that may be extremely inappropriate and potentially harmful to Tripp, he said.
While Johnston said his former girlfriend would never be malicious toward him, her mother is powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive. 
 So, I think a public case might go a long way in reducing Sarah Palin's instinct to attack and allow the real parties in this litigation, Bristol and I, to work things out a lot more peacefully than we could if there is any more meddling from Sarah Palin, Johnston said.
Bristol Palin's affidavit said her mother is not involved in the custody case, except as a grandmother. But Johnston's lawyer, Rex Butler, said in his own affidavit that his client does not trust closed proceedings because Sarah Palin is known to deal forcefully with those she perceives as political enemies. 
 He feels Sarah Palin, through her lawyer, under the guise of Bristol Palin's name, would run roughshod over his very bones, Butler said.
The judge's ruling, signed last week, concludes that Bristol Palin failed to demonstrate that this case involves matters of a sensitive and highly personal natureof such a magnitude that protection of the party's name outweighs the public's interest in disclosure.
Her filing for full custody argued that Levi was not ready for the demands of parenthood and the sacrifices that would entail to a 19-year-old aspiring actor/model. 
 Levi remains without a regular job or steady source of income, the petition states. While he's not enrolled in school to learn a trade or earn a degree, he has made money by selling stories about his son and the Palins to news outlets and engaged in risque modeling for Playgirl magazine, it states.
The photos published last month showed Johnston in semi-nude poses, not with the full frontal nudity that's Palin's filing cited.
The petition cited a series of messages posted on the online social network Twitter.com as evidence that Johnston may have substance abuse issues, based on statements he has made about seeking weed.
Johnston's response said he does not have a Twitter account and has made no such statements about the use of marijuana. 
But Palin's harshest attack was on Levi's mother, Sherry Johnston, who pleaded guilty to a felony drug charge earlier this year.
Palin asked that the paternal grandmother be barred from having any unsupervised visitation with Tripp. Her petition said she may re-offend, keep medications around the house which could be accessible to the baby, have illegal drug users come to the house -LRB- or she could take the baby in her car during a drug sale -RRB-. 
Palin also said that since Sherry Johnston could fall asleep or be too drowsy to appropriately monitor the baby. 
 She is also a chronic pain patient and undergoes daily, regular and sustained narcotic infusions, Palin's petition said.
Johnston's response said his mother's chronic pain condition is currently being managed in coordination with the Department of Corrections. 
 Sherry Johnston will not be left to take care of the minor child alone, but will simply be there to assist to the best of her ability, Johnston's filing said.
She was released from an Alaska prison last week to serve the remainder of her three-year sentence under house arrest at her home in Wasilla, Alaska. She must wear an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring, Corrections Department spokesman Richard Schmitz said.

"Build it and they will come. That appears to have been the strategy for urban development in China over the last decade, during what has arguably been the largest and fastest urbanization of a society in modern history.
In Zhengzhou, the capital of central Henan province, this approach has had mixed results. Just a few years back, a new development zone, an adjunct to the main city, was labeled China's largest ghost city -- rows and rows of luxury apartments and office buildings sat empty on vast, deserted boulevards.
But now locals here say signs of life have sprung up and the city is growing.
On a recent national holiday, visitors flocked to a new park by the river. It was a remarkable green oasis of willow trees, ponds, fountains and man-made marshes surrounded by shining new towers of glass and steel.
Amid the greenery, several wedding couples posed in tuxedos and gowns for professional photographs, the brides pampered by make-up artists.
Among them were the Zhangs, newly-weds who traveled more than a hundred miles for this photo shoot.
Though they clearly appreciated their surroundings, they said they could not afford to live in the sprawling, newly-constructed district of Zhengzhou.
The same went for 25-year-old Li Cai Juan and her friends. Several years ago, she had an office job at a construction company that built some of Zhengzhou's rows of towers.
Fantasy photos for Chinese weddings
Now a school teacher, Li said, The housing prices are too high here, in the newly constructed part of Zhengzhou.
According to the local statistics bureau, the average income per month in Zhengzhou is roughly $483 while property prices in the new district stand at $1,660 per square meter, and are expected to climb.
Amid growing unrest over swollen property markets, Premier Li Keqiang has made affordable property prices a pillar of his leadership. However, tighter controls on property markets, such as limitations on homes per person and higher taxes on transactions, have failed to rein in speculative buyers since they were first implemented in 2010.
The following year, as part of its twelfth five-year plan, the government vowed to build 36 million low-income housing units by 2015 in a bid to quell distressed homebuyers.
The rush to the cities
Demand for housing has followed the migration of workers from rural areas to cities where work is better paid and easier to find. In early 2012, for the first time in history, figures showed that more than half of the country's population live in urban areas.
The pace of urbanization has been staggering and the government is counting on it as a main driver of economic growth for decades to come.
 Currently China's urban population is a little over 700 million people, said Tom Miller, author of China's Urban Billion. 
 By 2030, we would expect it to be one billion. One in eight people on Earth will live in a Chinese city. So they still need to do a lot more building. 
Miller predicts there will always be a huge demand for housing in China. The challenge will be making it affordable for the Chinese people.
Zhengzhou's population boom
According to city government statistics, the population in Zhengzhou grew by 30 % between 2000 and 2010, and today stands at close to nine million people, roughly the same population as New York City -LRB- 8.245 million in 2011 -RRB-, London -LRB- 8.174, 2011 -RRB- and Bangkok -LRB- 8.281, 2010 -RRB-.
But the city appears to have physically grown even faster.
In an area nearly twice the size of San Francisco, entire new districts of towers have sprung where 10 years ago locals say there were empty fields.
Armies of construction crews are still hard at work. Dozens of new towers are in various stages of completion, even though real estate companies are still clearly struggling to fill some of the completed buildings.
On a street corner, two female university students distributed advertising leaflets to passing drivers and held up a buy two floors for the price of one deal for a residential housing development called Harmony Building. 
In the office of another real estate development company, a sales representative told CNN all of the units in neighboring residential towers had been sold. If so, nobody was bothering to maintain the grounds around the apartment buildings where knee-high grass and weeds grew between 30-story towers.
Speculators move in
Meanwhile, real estate sales appeared to be moving more briskly at the Zheng Dong Business Center, where visitors were greeted by football tables, plush velvet couches, a piano, wine and hors d'oeuvres arranged around giant illuminated models of an office park.
Upon arrival, a sales team escorted CNN into a cinema with 180 degree, IMAX-like screen that played an elaborate computer-illustrated film advertising five-star hotels, gyms, shopping malls, offices and restaurants that would one day populate the new development.
It would be another five or six years before this virtual city center would be completed, said a saleswoman named Song Lei.
Asked whether or not she expected there to be enough customers to fill the giant office park, Song said, Altogether, probably not.
 There are some people buying office buildings for investment and there are others who are using it themselves, she explained.
Some of China's soaring real estate market appears to be driven by wealthy Chinese who prefer parking their money in property rather than in banks where interest rates remain the same as inflation. In less than one year, property prices in Zhengzhou jumped 14 %, while the benchmark interest rate remains at 3 %.
Two Chinese men who worked as contractors in the construction industry were finalizing a deal on the purchase of two offices in the Zheng Dong Business Center's still unfinished office park.
Both men said they owned multiple properties in the area, some of which were vacant.
 He owns 20 apartments here ! said one of the businessman's employees, laughing. Come back after 10 years and have a look and it will be completely different, he said, when asked about Zhengzhou's ghost town tag.
The businessman, who asked not to be named, said he earned far better returns in real estate than from banks.
Miller said the buy-up of property in China is further encouraged by the fact that unlike many Western countries, there is no annual property tax.
 You pay transaction taxes when you buy a property, but once you 've bought it you do n't pay anything, which is remarkable, he said.
Build them and they will come ?
Compared to China, the history of urbanization in the West is different. Things happened at a much slower pace, said Behzad Yaghmaian, a political economist and author of The Accidental Capitalist -- A People's Story of the New China. 
 China is a huge country with the capacity to supply the world and now its own market. Things are bound to happen faster and with more mistakes. 
The jury is still out on whether or not huge urban development projects like the new districts of Zhengzhou will become vibrant city centers.
But Miller challenges critics who quickly labeled Zhengzhou a ghost city. 
He said in the past few years city planners had constructed 14 new university campuses in the city, which he predicted would ensure a quarter of a million new residents.
 China is different because it has this very authoritarian power structure. Power rests in the hands of very few people, and that means that local government officials can take big decisions looking ahead 10, 15 years... and create something for a society that has n't really arrived yet, Miller said.
 It's build them and they will come, Miller added, and build it and force them to come. But of course there will be some big wasteful developments, white elephants, along the way.

"Vienna is the world's best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life. 
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna joined by Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven. 
Paris has tumbled down the league, falling ten places to 37th, just ahead of London at 39th, almost entirely because of the city's vulnerability to terrorist attacks. 
The study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff. 
Viennese-born Helena Hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her city's top position. The municipality's social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making Vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities. 
""I live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutes' walk from the city centre. But my rent is just EUR800 (GBP625) a month."" An equivalent apartment in London would cost upwards of GBP2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table. 
US cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. The highest ranking city in the US is San Francisco, at 28th; Boston is 34th. Canadian cities, led by Vancouver, far outrank their US rivals in the table. 
""You don't realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad,"" said Hartlauer. ""We also have terrific public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs EUR1 per trip."" 
Vienna benefited enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic ties to the former Austro-Hungarian empire. 
""Our big USP is our geographical location,"" said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassdaor to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years. ""The fall of the Berlin Wall helped define Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe."" 
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest figures for GDP per head in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although quite some way below neighbouring Switzerland. 
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the world's second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun. ""There are more students in Vienna than any other German-speaking city,"" said Hartlauer. ""It's a very fast growing, young and lively city,"" she added - though she conceded she works for the city's tourist board. 
Vienna has long been overlooked by British weekend city break tourists, who instead flock to Barcelona or Berlin and tend to think of Austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains. But, after an increase in budget flights from regional British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. In 2015, there were 588,000 British visitors to Vienna, up 18% on the year before. The flow is both ways; Eichtinger said London has become the number one city destination for Austrian visitors. 
""Vienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,"" said Mercer. ""It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities."" 
The European migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through Vienna en route to Germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said Eichtinger. ""We have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in Austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months."" London has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says Mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traffic congestion and climate. After London, Edinburgh is the next-ranking British city, in 46th place. 
Paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. ""Paris remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,"" said Mercer. 
""The drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. However, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the 'basket' so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking."" 
Auckland in New Zealand was the highest ranking English-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by Vancouver in fifth. Australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th. The Economist has consistently ranked Melbourne as the world's most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too Anglocentric. 
War and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. Surprisingly, Damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just Baghdad but also Bangui in Central African Republic, Sana'a in Yemen, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Khartoum in Sudan and N'Djamena in Chad.

"Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show. But Google, in the US, sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car. 
The electrically powered vehicle, which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, dispenses with all the normal controls, including foot pedals. Instead, it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination, and a single STOP button mounted between the two front-facing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer. 
The car, in fact, takes over all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking. 
The company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test. The company's co-founder, Sergey Brin, told a conference in California that the vehicle was ""still in the prototype stage"" but that the project was ""about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today "". 
He said of the car: ""You're just sitting there; no steering wheel, no pedals. For me, it was very relaxing. About ten seconds after getting in, I forgot I was there. It reminded me of catching a chairlift by yourself - a bit of solitude I found really enjoyable."" 
Google says that the principal aim of the project is to improve safety and that, because the car is constructed with impact-absorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen, ""it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians"". 
The cars, which have been built specially by a company (as yet unnamed) in Detroit, will be used to investigate further how best to make driverless vehicles work. Google will run a pilot programme using the cars, which are not yet for sale. 
One challenge is creating high-definition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot gather and process enough information in real time. 
So far, there are high-detail maps of about 2,000 miles of California's roads, but the state has more than 170,000 miles of public roads. 
Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has refined it sufficiently. Members of the team had been working on the project even before joining Google, for more than a decade. 
But the prospect of driverless cars replacing human-driven taxis has been the cause of some alarm. 
""If you get rid of the driver, then they're unemployed,"" said Dennis Conyon, the south- east director for the UK National Taxi Association. ""It would have a major impact on the labour force."" 
London has about 22,000 licensed black cabs and Conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the UK is about 100,000. 
However, Steve McNamara, general secretary of the 10,500-strong London Taxi Drivers' Association, said: ""You won't get these driverless cars in London for 20 or 25 years. Maybe, by then, they'll have a charge point - because there isn't a single one in London now."" 
Other car makers, including Volvo, Ford and Mercedes, are working on driver-assisted vehicles, which, unlike Google's version, do not dispense with the driver controls. 
But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car project at Google, said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because there was no guarantee that a human occupant would be able to take over in an emergency, and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button. 
Urmson said: ""The vehicles will be very basic. We want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible. But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button. And, that's an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people."" 
So far, the Google versions of the self-driving cars have covered 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer. The company points out that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80% of crashes can be ascribed to human error. 
But, they could have some way to go to match Conyon at the National Taxi Association. Aged 79, he has been driving a taxi for 50 years and claims never to have had an accident.

"In U.S. cities like New York City and Los Angeles, many people live in small apartments. Despite not having homes with big yards, some apartment dwellers still seek the companionship that domesticated animals like dogs and cats offer. Some people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good for teaching children responsibility.
 
However, many landlords forbid tenants from having pets, specifically cats and dogs, because of the damage the animals can do to carpets. Some landlords even forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many landlords charge an extra fee, known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs or cleaning caused by the pet.
Many times apartment dwellers will choose animals, like fish, hermit crabs, guinea pigs or hamsters, that make little noise, little mess, and won't chew up the furniture. Other people keep lizards as pets, since they don't require much space and can be kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they don't need to be walked. However, some people who live in apartments have pets that are not so ordinary. Some of these less than ordinary pets include mammals like hedgehogs, amphibians like frogs, and spiders like tarantulas. Not all exotic pets are legal though.
In order to maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws banning specific animals as pets. New York City, for example, bans people from keeping ferrets, snapping turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a family would have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale named Bubbles as a pet, New York City has specific laws banning these wild animals from residences. These laws exist for a good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment was discovered to have a 350-pound Bengal tiger as a pet.",C1
"You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the world's drinking capital, New Orleans, Louisiana. City after city has banned indoor smoking but that's different because other cities don't attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a ""let the good times roll"" attitude, as New Orleans does. An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleans's cultural ecosystem itself. 
As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, New Orleans city government has, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time, fighting to implement a new ""noise ordinance"" (read: music ordinance). 
""This is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,"" complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. ""Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension that's already there."" 
Many of New Orleans's best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleans's musical personality feels at stake. 
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. ""The bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I won't ever complain about the noise,"" says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of New Orleans's first ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. ""Now, any small infraction could get us shut down,"" says Wood. ""We recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we can't open the doors at night because of the 'noise'."" 
The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. ""A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesn't host music,"" says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, ""The horn players and the singers, they asked us for it."" 
Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban - he'd previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar financially viable. ""There's no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,"" says Douville. ""People act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody."" 
Many small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England. ""Back home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,"" remembers Timms of the UK's ban, begun in 2007. To avoid the same fate, he's spending money to build a patio. 
Lost Love's Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity. ""The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didn't want to smell like smoke for the next seven days - we're now an option for all those people."" Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: ""No court is gonna label a bar a 'nuisance' after the city has ratified a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!"" he says. ""I want to see a judge reconcile 'no loitering' with 'no smoking inside'."" 
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: ""The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,"" she says. ""The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. The idea that we can't have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. It can be a win-win. I think it's about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses."" 
Cantrell does acknowledge the city's uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. ""How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as 'the City that Care Forgot',"" she says. ""New Orleans needs to stand up and say 'We care about our people'. The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana."" She adds, ""New Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke."" 
Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didn't need any part in policing smokers. So the health department will handle bar warnings and fines. Bar customers are encouraged to ""come fill out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking"". For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he'll comply with the ban: ""I don't want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of 'em and gets beaten up."" 
Unworried, Geoff Douville says that he's used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. ""Watch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with."" In the end, Douville shares Cantrell's win-win optimism. ""Of course they're gonna complain,"" he accepts. ""But it doesn't mean they're gonna win.""

"Yellowstone National Park, located in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, was established as the first national park in the United States. The park is a popular destination for visitors who enjoy ecological tourism as it offers forests, mountains, and abundant ecosystems to explore. Some of Yellowstone's most well-known landmarks are its geothermal hot springs and geysers, the most famous of which is named Old Faithful.
Last fall, Lisa and her friends decided to take a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. They arranged to stay at one of the park's many convenient campsites. For their camping trip, they brought their backpacks, sleeping bags, and a cooler of food and drinks. They pitched their tents immediately upon arriving to their campsite.
During their trip, Lisa and her friends hiked the many trails of the park, exploring its natural surroundings. In the forest, they saw a lot of local wildlife. Lisa was surprised to see a family of grizzly bears, some gray wolves, and even bald eagles flying overhead. Outside of the woods, they admired the beauty of some of Yellowstone's natural cascades.
Since Yellowstone contains many hot springs and the world's largest area of active geysers, Lisa and her friends visited many different geyser sites. They even spent an afternoon swimming in Yellowstone's Boiling River. Of all of the sites, Lisa and her friends agreed that Old Faithful was the most impressive. Lisa and her friends waited patiently for the geyser to erupt. After about 40 minutes, a stream of boiling water over 100 feet tall sprayed from the ground and up into the air. Fortunately, no one got wet!",C1
"When exploring New York City, there are several different options for activities during a day trip. Some visitors come to see a show, visit art museums, or simply to shop in many of the city's high-end retailers. However, many tourists simply come to New York City for the sightseeing. One of the most visited landmarks in New York City is the Empire State Building.
The Empire State Building, constructed in 1931, is a 102-story skyscraper, the ninth highest building in the world, and the fourth tallest structure in the United States. It is located in Midtown, Manhattan. This skyscraper is an iconic symbol of the city, having been featured in over 90 popular movies (as of 2018) throughout film history. Tourists come from all over the world to visit this building and view the city from its famous observation decks.
Matthew, an enthusiast of historic buildings, was excited for this trip to New York City because he has always appreciated architectural design. Matthew purchased a ticket that granted him access to beautiful 360-degree views of the city. The ticket included an elevator ride that stopped at two different vantage points, one at the 86th floor and the other at the rooftop observatory on the 102nd floor. From these observation decks, Matthew took incredible photographs of the entire New York City skyline. The rooftop views granted Matthew perfect aerial perspectives of Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, and many other important city landmarks.",C1
"A new study published in the journal Science shows definitive evidence of organic matter on the surface of Mars. The data was collected by NASA's nuclear-powered rover Curiosity. It confirms earlier findings that the Red Planet once contained carbon-based compounds. These compounds - also called organic molecules - are essential ingredients for life as scientists understand it.
The organic molecules were found in Mars's Gale Crater, a large area that may have been a watery lake over three billion years ago. The rover encountered traces of the molecule in rocks extracted from the area. The rocks also contain sulfur, which scientists speculate helped preserve the organics even when the rocks were exposed to the harsh radiation on the surface of the planet.
 
Scientists are quick to state that the presence of these organic molecules is not sufficient evidence for ancient life on Mars, as the molecules could have been formed by non-living processes. But it's still one of the most astonishing discoveries, which could lead to future revelations. Especially when one considers the other startling find that Curiosity uncovered around five years ago.
 
The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane. One of the characteristics of methane is that it only survives a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is replenishing the supply. According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it.
 
NASA suspects the methane comes from deep under the surface of the planet. The variations in temperature on the surface of Mars cause the molecule to flow upwards at higher or lower levels. For example, in the Martian winter the gas could get trapped in underground icy crystals. These crystals, called clathrates, melt in the summer and release the gas. However, the source of the methane is still a complete mystery.
 
The world of astrobiology considers both of these studies as historical milestones. According to this information, Mars is not a dead planet. On the contrary, it is quite active and may be changing and becoming more habitable.
 
Of course, this means further research is necessary. Scientists say they need to send new equipment to Mars, equipment that can measure the air and soil with more precision. There are already missions underway. The European Space Agency's ExoMars ship lands in 2020 and will be able to drill into the ground on Mars to analyse what it finds. Additionally, NASA is sending another Mars Rover in the same year to collect samples of Martian soil and return them to Earth.
 
The possibility of life on Mars has fascinated humans for generations. It has been the subject of endless science-fiction novels and films. Are we alone in the universe or have there been other life forms within our Solar System? If the current missions to the Red Planet continue, it looks as if we may discover the answer very soon. ",C1
"For 85 years, it was little more than a featureless grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system, but, on 15 July, Pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time, revealing dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice on a scale to rival the Alps or the Rockies. 
The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, Charon, beamed 4bn miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft, mark the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly a decade. 
Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, described the images as a ""home run"" for the team. ""New Horizons is returning amazing results already. The data look absolutely gorgeous, and Pluto and Charon are just mind-blowing."" 
One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that ""there are mountains in the Kuiper belt "", the solar system's mysterious ""third zone"" where Pluto sits amid around 100,000 smaller icy objects. John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 11,000ft high and several hundred miles across. ""These are pretty significant mountains."" 
The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater, hinting that the surface has been recently ""paved over"" by geological activity, which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock. 
In a nod to Pluto's former status as the ninth planet, until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, the NASA press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. ""We've brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,"" said Dwayne Brown, NASA spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled. 
Stern described the images as ""just skimming the surface"" of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year. They have already produced some surprises. Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of ""exotic"" ices, methane and nitrogen. ""You can't make mountains out of methane and nitrogen,"" said Spencer. 
""Water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that's what we think we're seeing here. This is the first time we've seen this. The methane and nitrogen are just a coating."" The mountains on Pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago - extremely recently given the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. This suggests the close-up region, which covers about 1% of Pluto's surface, may still be geologically active. The images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape. 
The structures, together with the smoothness of Pluto's surface, suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts. Scientists believe this ""paving"" process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface. For scale, the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over London, we would be able to pick out the runways at Heathrow airport. 
The distance to Pluto - 5bn km - means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the fly-by. The team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, in honour of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930. 
The new view of Charon reveals a varied, complex terrain. An area of cliffs and troughs stretching about 1,000km suggests widespread fracturing of Charon's surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. The image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep. 
Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: ""Charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today. The team has just been abuzz. 
There is so much interesting science in this one image alone."" Pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230C. As the GBP460m mission travels onwards into the Kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets, potentially helping to explain the formation of the Earth itself. 
Andrew Coates, head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: ""These Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. They're all very cold - it's like a cosmic deep freeze. It's the best way of preserving solar system history. That is what is so fascinating about this. It's a really thrilling time for solar system exploration."" 
In August 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. NASA estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mid-2030s. Then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down, drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond. 
New Horizons also observed the smaller members of the Pluto system, which includes four other moons: Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos. A new sneak-peek image of Hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size, estimated to be about 43 by 33km. ""New Horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. 
""The mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to Pluto and Charon. Today, we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and I can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations."" 
The observations also indicate Hydra's surface is probably coated with water ice. Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.

"The vast fortunes made by the world's richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the world's ability to tackle poverty, according to Oxfam. 
The charity said the accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale, often at the expense of secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest, undermined the ability of people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty. 
Oxfam said the world's poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012. 
Without pointing a finger at individuals, the charity argued that the $240bn net income amassed in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over. 
It is rare for charities to attack the wealthy, who are usually regarded as a source of funding. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 US billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations. Their actions have also not been matched by Russian, Middle Eastern or Chinese billionaires. 
In the report, The Cost of Inequality: How Wealth and Income Extremes Hurt Us All , published just before the World Economic Forum in Davos, the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels. 
The report found that the richest 1% had increased their incomes by 60% in the past 20 years, with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process. 
Barbara Stocking, Oxfam's Chief Executive, said extreme wealth was ""economically inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive"". 
She said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes. 
She said: ""We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many - too often the reverse is true."" 
The report said the issue affected all parts of the world. ""In the UK, inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of Charles Dickens [the nineteenth-century novelist]. In China, the top 10% now take home nearly 60% of the income. Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa, which is now the most unequal country on Earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid."" 
In the US, the share of national income going to the top 1% has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20%, the report says. For the top 0.01% the share of national income is above levels last seen in the 1920s. 
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have attempted to tie their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality. 
Members of the richest 1% are estimated to use as much as 10,000 times more carbon than the average US citizen. 
Oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as Brazil, which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality. 
Stocking said: ""We need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality. As a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990."" 
She said closing tax havens, which the Tax Justice Network says hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could yield $189bn in additional tax revenues.

"Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
Debbie Rowe will not pursue custody of the children she bore with Michael Jackson, a lawyer says.
The agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe apart from the continuation of spousal support payments that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after their divorce, the lawyers said.
Rowe will get visitation rights with the children and the timing, frequency and manner of visits shall be implemented according to the best interests of the children, as determined by a child psychologist selected jointly, and paid jointly, by Jackson and Rowe, the announcement said.
Rowe never publicly said if she would fight Jackson's 79-year-old mother for custody of her son and daughter -- ages 11 and 12 -- and a court hearing concerning custody was delayed several times this month while lawyers for the two talked. Jackson's youngest child, 7, was carried by a surrogate mother, whose name has not yet been released.
Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of the three children soon after his death last month. Learn about other notable custody cases 
The agreement must be approved by the judge. A custody hearing is set for Monday before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff.
Beckloff will also hear arguments Monday about Jackson's estate and who will control it. Katherine Jackson is asking the court for more involvement in the estate's business. Watch what may have happened in Jackson's final hours 
Jackson family lawyer Londell McMillan said the family was pleased the custody matter was resolved and was handled in a caring, thoughtful and courteous manner by the parties and their representatives. 
 We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page, McMillan said. Accordingly, although important issues had to be resolved, this was no legal contest but rather simply a process -LRB- of -RRB- doing the right thing for the right reasons. 
Rowe's lawyer, Eric George, said the women and their lawyers engaged in a dignified discussion that resulted in a dignified outcome. 
 The sole consideration between the parties was the best interests of the children, George said. I 'm proud to have worked with such professionals who represented Ms. Jackson, and I am particularly proud of Deborah for her integrity and selflessness. 
Efforts to resolve who will control Jackson's estate have not been so amicable.
Earlier this month, Beckloff granted temporary control to the executors named in his 2002 will: John Branca, Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend.
McMillan, in a statement issued Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will. But, he said, she wanted the judge to order the executors to disclose information about what he said was a suspicious circle of relationships involving them.
He said the executors have either denied Mrs. Jackson access to critical information or insisted on... onerous and unreasonable restrictions to information about deals they are making on behalf of the estate.
McMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million.
The will placed all assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities.
Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death on June 25.
 They read the news on the Web and the reports, McMillan said. I really tried to push the media to be responsible in how they try to handle this matter because there are three precious children involved. 
The oldest child -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., more commonly known as Prince Michael -- was born in February 1997. A daughter -- Paris Michael Katherine Jackson -- was born the next year.
Details of how the children were conceived -- and who was the biological father -- have been closely guarded amid much public speculation.
The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle.

"Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a twin car-bombing a week ago clashed with police Saturday, as they voiced anger over the government's response to the attack.
About 50 people were killed and about 100 injured when the blasts went off in the southern town of Reyhanli, in across the border from Syria's Idlib province, on May 11. One was at the community's city hall and the other in front of a post office.
The protest Saturday began relatively peacefully but descended into chaos as running street clashes broke out with police.
Protesters threw rocks and bottles at the police, who responded by firing tear gas canisters and high-pressure paintballs. Officers also brought out a water cannon.
Women and children ran from the scene as thick clouds of tear gas spread through the streets at the heart of the confrontation.
Police prevented the protesters from reaching the site of the blasts in the center of the town, which lies in Turkey's southern Hatay province.
The police have not yet commented on the clashes, which quietened down after less than an hour.
The protest -- which started with several thousand people but dwindled to a hard core of several hundred as trouble broke out -- was intended to show support and solidarity for the people of Reyhanli in the wake of the deadly bombings.
Many people in the town are angry at the government's response and say its decision to take in Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country has made Turkey a target for attacks.
The crowd chanted calls for Erdogan and the government to resign.
One family of demonstrators was mourning the death of Ayten Calim, a 20-year-old secretary from Reyhanli who was killed in the bombings last Saturday.
Her brother, Halim Calim, said, We are here to voice our pain. He and another brother carried Turkish flags and a banner with Ayten's photo on it that read, We will not forget. 
Some have criticized Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for traveling to the United States this week instead of coming to Reyhanli to show support.
Erdogan has held talks with U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials in Washington.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Reyhanli Thursday, when he vowed that those responsible for the car bombs would be held accountable.
Celalettin Lekesiz, governor of Hatay province, said Saturday that security forces had detained 17 people so far in connection with the bomb attacks and are hunting for four others, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported.
All 21 suspects are Turkish nationals, he said.
Lekesiz said the security forces now had detailed information about how the suspects allegedly acquired the explosives and staged the bomb attacks, the news agency reported.
Interior Minister Muammer Guler and other Turkish officials have accused a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Al Muhabarat, Syria's intelligence services, according to Anadolu.

"Sony has cut the price of the PlayStation 3 by $100, or 17 percent, in the United States, a move that should boost the video game console's lackluster sales.
Starting Monday, the current PS3 60 gigabyte model will cost $499 -- a $100 price drop.
The PlayStation 3, which includes a 60-gigabyte hard drive and a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player, will now cost $500, or $20 more than the most expensive version of Microsoft's Xbox 360.
The PS3 still costs twice that of Nintendo's Wii console, whose $250 price and motion-sensing controller have made it a best-seller despite its lack of cutting-edge graphics and hard disk.
 Our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum, Jack Tretton, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America, said in an interview.
 We 've gotten our production issues behind us on the PlayStation 3, reaching a position to pass on the savings to consumers, and our attitude is the sooner the better. 
The price drop Monday was widely anticipated by industry analysts despite Sony President Ryoji Chubachi telling Reuters last week that the company had no immediate plans for one.
Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter said Sony's price reduction would not double sales but may boost them by 50 percent to about 120,000 units a month.
 The greater significance is that Sony is signaling to the market that we 're coming down the cost curve pretty fast in making this thing. It's a pretty consumer-friendly move, Pachter said.
Sony's move comes two days before the start of the video game industry's annual E3 trade show in Santa Monica, California, where some expect Microsoft to respond with its first price cuts on the Xbox 360.
Nintendo, whose Wii is selling so well that it is still hard to find in stores eight months after its launch, is not expected to budge on pricing.
The Xbox 360 and Wii have outsold the PS3 by several times in the crucial U.S. market, leaving Sony, whose PlayStation 2 dominated the last console generation, in the unfamiliar position of playing catch up.
Sony is counting on the price cut to help it significantly grow sales of the PS3 ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season that accounts for most of the annual sales of highly profitable gaming software.
Sony is also introducing a new version of the PS3 featuring an 80-gigabyte hard drive and a copy of Motorstorm, an off-road racing game that has already sold a million copies.
The new model will sell for $600 and is aimed at gamers who expect to download a lot of games and other content from Sony's burgeoning online network.
Sony also hopes the PS3 will win some converts following Microsoft's admission last week that the failure rate of its Xbox 360 console had been unacceptably high, forcing it to book $1 billion in repair costs.
 We 're especially proud of the fact that the PlayStation 3 has the lowest failure rate of any PlayStation product. It's absolutely the gold standard, Tretton said.
 The quality of the product and long-term viability is what ultimately wins. E-mail to a friend

"Much of today's business is conducted across international borders, and while the majority of the global business community might share the use of English as a common language, the nuances and expectations of business communication might differ greatly from culture to culture. A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. Here are three basic areas of differences in the business etiquette around the world that could help stand you in good stead when you next find yourself working with someone from a different culture.
Addressing someone
When discussing this topic in a training course, a German trainee and a British trainee got into a hot debate about whether it was appropriate for someone with a doctorate to use the corresponding title on their business card. The British trainee maintained that anyone who wasn't a medical doctor expecting to be addressed as 'Dr' was disgustingly pompous and full of themselves. The German trainee, however, argued that the hard work and years of education put into earning that PhD should give them full rights to expect to be addressed as 'Dr'.
This stark difference in opinion over something that could be conceived as minor and thus easily overlooked goes to show that we often attach meaning to even the most mundane practices. When things that we are used to are done differently, it could spark the strongest reactions in us. While many Continental Europeans and Latin Americans prefer to be addressed with a title, for example Mr or Ms and their surname when meeting someone in a business context for the first time, Americans, and increasingly the British, now tend to prefer using their first names. The best thing to do is to listen and observe how your conversation partner addresses you and, if you are still unsure, do not be afraid to ask them how they would like to be addressed.
Smiling
A famous Russian proverb states that 'a smile without reason is a sign of idiocy' and a so-called 'smile of respect' is seen as insincere and often regarded with suspicion in Russia. Yet in countries like the United States, Australia and Britain, smiling is often interpreted as a sign of openness, friendship and respect, and is frequently used to break the ice.
In a piece of research done on smiles across cultures, the researchers found that smiling individuals were considered more intelligent than non-smiling people in countries such as Germany, Switzerland, China and Malaysia. However, in countries like Russia, Japan, South Korea and Iran, pictures of smiling faces were rated as less intelligent than the non-smiling ones. Meanwhile, in countries like India, Argentina and the Maldives, smiling was associated with dishonesty.
Eye contact
An American or British person might be looking their client in the eye to show that they are paying full attention to what is being said, but if that client is from Japan or Korea, they might find the direct eye contact awkward or even disrespectful. In parts of South America and Africa, prolonged eye contact could also be seen as challenging authority. In the Middle East, eye contact across genders is considered inappropriate, although eye contact within a gender could signify honesty and truthfulness.
Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural stereotypes can be detrimental to building good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.",C1
"The Virunga National Park, home to rare mountain gorillas but targeted for oil exploration by a British company, could earn trouble-torn DR Congo $400m a year from tourism, hydropower and carbon credits, said a WWF report. 
But, if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the equator is exploited for oil, as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in an already unstable region, says the conservation body. 
SOCO International is the only company seeking to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park. SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be confined to an area in the park known as Block V, and would not affect the gorillas. 
SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said: ""Despite the views of WWF, SOCO is extremely sensitive to the environmental significance of the Virunga National Park. It is irrefutable that oil companies still have a central role in today's global energy supply and a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social well-being of a whole country.""
He added: ""The park has sadly been in decline for many years, officially falling below the standards required for a World Heritage Site. The potential for development just might be the catalyst that reverses this trend."" 
However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo, based in Kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would deteriorate further if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans. 
""The security situation is already bad. The UN is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park. Oil would be a curse. It always increases conflict. It would attract human sabotage. The park might become like the Niger Delta. Developing Virunga for oil will not make anything better. 
""The population there is already very dense, with over 350 people per square kilometre. When you take part of the land (for oil), you put more pressure on the rest. Oil would not provide many jobs; people would flood in looking for work,"" he said. 
One fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the lakes. ""Virunga's rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people, not for foreign oil prospectors to drain away. Our country's future depends on sustainable economic development,"" said Lumbuenamo. 
""For me, choosing the conservation option is the best option. Once you have started drilling for oil, there's no turning back,"" he said. 
But Lumbuenamo accepted that, while the gorillas were safe at present, the chances of the park generating its potential of $400m a year were remote. ""It would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of. Virunga used to be a very peaceful place and can be again. The security situation right now is bad. The UN is involved with fighting units. It's not as quiet as it used to be."" 
According to the WWF report, ecosystems in the park could support hydropower generation, fishing and ecotourism, and play an important role in providing secure water supplies, regulating climate and preventing soil erosion. 
The park, Africa's oldest and most diverse, is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals, but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people, many of whom fled there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994. 
""In all, the park could support in the region of 45,000 permanent jobs. In addition, people around the world could get an immense value from simply knowing that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations,"" says the report. 
""Virunga represents a valuable asset to DR Congo and contributes to Africa's heritage as the oldest and most biodiverse park on the continent,"" the report continues. ""Plans to explore for oil and exploit oil reserves put Virunga's potential value at risk,"" it says. 
""This is where we draw the line. Oil companies are standing on the doorstep of one of the world's most precious and fragile places, but we will not rest until Virunga is safe from this potential environmental disaster,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of WWF International. ""Virunga has snow fields and lava fields, but it should not have oil fields."" 
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee called for the cancellation of all Virunga oil permits and appealed to concession holders Total SA and SOCO International plc not to undertake exploration in World Heritage Sites. Total has committed to respecting Virunga's current boundary, leaving UK-based SOCO as the only oil company with plans to explore inside the park.

"Manchester United have accepted a world-record $130 million offer for Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid.
Ronaldo is set to smash the world record transfer fee if he agrees to move to Real Madrid.
The English champions have given the big-spending Spanish giants permission to talk to the World Player of the Year, according to the official United Web site.
United said on Thursday that the Portugal winger had again expressed his desire to leave Old Trafford, and the club now expect the deal to be concluded by June 30.
Madrid confirmed on the club's Web site that it hoped to seal an agreement with Ronaldo in the coming days. 
Real, who have fallen behind bitter rivals Barcelona, have swooped to follow up the $92 million signing of Brazil star Kaka from AC Milan earlier this week. What's your view ? Tell us what you think about Ronaldo joining Real.
Real also held the previous record when they paid $77 million -LRB- now worth $108 million -RRB- for Zinedine Zidane in 2001.
The club's president Florentino Perez said after the Kaka deal was concluded that he would do everything possible to sign the 24-year-old Ronaldo, as he sought to build a new empire that would match his first stint at the Bernabeu. The 20 most wanted players in the world.
United held off Real's advances last summer, with manager Alex Ferguson traveling to the Portugal camp during the Euro 2008 finals to hold crisis talks with Ronaldo.
The player committed himself to another season in Manchester, but was affected by injuries early on and -- despite a sizzling end to the campaign -- was unable to help United retain the UEFA Champions League title, losing to Barcelona in last month's final.
Perez is seeking to rebuild a team which finished second in the Primera Liga last season, nine points behind Barcelona, and again failed to progress past the first knockout stage of Europe's premier club competition.
He failed in his first bid for the presidency in 1995, but won the 2000 elections on a promise to sign Luis Figo from Barca.
Perez duly brought in the Portuguese forward and followed it up with a series of budget-busting transfers, including that of Zidane and David Beckham, as he created a team dubbed the Galacticos. 
United have been linked with moves to sign Bayern Munich's France star Franck Ribery and Wigan's Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia as Ferguson seeks to replace Ronaldo. Check out the latest transfer rumors and gossip.
Perez has also expressed an interest in bringing Ribery to Spain from Germany.
Ronaldo moved to Old Trafford in August 2003 in a $20 million transfer from Sporting Lisbon just days after scoring against United in a pre-season friendly.
He made his first senior outing for the national side that November and helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in May before suffering heartache as Portugal lost to underdogs Greece in the final of Euro 2004 on home soil.
In November 2005, he agreed a two-year extension to his contract until 2010.
He was vilified in England in the summer of 2006 after his antics helped get United clubmate Wayne Rooney sent off as Portugal progressed to the semi-finals of the World Cup in Germany.
After the tournament, Ronaldo revealed that he would like to leave United, but at the end of the 2006-07 season the forward agreed a new five-year contract. Watch CNN on why Ronaldo moved 
The next campaign he beat George Best's 40-year-old club record for goals scored by a winger in a single season, with 33 in the Premier League and 42 overall.
Ronaldo suffered an ankle injury as Portugal lost 3-2 to Germany in the quarter-finals of Euro 2008, and told Portuguese newspaper Publico he would remain with United for at least another year .
In December he was named Europe's top player, then the next month he escaped uninjured after writing off his Ferrari sports car when crashing into a roadside barrier under a tunnel near Manchester Airport on his way to training. Read about it here.
Ronaldo was named FIFA World Player of the Year on January 12 and went on to held United retain the Premier League title, but the club failed to become the first to retain the Champions League since its inception in 1992.

"A few months before he died, Carl Sagan recorded a message of hope to would-be Mars explorers, telling them: ""Whatever the reason you're on Mars is, I'm glad you're there. And I wish I was with you."" 
Seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer set out his hopeful vision of the future in 1996, a company from the Netherlands is proposing to turn Sagan's dreams of reaching Mars into reality. The company, Mars One, plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a human colony in 2023. But there are a couple of serious snags. 
Firstly, when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38% of that on Earth. It is thought that this would cause such a total physiological change in their bone density, muscle strength and circulation that voyagers would no longer be able to survive in Earth's conditions. Secondly, and directly related to the first, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, as the deal doesn't include a return ticket. 
The Mars One website states that a return ""cannot be anticipated nor expected"". To return, they would need a fully assembled and fuelled rocket capable of escaping the gravitational field of Mars, on-board life support systems capable of up to a seven-month voyage and the capacity either to dock with a space station orbiting Earth or perform a safe re-entry and landing. ""Not one of these is a small endeavour,"" the site notes, requiring ""substantial technical capacity, weight and cost"". 
Nevertheless, the project has already had 10,000 applicants, according to the company's Medical Director, Norbert Kraft. He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and, though they include women, they tended to be men. 
The reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied, he said. An American woman called Cynthia, who gave her age as 32, told the company that it was a ""childhood imagining"" of hers to go to Mars. She described a trip her mother had taken her on in the early 1990s to a lecture at the University of Wisconsin. 
She said the lecturer had been Sagan and she had asked him if he thought humans would land on Mars in her lifetime. Cynthia said: ""He in turn asked me if I wanted to be trapped in a 'tin can spacecraft' for the two years it would take to get there. I told him 'yes', he smiled, and told me in all seriousness, that yes, he absolutely believed that humans would reach Mars in my lifetime."" 
She told the project: ""When I first heard about the Mars One project I thought, this is my chance - that childhood dream could become a reality. I could be one of the pioneers, building the first settlement on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for."" 
The prime attributes Mars One is looking for in astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness, according to Kraft. They must also be over 18. 
Founded in 2010 by Bas Lansdorp, an engineer, Mars One says it has developed a realistic road map and financing plan for the project based on existing technologies and that the mission is perfectly feasible. The website states that the basic elements required for life are already present on the planet. For instance, water can be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe. The colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels, it says. 
Mars One said it had signed a contract with the American firm Paragon Space Development Corporation to take the first steps in developing the life support system and spacesuits fit for the mission. 
The project will cost a reported $6bn, a sum Lansdorp has said he hopes will be met partly by selling broadcasting rights. ""The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars,"" Lansdorp said, in an interview with ABC News. 
Another ambassador to the project is Paul Romer, the co-creator of Big Brother, one of the first, and most successful, reality TV shows. 
On the website, Romer gave an indication of how the broadcasting of the project might proceed: ""This mission to Mars could be the biggest media event in the world,"" said Romer. ""Reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching."" 
The aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to the company's website. The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin constructing the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that. 
The project is not without its sceptics, however, and concerns have been raised about how astronauts might get to the planet and establish a colony with all the life support and other requirements needed. 
Professor Gerard't Hooft, winner of the Nobel Prize for theoretical physics in 1999, is an ambassador for the project.' T Hooft admits there are unknown health risks. The radiation is ""of quite a different nature"" from anything that has been tested on Earth, he said. 
The mission hopes to inspire generations to ""believe that all things are possible, that anything can be achieved,"" much like the Apollo Moon landings. 
""Mars One believes it is not only possible, but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on Mars in order to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe,"" it says.

"Russell Crowe, born in New Zealand in 1964, is a musician, actor, and philanthropist. He has gained considerable success in the film industry. Crowe spent much of his life living in Australia and the United States, but it was in New Zealand where he first became involved in the entertainment industry. As a teenager, Crowe began developing his musical talent, but he found little success. He had several of his songs played on New Zealand radio, but none made the charts. He turned to acting after moving to Australia, where he appeared in several stage productions, including the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He landed a role in the television comedy Neighbors, and made his film debut in 1990.
 
Crowe became a popular movie star for his performance in the epic film Gladiator. In the film he portrays a Roman general who is slated to become a high-ranking official, but the leader dies, and is replaced by his evil, neurotic son. The new leader fears Crowe's character, and strips him of his rank. He was put into a state of slavery, but becomes a champion gladiator, and leads a revolt against the leader's regime. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Crowe won the award for Best Actor.
He followed his success in Gladiator with a string of highly entertaining movies, culminating with the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. The film follows the life of Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. Crowe expertly plays Nash, who is brilliant, but suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Crowe's performance earned him several awards for Best Actor and the Best Movie Oscar. Crowe was also critically acclaimed for his portrayal of the fictional character Captain Jack Aubrey.
Crowe has been generous with his fortune. He has donated money to several causes in his home country of New Zealand, Australia, and in the United States.",C1
"The controversial auction of a Banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north London shop in mysterious circumstances was dramatically halted just moments before it was due to go under the hammer. 
Slave Labour, a spray-painted artwork depicting a child making Union Flag bunting and seen as a critical social commentary on last year's diamond jubilee, was expected to sell for about $700,000 in a sale of street and contemporary art in Florida. 
But auctioneer Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house, who had refused all week to divulge the identity of the seller or how it came to be listed for sale through his gallery, announced that the piece, along with a second work by the secretive British street artist, had been withdrawn. 
He would not give a reason, but community leaders in Haringey, who led a vocal campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was prised from the wall of a Poundland in Wood Green, were jubilant. 
""One of our two demands was that it doesn't sell and the other was that we get it back again, so we're halfway there,"" said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor. 
""I will be writing to the auction house as a matter of urgency to clarify what happened and what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that because of the pressure and the strong views of the people of Wood Green, a community campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It's a real victory for the people."" 
Claire Kober, Leader of Haringey Council, wrote to Arts Council England and the Mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to ask them to intervene to stop the sale but it appears the decision to withdraw the item came from the gallery owners in consultation with their lawyers. The FBI refused to confirm reports they were asked to investigate. 
Several hours after the conclusion of the auction, the auction house issued a brief statement claiming it had persuaded the owners of the two Banksys to pull them from the sale. ""Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy, FAAM convinced its sellers to withdraw these lots from the auction."" 
About 30 potential buyers attended the sale of 106 lots listed in the catalogue for the modern, contemporary and street art sale in Miami's trendy Wynwood neighbourhood. The three-hour auction continued with other early lots selling in excess of their asking prices. 
Critics have accused the auction house of dealing in stolen property but Thut insisted earlier in the week that the seller, who he described as a ""well known collector "", was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal. 
He added that his gallery had been inundated with emails and phone calls from the UK, saying that many of them were abusive or offensive, but said he supported the inclusion of the pieces in the sale because it would preserve them. 
The second Banksy due to be auctioned, a 2007 artwork entitled Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to $800,000, disappeared from the auction house's online catalogue at lunchtime on Saturday, but Slave Labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time. 
Thut said the two pieces, supplied to him by separate owners, neither of them British, were important works in the street art scene and deserved buyers ""whose first interest is in art and its preservation "". 
He said he would maintain the privacy of the collector who put it up for sale. ""We respect our clients and their confidentiality. It's not our decision to have [the Banksy] returned. We only sell it. We do not have control of it."" 
A spokesperson for Poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft slab from the side of the shop it rents in Turnpike Lane. Lawyers for the owner of the building, a company called Wood Green Investments Ltd, have refused to confirm if it had anything to do with the episode. 
Banksy himself has not commented on the Slave Labour furore, but has previously condemned those who have tried to sell his artwork, speaking out before the proposed sale of five of his pieces at a 2011 auction in New York. None found a buyer. 
Stephan Keszler, the dealer behind that auction, believes selling Banksy's works without his permission is legitimate. 
""He does something on other people's property without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,"" Keszler said.

"Brazil's latest funk sensation, Anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour. 
Anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry's fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middle- class market. 
The controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anitta's skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner. 
In the first, when she was relatively unknown, she looked darker. In the second - a marketing shot after she became famous - she seems paler. Whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or - more likely - Photoshop tweaks, the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in Brazil. 
Jarid Arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anitta's image change represented. ""People refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. The whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesn't support diversity. White is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that."" 
Born Larissa de Macedo Machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. In her teens, she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiro's baile funk scene as a dancer and singer. 
She has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas , which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views. 
Though adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes, her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on Rio's hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below. 
She has toned down the suggestive dancing, gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. Now, however, questions are being asked about whether she - or her marketing team - have gone too far in re-tailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic. ""If pop stars have curly hair, they are going to feel coerced into straightening it. If they have a big nose, they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty,"" said Arraes. ""It creates a vicious cycle for self-esteem."" 
This is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. Brazil - one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery - has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and ancestry are less important here than colour. And, despite the nation's goal of being a multiracial democracy, there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality. 
In Brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of African descent. Up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average. 
The government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action. But the gulf remains glaringly apparent. The vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. Walk through Ipanema, Gavea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child. 
Defining colour is complex. People who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. Among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were ""pardu"" (mixed race), 15 million black, two million Asian and 0.5% indigenous. 
Sylvio Ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone. 
""Was this achieved by racial whitening? No,"" he said. ""What happened was a change of the social space where Anitta produced her art: from the periphery to the centre."" 
Others agree that the issue of colour is overblown. Maycon de Mattos Batista, a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in Anitta's image, but not of her colour. 
""I don't believe it's whitening; it's more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,"" he said. ""I don't think that was because of pressure being put on her. She always liked to show off, sing and dance. That was a natural thing for her. I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today."" 
Leandro Silva de Souza, a racial equality activist in the north-eastern city of Salvador, said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives. The public, he said, proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing Ellen Oleria - a black lesbian - as the recent winner of the talent show The Voice Brazil . 
The Guardian was unable to reach Anitta for comment. But, in a recent interview, she described the need for identity to be self-defined. 
""All-powerful is a woman who doesn't need to be beautiful, but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous, she is powerful. What I try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want.""

"Although much of his work, and arguably nearly all the best of it, was firmly within the discipline of the blues, BB King was always open-minded and interested when he found himself in other settings, bridging musical and cultural differences with affability and skill. Perhaps it is premature to speak of ""the last of the bluesmen"" but it is hard to imagine any future blues artist matching King's influence over musicians by the thousand and audiences by the million in a career spanning 65 years. 
Riley B King (the B did not seem to stand for a name) was born near Itta Bena, Mississippi and grew up with the limited prospects of an African-American agricultural worker, a barrier he gradually worked to overcome as he learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and honed his singing with a quartet of gospel singers. In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis. 
Within a couple of years, he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis, Arkansas. He also became a disc jockey, presenting a show on a Memphis radio station. His billing, ""The Beale Street Blues Boy"", was shortened to ""Blues Boy King"" and thence to ""BB"". After a single session in 1949 for a Nashville label, King began recording for the West Coast-based Modern Records in 1950. 
He had his first hit in 1952, with a dramatic rearrangement of Three O'Clock Blues, which topped the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the first of a list of successes such as Please Love Me, You Upset Me Baby and Sweet Sixteen . On these and his dozens of other recordings, most of them his own compositions, King developed a style that was both innovative and rooted in blues history. He was always ready to praise the musicians who had influenced him and would usually mention T-Bone Walker first. 
""I've tried my best to get that sound,"" he told the Guitar Player magazine. ""I came pretty close but never quite got it."" In an interview in 2001, he said: ""If T-Bone Walker had been a woman I would have asked him to marry me."" But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. 
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: ""I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White. I loved that sound but just couldn't do it."" He was similarly self-deprecating about his singing, a sumptuous blend of honey and lemon, mixed half-and-half from crooners such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton. Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan, whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll. 
Throughout the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist on the circuit of black-patronized theatres and clubs on an interminable series of one-nighters. In 1956, he is supposed to have filled 342 engagements. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC, but the first records under that contract, which tried to reshape him as a mainstream pop singer, were as unsatisfactory to his admirers as they were to ABC's accountants. 
The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, proved the durability of King's blues repertoire and has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians. He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss , and, in 1969, he hit the upper reaches of the pop charts - where no blues artist had been for many years - with The Thrill Is Gone . 
It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience, for whom the blues was largely defined by the Chicago school of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him. ""About a year and a half ago,"" he said in 1969, ""all of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, 'You're the greatest blues guitarist in the world.' And I'd say, 'Who told you that?' And they'd say, 'Mike Bloomfield' or 'Eric Clapton'. It's to these youngsters that I owe my new popularity."" He acquired further rock credibility with the 1970 album Indianola Mississippi Seeds, on which he collaborated with Carole King and Joe Walsh. 
From then on, King was firmly established as ""the chairman of the board of blues singers"". Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he embarked on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, experiences that led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes. 
In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but not so much that his followers outside the US could not catch up with him every year or two. Though he would now deliver most of his act seated, the strength of his singing and the fluency of his playing were only very gradually diminished. The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a ""farewell tour"" that proved not to be a farewell at all. 
In 2009, King received a Grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where the US President, Barack Obama, joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King was twice married and twice divorced. He is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others predeceased him.

"Hillary Clinton sounded a populist tone in a fiery campaign appearance Wednesday, as she continued to unveil a political message ahead of the midterm elections.
 The other side has done everything it can to divide you, she told several thousand raucous fans in Louisville. This election is about the future. 
Clinton's speech comes as the former secretary of state moves back into the political sphere with a series of rallies for Democrats up this midterm cycle. On Wednesday, she rallied supporters of Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a high-profile race.
 Let's put another crack in the glass ceiling, and elect this incredible young woman to the United States Senate, Clinton exhorted the cheering audience.
Clinton criticized McConnell and politicians in Washington for causing gridlock and slowing economic growth, and she lamented the avalanche of money outside groups are dumping into the midterm elections.
She urged Kentuckians to send a new voice to the Senate.
Some of her biggest applause lines centered on pocketbook issues such as raising the minimum wage and equal pay.
 Is n't it amazing that it's 2014, and we are still debating whether women deserve equal pay for equal work ? she asked. If there's only one reason that will motivate you to go vote in the next 20 days, put that at the top of the list. 
Clinton's visit to Kentucky comes a day after the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it would stop running ads in support of Grimes.
On Thursday, Clinton heads to Michigan to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer.

"Sometimes life just isn't fair. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated $48bn. James Goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day - the cash machine - but it didn't make him rich. In fact, he earned just GBP10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since. 
""You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting GBP1m bonuses. I wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than I did to merit a GBP1m bonus. It doesn't make much sense to me but that's the way of the world,"" Goodfellow says. 
It also annoys him that he's not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers. He came up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds ""and I got nothing, so who's going to want to follow in James Goodfellow's footsteps and get GBP10 if they have a fantastic success?"" 
There have been arguments for years over who should officially go down in history as ""the inventor of the ATM"" and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour for services to banking as the ""inventor of the automatic cash dispenser"". But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM - so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history is now assured. 
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. ""Most people working during the week couldn't get to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer,"" he recalls. ""I set out to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identification number] and an associated coded token."" 
This token took the form of a plastic card with holes punched in it. The patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated: ""When the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system, he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten push-buttons in accordance with his personal identification number."" 
Aside from the cards with punched holes, that pretty much describes today's ATM. After Goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model, prototypes were built and the first machines were installed in 1967. 
At around the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival cash-dispensing device. His machine didn't use plastic cards - instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. The machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash. 
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the ""world's first"" when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the first one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967 - a month before Goodfellow's ATM made its public debut. However, the patent for Goodfellow's machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service. 
The rivalry between the two men bubbled up when Shepherd-Barron received an official honour for his achievement. Goodfellow says: ""My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005. This honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss."" Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive to put his case but, in a 2005 interview, he was fairly withering about his rival: ""I don't know him but it's clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it. His invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant failure."" 
The cash machine has become a world-conquering piece of technology and nothing - the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc - seems to be slowing its growth: there are now 3m ATMs worldwide, with the number forecast to hit 4m by 2020. 
Goodfellow accepts he didn't invent the concept of a cash-issuing machine ""but I did invent a way of doing it. When people talk about the Wright brothers, they didn't invent the concept of flying - everyone was trying to do it - but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so I think I should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser."" 
The good news for Goodfellow is that this is now starting to happen. The website ATMInventor.com concludes: ""Who invented the idea of an ATM? We believe it was Luther George Simjian. Who invented the ATM as we know it? We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today? We think it was John D White for Docutel in the US."" 
Even better for Goodfellow, his achievement has been officially recognized in the latest edition of a 180-page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom. In the section about ""great British inventions of the twentieth century "", it states: ""In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or 'cashpoint'."" 
So after all these years, Goodfellow finally finds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web). Asked what he did with the GBP10 he received back in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out, adding: ""It didn't change my life."" But, he concludes, it's been a good working life: ""I was very happy doing the job I was doing.""

"Immigration in the United States is a complicated and controversial issue. Since the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the U.S. without proper legal status. While some people call immigrants who come and stay in the U.S. without the proper papers ""illegals"", many consider this term offensive. The more acceptable term is ""undocumented"" since they do not have the correct legal documents.
 
It is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be undocumented in the U.S., there are limits on the number of Green Cards, or legal permanent resident cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries, to apply for legal status in the U.S. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas, or permits, for people coming into the U.S. with manual labor skills. Millions of undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin under President Obama.
In 2013, the U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on by Congress. Because of this, many are asking President Obama to take action to protect some of the undocumented, many of whom have been in the U.S. for many years and have children that are U.S. citizens.",C1
"More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars.
 The fusion of Europe's economic ties, he said, would compel its nations to fuse their sovereignty as well into that of a single European state. 
To the Frenchman, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the bloc's newfound stability.
A collection of like-minded countries whose shared goals were so clear they would willingly surrender their own governments for the group's greater good.
That was 1952. A time when the future held great promise after the horrors of the past and anything seemed possible -- even creating a new pseudo country. A place now known as the European Union.
Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly is n't the set of united states Monnet hoped for. Ones with the same deep-seated convictions and beliefs.
The glue holding their common ideologies together came unstuck with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Since then, a crisis among countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds. Ironically, instead of bringing nations together, their finances have threatened to tear them apart.
This leaves us with one fundamental question: if the EU's main task is no longer to provide peace, and it ca n't guarantee prosperity either, then what should its role be ?
Born from the ashes of Europe's turbulent past, the EU has accomplished much for its members.
It has taught its citizens value of compromise over violence, providing protection and strength in numbers.
It has boosted prosperity, thanks to the free flow of goods and labor brought about by the single market, while consumer and workersrights have been reinforced and their health improved thanks to bans on smoking.
But the EU has also drifted far from its original concept, its ranks swollen by a massive Brussels-based bureaucratic machine which, critics say, is stifling industry and is pushing members like the UK towards the exit door.
The bloc's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, stretching the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision.
The EU faces a constant challenge living up to the expectations of its citizens and without two-tier policies it has no hope of serving both the bloc's strong and weak economies alike.
The EU needs a new vision a new project its people can feel passionate about.
And where better to start then this week's pivotal parliamentary elections.

"To a master traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport. ""The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader,"" Pittman says. He continues, explaining that the converse is also true. ""An island is our canoe, the community are the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the navigators. On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life."" 
It has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the flotilla of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress. Tua's journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September. The first leg took the islanders to Samoa, then Fiji, Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast, before heading south to Sydney. Around 100 crew members were involved in the various stages of the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. Unfortunately, said Tua, the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach Australia in time for the Congress. 
The official title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Office and five Pacific Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji. The main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile (11,000km) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress. 
In part, the message said: ""We see the signs of overexploitation. We no longer see the fish and other marine creatures in the size, diversity or abundance of the past. We witness the change as foreign fishing fleets ply our waters in a race to strip our resources. Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing. Our ocean is vast but not limitless. Growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life."" 
In spite of the effort and urgency behind the Pacific Islanders' message to the delegates of the Congress, much of the final days of the marine part of the Congress were taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. According to the IUCN, as of 2013, the amount of the world's oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is 'no take'. This was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last World Parks Congress held in South Africa in 2003. 
World-leading marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts from the University of York was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003. But he said it was not enough. ""The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33%. New research strengthens the case for the 30% target set previously to now be raised. Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans."" 
After difficult negotiations, the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management. Instead of the 20-30% aspirational target, the IUCN's new official position is to ""urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and well-connected systems of MPAs [marine protected areas] or other effective conservation measures by 2030; these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 30% of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services."" 
Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planet's oceans had passed the Congress. ""It's just like a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard. To hear they made that resolution is fantastic. It's a step in the right direction."" He says that, while much of the traditional navigational aids were things such as the sun, moon and stars that never changed and would, at least on a human scale, always be there, other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the Pacific. 
He said he was 55 and, in his lifetime, he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch fish on the open ocean. He also said that pollution was worsening, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney. And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Pacific Islanders. ""The decisions of the big countries have twice, thrice, four times the impact on the small countries than on developed, large nations. Many times, people don't even know where our islands are and, from the eyes of a traditional navigator, our people have a very, very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes."" 
The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking, said Tua. Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted. The leaders of wealthy countries, he went on, need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize their vessels are mere specks in an enormous sea. Most importantly, and spoken like a true navigator, Tua says politicians must seek a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to befall the small island nations. ""The world needs to find a different path.""

"A
Thanks to the field of linguistics we know much about the development of the 5,000 plus languages in existence today. We can describe their grammar and pronunciation and see how their spoken and written forms have changed over time. For example, we understand the origins of the Indo-European group of languages, which includes Norwegian, Hindi and English, and can trace them back to tribes in eastern Europe in about 3000 BC.
So, we have mapped out a great deal of the history of language, but there are still areas we know little about. Experts are beginning to look to the field of evolutionary biology to find out how the human species developed to be able to use language. So far, there are far more questions and half-theories than answers.
B
We know that human language is far more complex than that of even our nearest and most intelligent relatives like chimpanzees. We can express complex thoughts, convey subtle emotions and communicate about abstract concepts such as past and future. And we do this following a set of structural rules, known as grammar. Do only humans use an innate system of rules to govern the order of words? Perhaps not, as some research may suggest dolphins share this capability because they are able to recognise when these rules are broken.
C
If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.
D
Another question is, what is it about human brains that allowed language to evolve in a way that it did not in other primates? At some point, our brains became able to make our mouths produce vowel and consonant sounds, and we developed the capacity to invent words to name things around us. These were the basic ingredients for complex language. The next change would have been to put those words into sentences, similar to the 'protolanguage' children use when they first learn to speak. No one knows if the next step - adding grammar to signal past, present and future, for example, or plurals and relative clauses - required a further development in the human brain or was simply a response to our increasingly civilised way of living together.
Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, though, we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation, through cave paintings for example; no one knows the connection between this and language. Brains didn't suddenly get bigger, yet humans did become more complex and more intelligent. Was it using language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start producing language?
E
More questions lie in looking at the influence of genetics on brain and language development. Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",C1
"They are the darkness seekers - and they are growing in number. On Black Fell, looking down on Northumberland's beautiful Kielder Water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. This is Kielder Observatory, the centre of Britain's nascent astrotourism industry. And those waiting outside were the lucky ones. Many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited. 
Inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory's founder and lead astronomer, Gary Fildes, a former bricklayer with Tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. The team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but Fildes is doubtful. Instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse. An additional attraction is the appearance of the International Space Station. 
""Remember,"" Fildes tells his team, ""it's about interaction, it's about entertainment, it's about inspiring people."" He puts on some music. Pink Floyd, the Jam, the Pogues. ""By 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,"" Fildes says. ""It's going to be epic."" 
Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UK's burgeoning astrotourism industry. The pivotal moment for Northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing Hadrian's Wall, along with Kielder Water and Forest Park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded Dark Sky Park status, the only one in England. Dark Sky Parks are rare. The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a good night. 
The Tucson, Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. Recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth. 
Duncan Wise, visitor development officer for the Northumberland National Park Authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the Council for the Protection of Rural England found it was one of Britain's most tranquil places. ""We tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,"" Wise said. ""But what about what's above it?"" Wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the IDA, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks' bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area. 
Their efforts have been vindicated. Many of the 1.5 million who visit Northumberland each year are now aware of its Dark Sky status. ""We get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,"" says the man at the car-hire firm in Newcastle. ""They come in autumn and winter, when it's darkest. Good for the B&Bs as they get business all year round now."" Local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. Those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are ""Dark Sky Friendly"". 
Wise acknowledges that Northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. A GBP14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north's answer to the Eden Project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years. 
Fildes has grand designs. He is planning Britain's first ""astrovillage"", one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. The multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. Fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018. 
However, Northumberland faces competition. Galloway Forest Park in Scotland also has Dark Sky Park status. Since Exmoor was designated Europe's first International Dark Sky Reserve - one notch below Dark Sky Park - in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. The UK will have to go some way to eclipse northern Chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. The Teide National Park in Tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination. 
So, what is driving the desire to look upwards? The media have helped. TV presenters like Brian Cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. ""Brian Cox has made astronomy accessible,"" says Wise. ""It's no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes."" Technology has also played a part. Apps such as Stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. Ultimately, though, Fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. ""If you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?""

"Organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date. The international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same benefits as adding one or two portions of the recommended 'five a day'. 
The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert at Newcastle University, concludes that there are ""statistically significant, meaningful"" differences, with a range of antioxidants being ""substantially higher"" - between 19% and 69% - in organic food. It is the first study to demonstrate clear and wide-ranging differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals. 
The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to ""one to two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these compounds to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and wholegrain consumption is confirmed"". 
The findings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people, with one expert saying that the findings were exaggerated. Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at King's College London, said the research did show some differences. ""But the question is are they within natural variation? And are they nutritionally relevant? I am not convinced."" He said Leifert's work had caused controversy in the past. ""Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people."" Sanders added the research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops. 
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world - more than ever before - which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. ""The crucially important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,"" said Helen Browning, chief executive of the Soil Association, which campaigns for organic farming. 
Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to fight back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays. But, the scientists say other reasons may be important, such as organic varieties being bred for toughness and not being overfed with artificial fertilizers. 
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants ""have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers"". But, they also note that no long-term studies showing health benefits from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted. The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. Pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food. The research was funded by the EU and an organic farming charity. 
The research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work skews the results, although the team did ""sensitivity analyses"" and found that excluding weaker work did not significantly change the outcome. Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits. But, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops. 
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences. The greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of potential health benefits. The most recent major analysis, which took in 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. ""The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods,"" it found. 
This was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scientific journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency, though the latter considered just 11 studies. The 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. Sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. ""You are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food,"" he said. ""What is most important is what you eat, not whether it's organic or conventional. It's whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all. People are buying into a lifestyle system. They get an assurance it is not being grown with chemicals and is not grown by big business."" 
Opinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons cited by shoppers for buying organic produce. But, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, as is taste (35%). Browning said: ""This research backs up what people think about organic food. In other countries, there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and farming. We hope these findings will bring the UK into line with the rest of Europe.""

"From choosing the right festival to tips on camping and pacing yourself through the shows, here's -LRB- almost -RRB- everything you 'll need to know about preparing for your next music festival.
When I went to my first summer musical festival a few years back, I was unprepared and could 've used a little guidance. Since then, I 've covered Lollapalooza, Pitchfork Music Festival, moe.down and other summer festivals, acquiring along the way a checklist of sorts that I wish I 'd had before embarking on that first one.
Seasoned veteran or festival novice, I hope these tips will make your experience more rocking, relaxing and fun.
Find the right festival for you
One of the best places to start is Jambase.com, an aggregator of all things related to music festivals and concerts. Check out the history of each particular festival via its website or third-party music blogs/sites.
Each festival tries to set itself apart, creating a specific slant through lineup, location and overall vibe. Generally, festivals will be teaming up with local and regional media and artists to offer unique side shows ranging from improv theater to art exhibits to on-site record stores and activist booths promoting voter registration and green initiatives.

As you do your research, ask yourself the following four questions:
1. How much can you spend ?
Festival passes range from $50 to $250 or higher, depending on venue, location and who's headlining and promoting the festival.
2. What type of music do you want to hear ?
Musical tastes are pretty diverse these days, as most people enjoy several genres, and festival lineups reflect this. Though some are genre-exclusive, most showcase acts playing everything from bluegrass to hip hop.
3. Are you prepared to camp ?
For festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella, much of the experience is about pitching your tent and camping out for the weekend. Some camping events do offer luxury cabins or tents in return for higher ticket prices.
Cover story: What is Bonnaroo ?
Most festivals provide maps pre-arrival, so you 'll want to know where the camping areas are in relation to the parking and stages. If the distance is far, try to keep your gear light or invest in a small pull wagon or cart.
Depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action -LRB- many festivals run 24 hours -RRB-, you 'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages, scattered across the grounds, or both.
Bring the usual camping gear -- tent, sleeping bag, etc. -- and do n't forget a car charger for your phone, laptop and other gadgets.
The world's best music festivals
4. Are hotels an option ?
If you 're attending a festival located in a city or metropolitan area, such as Pitchfork in Chicago, getting a hotel room for the weekend on your own is an option, or you can take advantage of the festival's package lodging deals.
Learn the local history before you go
As with all travel, having a cultural awareness of where you 're going can enrich your festival experience and take you beyond simple enjoyment of the music. The uniqueness of many of the best festivals is rooted in their locality. For example, Glastonbury in the UK is held on festival grounds that have been used as such for centuries.
Being clued in on local culture and history will also help if you plan on venturing away during the show to give your ears a rest or want to take a pre - or post-festival excursion to visit nearby attractions.
Stretch your comfort zone
One of the best parts about the summer music festival experience is observing the meshing of different cultures and being around new groups of people. As more and more festivals incorporate different genres, I 've seen an increasingly diverse cross-section of fans at festivals.
Take the opportunity to interact with other festival-goers, and do n't be afraid to ask for that camping tool you forgot. Chat about last night's set or join in a game of Frisbee.

Be smart about drugs and alcohol
I do n't include this tip to be a killjoy, but only as a word of caution. I 've seen festival experiences come to an early and nightmarish end as a result of irresponsible drug and alcohol use.
It's a fact that music culture and drug culture overlap, especially in a live-music setting, but be wise about bringing drugs or large amounts of booze with you. At most festivals, you 're going to be thoroughly searched before you even get though the gates. Security will either confiscate prohibited materials or ask you to leave with no ticket refunds.

Make time to chill
One of the biggest lessons I 've learned is to plan out a few intervals of rest and not run myself ragged trying to see every band. If you 've done initial research on the area, take a short trek to one of the quiet spots you learned about and give your cochleas a break.
Many festivals have also begun featuring morning yoga classes, a great chance to recharge the mind and body.
I ca n't stress this enough: however you do it, whether it's reading a book, taking a nap, or journaling in a quiet spot, make time to give your ears and other senses a rest. Knowing the festival ground layout and scheduling in time to relax is the most important tip I can give.

"Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, has likened the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by international terrorism. While this might sound like an exaggeration, the threat was actually, if anything, understated. Each year, the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks. 
While it is difficult to track the global impact of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial species, the World Health Organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multi-drug resistance accounts for more than 150,000 deaths each year. Antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk: this is now a war. 
In the past hundred years, our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition. At the beginning of the twentieth century, life expectancy in the UK stood at around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman, a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days. Around a third of all deaths occurred in children under the age of five, largely because of infectious disease. 
In contrast, a child born in Britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday. For this we have public health systems, vaccination and antibiotics to thank. It is by these means - the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms - that the real war against disease is principally won. 
Elsewhere, we have pushed the limits of survival, notably in intensive care. This, the specialism in which I chose to train, is where antibiotic resistant organisms are most prevalent. Here, powerful antibiotics, essential in the treatment of life-threatening illness, are used routinely. These drugs decimate ordinary bacteria. But what they leave behind are hardy species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotic drugs. 
As a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s, I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus - the infamous MRSA - a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins. In the fight against it, there were a handful of exotic-sounding drugs - vancomycin and teicoplanin among them. These were supposed to be our last lines of defence, but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common; as did species with new patterns of resistance. Drugs we had previously barely heard of became commonplace. New last-line drugs emerged to replace the old. We got used to this state of affairs; a steady escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria. 
But the balance has been shifting steadily. In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease, using them too often and too indiscriminately. And some of the worst abuses have occurred outside of healthcare, with antibiotics introduced into the food chain, through agriculture and the lacing of livestock feed with anti-bacterial drugs. We assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever. We became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game. 
But this is no longer the case. New, more resistant species have been identified. The vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat MRSA infection was defeated. Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) emerged in our hospitals. And other bacterial species were learning the same trick. Enterobacteria, organisms usually found in the gut, had also acquired vancomycin resistance. Today, infections with formidable, highly resistant organisms are commonplace and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace. Fewer and fewer new anti-microbial drugs are emerging from their production lines. It is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new drugs active against resistant strains. For every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent, bacteria rapidly evolve a defence. All of the simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted. 
Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop, that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry's incentive to manufacture new drugs that can fight them is low. 
Almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the 1940s, the first evidence of bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged. Initially, these were little more than curiosities. When they did infect patients, the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to warrant much attention. But today, they have become a fact of medical life. Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight. 
Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise healthy children in the US in 1998, the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has risen to tens of thousands - outstripping the number of deaths caused by AIDS. Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look. This is a war like no other. There needs to be cultural change in our prescribing behaviours and more restraint in the use of antibiotics in farming and agriculture. And somehow, the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs. 
Within my working lifetime, the pattern of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has transformed from a rare but notable event to a problem of epidemic proportion. If we are to avoid a return to the pre-antibiotic time with all its excess mortality, we must be bold. To squander the advantage we have so recently gained against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable.  ",C1
"On one day in August, one in seven people on Earth, 1 billion people, used Facebook, according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. In a decade, the social network has transformed people's relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped topple regimes and even changed the meanings of everyday words. 
""A more open and connected world is a better world. 
It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that reflects all of our values,"" wrote Zuckerberg in the post announcing the numbers. These are just some of the ways his company changed everything - for better or worse. 
1 Facebook has changed the definition of ""friend""
""To friend"" is now a verb. And, unlike in real life, when the ending of a friendship can be deeply traumatic, it is easy to ""unfriend"", a word invented to describe ditching a casual acquaintance when they are no longer enhancing your Facebook newsfeed. Although the meanings of the words ""share"" and ""like"" are essentially the same, Facebook has brought an entirely new weight to the terms. School and university reunions have become redundant - you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and you've seen endless pictures of your schoolmates' babies. You won't be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know they're dating someone else from the romantic selfies. 
But, unlike in real life, Facebook has no hierarchy of friendships. A classmate from one project at university who you haven't seen in 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a stag do or a colleague you've never actually spoken to in person - they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest mate or your spouse or your mum. 
It doesn't necessarily mean we see them the same way. Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasn't changed that yet, he believes, but, in an interview with the New Yorker, Dunbar said he feared it was so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that, eventually, there may no longer be any need to learn to get along. 
2 We care less about privacy 
There's a wise saying: if you're not paying for it, you're the product. Facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it. The astonishing thing is that users know that and they willingly hand over that information. 
Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. 
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a fifth give their phone number. But, as so much of a person's life is shared online, Facebook gives a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fanbase. In an article for the journal Frontiers in Psychology, academics described a new phenomenon, the emergence of the ""Facebook self "". More than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively. But most younger users do restrict their profiles, with 60% allowing friends only. 
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs - but not in its own offices 
Facebook has essentially created an entire sector, including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand. 
""It is a tool like no other,"" said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft. ""Marketers have an understanding of a brand's consumers like they have never had before. The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand."" 
And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported ad revenue was up 46%, reaching $3.32bn. Facebook is also a minefield for brands. Suddenly, rather than complaint conversations taking place over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum, angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal fans of the brand have been carefully cultivated. And an injustice can go viral. 
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions 
Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook. Manchester University's Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine. Facebook posts signalled the start of the Maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that Ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the EU, Onuch found. The posts organized live action, not just online anger. Mustafa Nayyem, the Ukraine activist, posted: ""If you really want to do something, don't just 'like' this post. Let's meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the Maidan."" 
Many of those interviewed in Onuch's research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening - unable to trust traditional media. 
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news 
Roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government. 
Most people will first encounter a piece of journalism or an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media, and most of those encounters will be on mobiles. 
Users might never have to leave the site to get their news: Instant Articles will see stories run within Facebook. It allows news companies to sell ads around their articles, gaining them 100% of that revenue, while Facebook can also sell ads around that article, with 70% of the revenue from the social network's advertising also going to the news companies. 
Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. For better or (often) worse, it is a directory to find, contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly find themselves at the centre of the day's biggest news story. Facebook has its own newswire, sharing the most useful user reaction to breaking stories, including pictures and videos. 
6 Users are changing Facebook 
It used to be a site to get students connected, with only elite US universities allowed access. 
In 2014, a decade after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account. And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person. 
Groups have given way to pages, writing on each other's walls is passe and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile uploads. More than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet. 
We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect . ""It might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Facebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.""

"On June 17, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson explained to The New York Times reporter James Scotty Reston why he had to stay the course in Vietnam by stabilizing the South Vietnamese government so that it could fight communism.
Johnson rejected calls for withdrawal that were being made by liberal Democrats as well as the proposal for neutralization promoted by France's Charles de Gaulle.
 So the only thing you 've got left, Johnson said, is try to make this thing more efficient and more effective and hold as strong as you can and keep this government as stable as you can and try to improve it as you can and that we 're doing day and night. 
During his recent speech at West Point, President Obama rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about Afghanistan. The president, saying that the comparison with Vietnam relies on a false reading of history, pointed to three differences.
The first is that the U.S. is now part of a broad international coalition. The second is that in Vietnam the U.S. faced a broad-based popular insurgency whereas today, according to most polls, a large number of Afghans support foreign assistance. Last, Obama added, is that today Americans are responding to a very real threat that began with the vicious attack on 9/11.
Clearly, Obama feels defensive about this analogy and hopes to undercut liberal critics who are frustrated and disappointed with his decision.
In trying to separate himself from the experience of Johnson, however, Obama did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently, and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today.
Mark Twain once said that history does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. Most of those who have compared Afghanistan to Vietnam do not say that the situations were exactly the same politically or strategically. Nor is it inevitable that the surge in Afghanistan will be unsuccessful.
The point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that Obama faces similar challenges, as did Johnson when the Americanization of Vietnam began in the spring of 1965.
Both presidents entered the war despite the fact that many top advisers in the White House and in Congress were strongly warning against escalation.
In 1964, Johnson heard from voices ranging from Idaho liberal Frank Church to Georgia hawk Richard Russell that Vietnam was not critical to fighting communism and that the war was unwinnable. Their warnings proved to be accurate. Going into this decision, Obama heard comparable criticism as well.
Both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda. Johnson was much further ahead of the game when he increased the number of ground troops in the war that he inherited. The war devastated Johnson's domestic efforts. Obama faces the same threat.
Both wars have been justified as wars of necessity. With Vietnam, proponents warned that the fall of Southeast Asia to communism would vastly strengthen the Soviet Union and China.
In an era when American schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made the war seem essential. Today, the necessity stems from the claim that failure would resurrect the dangers we faced before 9/11.
And both presidents escalated wars where the path to victory and the potential costs -- in terms of human capital and budgetary obligations -- were unclear.
Despite the fact that Johnson confronted a very different kind of enemy, the risk today is enormously high. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous, as the Soviets learned in the 1980s and the U.S. has learned since 2001. The U.S. is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in Afghanistan.
While the promise of withdrawal in July 2011 might be accurate, presidential assurances of benchmarks and end games historically do n't come true. The one constant in warfare is that it is unpredictable and difficult to control. One day after Obama's speech, Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that the deadline was not firm.
And the administration might very well be handcuffing itself to a strategy of more warfare as it keeps offering grave warnings about what a victory by the Taliban would mean.
These warnings will make it difficult in the long run for the administration to contain the operation or to withdraw forces unless it is absolutely clear that the Taliban has been defeated.
Democrats could find themselves feeling like their predecessors in the 1950s who were under political pressure to abide by the containment arguments outlined by President Harry Truman with the Truman Doctrine in 1947 -- first with Korea in 1950 and then with Vietnam.
Obama should not be so defensive about the comparisons with Vietnam. Rather, he should use Johnson's experience to help guide him as he makes crucial decisions in the months ahead and attempts to navigate the challenges of the wartime presidency.
In a conversation with a few of his closest advisers, Johnson said in 1964 that It's damned easy to get in a war but it's gon na be awfully hard to ever extricate yourself if you get in. 
In 1965, Johnson made the mistake of excluding those who were trying to warn him about the dangers of the war. Let's hope that this time around Obama does not repeat this error.

"Swimming superstar Michael Phelps once claimed he scoffed up to 12,000 calories a day. Usain Bolt's big sprint rival Yohan Blake says he chomps 16 ripe bananas every 24 hours.
A tiny Japanese athlete easily tucked away 50 pieces of sushi after training, while another marathon runner gobbled plates of raw mince.
Or how about the weightlifter who drinks the first milk of a cow that has just given birth ?
With extreme eating habits like these, it may be some surprise to learn that within the Olympic Village there lurks a culinary trap that can potentially tip athletes over the fine line between success and failure at London 2012.
Competitors spend years honing their bodies to perfection, scrupulously eating the right foods, avoiding the wrong ones... and then ?
They encounter the Olympic Dining Hall.
With a McDonald's at one end and machines dispensing other sponsorssoft drinks and confectionery, the giant eating area provides mountains of fodder from around the world -- a full gamut of gluttony from one extreme of the health spectrum to the other.
Cooking for an Olympic champ: A recipe for success
It's a 5,000-capacity, 24-hour facility where organizers expect 25,000 loaves of bread, 232 tons of potatoes, 75,000 liters of milk and more than 330 tons of fruit and vegetables to be consumed by the time the Games finish on August 12.
Some 1.2 million meals will be served -- 60,000 a day.
 For the younger athletes it's an exciting new experience, says sports scientist Jess Corones, who works with the Australian Olympic swim team.
 It's all free. There's thousands of athletes and there's pretty much every kind of cuisine that you could possibly want. There's a stand that gives you unlimited McDonald's, there's machines that pump out unlimited amounts of soft drinks for you.
 That's exciting and it can be a distraction for them. They think, Oh this is so cool,and they just run to it -- but you have to remind them that it 'll still be there when they 've finished competing and that until they 've finished competing they 've got to stay on their normal routine. 
What passes for normal can vary wildly.
Phelps, after winning a record eight gold medals at Beijing 2008, told NBC that he gorged on carbohydrate-heavy pasta and pizza at the height of his extreme training. Jamaica's 100-meter world champion Blake says he eats so many bananas to keep up his potassium levels.
British weightlifter Jake Oliver says that every morning he drinks a shake containing colostrum -- a protein-rich form of milk produced during the late stages of cowspregnancy. I 've tried to get people to try it, but they wo n't. Just the smell of it is enough to put people off, he told UK newspaper The Guardian.
Or even Japan's former Olympic marathon champion Naoko Takahashi, a diminutive runner who told CNN she could consume about 2 kg of fish after a big session.
 I only ate twice a day. But I ate a lot, said Takahashi, who won gold at Sydney 2000 and now works in television.
British Olympian explains her ideal meals
However, it's rare for athletes to eat quite that much, says Corones, who first worked with Australia's track and field team at the 2004 Athens Games. Phelps actually admitted this year that the report of his gargantuan appetite was a myth, saying such intake would be impossible.
 I find it hard to believe, Corones said. I tell you what, if he is eating that he's got a pretty exceptional metabolism ! The only people that I 've seen eat close to that are the hammer throwers, and they all weigh in at 120 kilos. 
Corones has had some experience of quirky diets though, citing Australia's Ethiopia-born marathon runner Sisay Bezabeh from the 2004 team.
 We had our camp in Italy and all he used to eat every dinner was a bowl of raw mince. I found it quite disgusting but he needed iron for his running, and that's what he did. You would n't get many athletes doing that these days. 
Good nutrition from a young age can be vital if you want to be an elite athlete.
Becky Stevenson, a British dietitian based in the Netherlands, has researched the importance of vitamin D for improving performance and avoiding injury.
She cites reports that showed Chinese adolescent girls with adequate vitamin D had significant higher bone mass and muscle strength. Questions have been raised about teenage swimmer Ye Shiwen's incredible performances at London 2012, but such research has yet to prove that high levels of vitamin D could be a contributing factor to her success.
 We know low levels may impact muscle strength and bone turnover, but if an athlete has adequate levels there is no evidence of an enhanced benefit to performance, so natural talent and athletic ability is more likely, Stevenson told CNN.
Meanwhile, studies have shown that young athletes in northern European countries such as Britain, Finland and Germany often suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Proper levels can reduce the risk of stress fractures, inflammatory injuries and upper respiratory tract infections.
 You can get vitamin D in food sources -LRB- such as eggs, dairy and fish -RRB- but it's not as effective as sunshine production, Stevenson said.
 Those at risk are athletes training at 35 degrees or above latitude -- northern Europe, north China, North America -- as UVB rays are inadequate during the winter months from November to April.
 When we measured our elite tennis players we only found one athlete who was marginal with vitamin D, as he had been injured and was rehabbing indoors.
 There needs to be more research evidence looking at vitamin D and injury prevention -- most of the work is retrospective. 
Most athletes use supplements to bolster their dietary intake, everything from everyday vitamins such as magnesium and iron plus products such as whey protein, creatine, carnitine and branched-chain amino acids -LRB- BCAAs -RRB- specifically aimed at improving performance and recovery.
But, with drug-testing standards improving year by year and the list of banned substances also increasing, there is a strong onus for athletes to be acutely aware of everything they put in their mouth.
 Most athletes are using quite a few supplements. They live an extreme life, the amount of training they do is extreme, they exercise way outside what the normal person would do, so it is important to supplement their diet, Corones says.
 There is a very fine line and it's something that athletes need to stay on top of. The onus is 100 % on the athlete and we make that very clear to them from a young age that they are responsible for what goes in their mouth. No matter if it comes from their coach or their parents or their brother or their friend, they have to know what they 're putting in their body.
 You might trust your coach 100 % but if he gives you a bottle of tablets and tells you it's iron, it's still your responsibility to get that checked. We have hotlines where the athletes can call up and check anything, so it's pretty easy to find out if it's okay to take. 
At this stage, with the Games underway and many athletes still waiting to begin their competitions, the emphasis is on refinement as opposed to strength building.
 It varies depending on where we are in the year, says Corones, who works for the New South Wales Institute of Sport in Sydney.
 Earlier on we want them to be carrying a bit of extra weight to reduce the chances of injury and illness, but then when it gets down to racing it's stripped down to the bare minimum, she says.
 We do n't really get them to count calories, we more look at what areas of food groups they 're eating from. You 're looking at getting quality fats, making sure you get enough carbohydrates, and also the timing of the meal -- if you 're swimming or doing gym.
 If you 're doing gym there's a greater mechanical breakdown of the muscle so we need to eat more protein post the session, with a little bit pre the session. 
A big part of Coronesjob is making sure athletes learn the right food habits -- and this generally means breaking eating patterns formed at a young age.
 It's a pretty big education process for the athletes. There are still some that struggle with that concept that the less processed it is, the better it is for them, she says.
 Often early on in their careers, in their young teens, they do a lot of training and they want to grab the first thing that's quickest available because they 're always hungry after training. So they get in the habit of having a bucket of hot chips after every training session. Obviously that's not great so we try to break those habits.
 We often find that the processed foods -- with the high salt and the high sugar content in them -- that the body can crave them. It's about trying to break those cycles and get them eating as well as they can.

"Forrest Gump is a 1994 film depicting the life of a simple, Alabama-born man who achieves great success in life despite being mentally slow. The lead character is played by the great Tom Hanks, who is involved in many of the most significant moments in American history. The film and character have become iconic figures in American society because of its message that any feat can be accomplished no matter what obstacles are faced.
 
Gump was born to a single mother in rural Alabama during the 1950s. He is a slow-witted boy who seems unaware of his surroundings, or purpose in life. A school counselor tells his mother Gump's IQ is so low, and would be placed into a special vocational program. His mother convinces the counselor to disregard Gump's low IQ score. Forrest is allowed to attend a regular public school.
Because of his athletic ability, Gump gets a scholarship to play football at the University of Alabama, where he excels at the game. Upon graduation, he is approached by an army recruiter, and joins the military, where again he excels. Gump is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving the lives of many of his fellow troops during a vicious firefight in the Vietnam War.
After his time in the service, Gump wins an international ping pong competition in China, brings down President Richard Nixon while staying at the infamous, Watergate Hotel, meets three presidents, and goes on several, cross-country runs that gain massive media attention. Throughout his life, Gump maintains solid relationship with his friends from the Army, and dearly loves his only childhood friend and sweetheart, Jenny. Forrest Gump touches the American spirit like no other film ever has.",C1
"The sight of colleagues and acquaintances taking a drag on an e-cigarette has become commonplace. But have we reached ""peak vape""? Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who comprise the vast majority of vapers, may already be on the decline. The figures will be studied closely by the major e-cigarette firms, which have poured millions into promoting a technology that was thought to have been growing in popularity. 
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes - which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke - tripled from an estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014. 
However, figures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research body backed by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vaping's appeal may be waning. Vaping rates among smokers and ex-smokers rose steadily until the end of 2013, when some 22% of smokers and ex-smokers were vaping. But this proportion levelled out throughout 2014 before dropping to 19% during the final quarter of 2014. Early signs suggest the decline has continued into 2015. The drop is described as ""statistically significant"" by Professor Robert West, of UCL's Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, who collates the figures for the Toolkit. 
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette firms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers. Only around 1% of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette. ""Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down,"" West said. ""We've only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so it's a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or 'never' smokers using e-cigarettes. That is not to say vaping rates might not change but, at this stage, it looks like they're staying the same."" 
The levelling off in popularity of vaping in the UK would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity. However, West questioned the interpretation of US data, which made little distinction between people who had once tried an e-cigarette and those who regularly vaped. 
Fears that vaping could become fashionable among young non-smokers appear to be misplaced, according to experts. Only 1.8% of children are regular users, the ASH study found. Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit. ""While the figures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011,"" said James Dunworth, director and co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk. ""Our customers are still very happy with the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes."" 
""E-cigarettes are behaving like a souped-up nicotine patch,"" West agreed. ""They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective. One-third of quit attempts use e-cigarettes, which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping."" 
Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at ASH, said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked. ""Although there are indications that the market hasn't grown in the UK for about a year, there doesn't seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking. Using an electronic cigarette is safer than smoking; some, but not all, people find them useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that they are leading to an increase in young people smoking."" 
It emerged recently that the European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity. A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes to below their current levels. This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive. 
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking. ""There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors,"" he said.

"Crunchy, full of protein and to be found under a rock near you. Insects have long been overlooked as food in all but a handful of places around the world - but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates. Spring 2013 will see a drive towards removing the yuck factor and putting insects not just on experimental gastronomic menus but also on supermarket shelves. 
In April, there will be a festival in London, Pestival 2013 - a Wellcome Trust-backed insect appreciation event where the consumption of creepy-crawlies comes high on the agenda. It will feature a two-day ""pop-up "" restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab, the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma, which brought ants to the table for a sellout ten-day run at Claridge's hotel in Mayfair in 2012. 
Noma has been named the world's best restaurant by Restaurant magazine for three years running. Its chef, Rene Redzepi, says that ants taste like lemon, and a puree of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce. Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used in place of eggs and scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to use little creatures. 
In March, a BBC documentary will feature food writer Stefan Gates searching out and eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued tarantulas. But, behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup there is a deeply serious message. Many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepy-crawlies. 
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at promoting the eating and farming of insects in south-east Asia and Africa, where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet. In 2012, the FAO published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and, with sponsorship from the Dutch government plans a major international conference on ""this valuable food source"" in 2013. 
Insects are plentiful - globally, for every human there are 40 tonnes of insects - so there is not too much chance of them being endangered, and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals. ""I know it's taboo to eat bugs in the western world, but why not?"", Redzepi has said. ""You go to south-east Asia and this is a common thing. You read about it from all over the world, that people are eating bugs. If you like mushrooms, you've eaten so many worms you cannot imagine. But also we eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. Think of that next time you pour it into your tea."" 
He said that the basic premise behind Nordic Food Lab was: ""Nothing is not edible."" Insects are critical to life on Earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there. 
Over the next 30 years, the planet's human population will increase to nine billion. Already one billion people do not get enough food. The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies. 
The cost of meat is rising, not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle. There is also the issue of methane excreted by cows. The livestock farming contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous - 35% of the planet's methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide. 
Edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. They emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste. China is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms. Zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly $500,000 by the FAO to develop an insect-harvesting project. It's already big business in the UK, though not always official: a man was recently detained by Gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from Burkina Faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth nearly GBP40,000, in his luggage.  
A study by FoodServiceWarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%. But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead - then they get a chance to nibble their own back.

"The brand and logo of Apple have been named the most valuable in the world - worth nearly $119bn, or more than the entire gross domestic product of Morocco, Ecuador or Oman. 
The Silicon Valley firm, already the world's biggest company - with a stock market valuation of $591bn - has seen its brand value increase by 21% in 12 months, according to the closely followed Interbrand Best Global Brands annual report. 
Apple, which is recognized the world over by its simple ""Apple with a bite missing"" emblem, led a surge of technology companies in the 2014 report, which has pushed more traditionally valuable brands - such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Gillette - down the table. 
Google's brand value rose by 15% to $107bn to take second place, followed by Coca-Cola, up 3% to $81.5bn, IBM ($72.2bn) and Microsoft ($45.5bn). 
Facebook is the biggest riser in the chart, increasing its brand value by 86% to $14.3bn and taking 29th place in the table, ahead of longstanding global corporate names such as Volkswagen, Kellogg's and Ford. 
Jez Frampton, chief executive of Interbrand, which is part of global advertising group Omnicom, said: ""Benefitting immensely from the rise of digital and, later, mobile technology, savvy brands like Apple grew stronger. New category- killers like Google, Amazon and Facebook have reset customer expectations and significantly raised the bar for brand experiences."" 
Apple, which former Chief Executive Steve Jobs founded in his Los Altos garage in 1976, only appeared in the top ten of the Interbrand annual study in 2011. 
Its logo, created by advertising executive Rob Janoff in 1977, was designed with a bite taken out of it to avoid confusion with a cherry. ""One of the deep mysteries to me is our logo, the symbol of lust and knowledge, bitten into, all crossed with the colours of the rainbow in the wrong order. You couldn't dream of a more appropriate logo: lust, knowledge, hope and anarchy,"" Janoff said. 
Graham Hayles, Interbrand's chief marketing officer, said it was ""not out of kilter"" that Apple's brand could account for a fifth of the company's entire market value. ""Apple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand,"" he said. ""There is a very strong correlation between branding and profitability."" 
Hayles said Interbrand, which has been carrying out the annual study since 2000, calculates brand value by examining companies' financial performance, consumers' ""brand allegiance"" and ""brand-strength analysis "". 
While many technology companies rose up the chart, there were big fallers, too. Finnish mobile- phone company Nokia dropped 41 places to 98th at $4.1bn, just ahead of Nintendo in 100th place (down 33). ""They're both only just in the chart now,"" Hayles said. ""It shows the importance of getting innovation right. If you don't keep pace, it is very penalizing."" 
A Chinese company has made it into the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband firm Huawei entering the rankings in 94th place with a brand value of $4.3bn. Huawei has been partly banned by the US and Australian governments due to fears that its equipment could be used by the Chinese for cyber-espionage. 
Most of the brands in the top 100 are US-owned, the highest-placed non-US brands being South Korea's Samsung (6th), Japan's Toyota (8th) and Germany's Mercedes-Benz (10th). The highest- placed British brands are HSBC (33rd), Shell (65th) and Burberry (73rd). 
Other fashion brands in the top 100 include Boss, Prada and Ralph Lauren. Designer label Louis Vuitton is the top-ranked fashion name, in 19th position, with a value of $23bn, just ahead of high-street clothing chain H&M, with a brand value of $21bn and ranked 21. 
Sports brand Nike, ranked 22 with a brand valued at nearly $20bn, is rated way ahead of rival Adidas, at 59 in the top 100 with a value of $7bn. 
Frampton said consumers' ability to interact with and criticize brands on Twitter and other social media means companies must react faster to retain and improve their brands' reputations. 
""The customer, empowered by social media in the 'age of experience', now has more control than ever,"" he said. ""In this world of two-way conversations, advocacy, influence and engagement are the new rules for brand-building. 
""Customers expect seamless interactions, responsiveness, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization,"" he said. ""In a sense, they increasingly expect brands to know them.""

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- In 1982, songwriter San Bao fell in love with musical theater -- then an alien art form in China -- when he saw a videotaped version of CATS, which became the longest running musical in Broadway history.
Fast forward three decades, and San Bao, who has enjoyed a successful career writing pop songs and helming music production at the Beijing Olympics, wants to make home-grown musicals to rival some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's biggest hits.
 This is what I want -- a real musical with Chinese characteristics, he told CNN.
San Bao has made seven musicals since 2005 and his latest Nie Xiaoqian and Ning Caichen -- currently on tour in China -- draws on a collection of supernatural tales written during the early Qing Dynasty.
Underwritten by government funding, none of his musicals has yet made a profit, let alone smashed box-office records -- although a 2005 production called Butterflies made it to South Korean stages in a 2008 tour.
 It takes time for people to appreciate this art form, said San Bao.
 Ten years ago, nobody in China would spend money buying a movie ticket, but now ? People do n't talk about what movies they watched but about which ones they missed.

Rave reviews
Some Broadway shows have captivated Chinese audiences. French revolution epic Les Miserables was a hit when it debuted in Shanghai in 2002.
More recently, a Chinese-language version of Mamma Mia ! that toured in August 2011 grossed 20 million yuan -LRB- $3.2 million -RRB- in less than a month and according to the China Daily, a 2013 production of The Phantom of the Opera sold out five months before its premiere.
But high ticket prices mean these shows reach a limited audience, and it's typically only the most accessible Broadway hits that resonate with a Chinese audience, says Zhou Yinchen, the head of the Folk Music and Musical Research Center at Peking University's Academy of Arts.
 Mamma Mia !is entertaining, that's why Chinese accept it, she says. Of course there are other Broadway musicals but it's only those with the highest entertainment value work in China, she adds.
Nonetheless, the rave reviews audiences have given to these shows make musical producers like San Bao confident that combining Broadway showmanship with Chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure-fire hit.
Cartoon character
As well as China's imperial past, San Bao has also made shows about a Chinese cartoon character similar to Tintin, and the Chinese Communist Party's Long March -- a 6,000 mile journey that helped cement Mao Zedong's stature as a great leader.
San Bao says one of the biggest challenges he faces is the dearth of all-round performers.
Few Chinese actors and actresses have equally strong singing and dancing skills that musical theater requires, he said.
And while China does offer some undergraduate courses in musical theater, these departments are relatively new and the level of expertise is not deep.
Xu Luyang, a classical music critic, also says that musical productions often ca n't afford the high pay necessary to attract top talent.
 The musical industry is China is still immature, he said.
Rather than continuing to rely on the government's largesse, San Bao says he is looking for investors to fund his next project and hopes that will give him freer creative rein.
 The reason why I produce musicals and will keep doing it is because I like it very much.

"Nelson Mandela, the towering figure of Africa's struggle for freedom and a hero to millions around the world, has died at the age of 95. 
South Africa's first black president died in the company of his family at home in Johannesburg after years of declining health, which had caused him to withdraw from public life. 
The news was announced to the country by the current president, Jacob Zuma, who, in a sombre televised address, said Mandela had ""departed"" around 8.50pm local time and was at peace. 
""This is the moment of our deepest sorrow,"" Zuma said. ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human. We saw in him what we seek in ourselves. 
""Fellow South Africans, Nelson Mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell."" 
Zuma announced that Mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at half-mast. 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a memorial service in Cape Town, where he called for South Africa to become as a nation what Mandela had been as a man. 
Barack Obama led tributes from world leaders, referring to Mandela by his clan name - Madiba. The US president said: ""Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa - and moved all of us. 
""His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings - and countries - can change for the better. His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to, whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives."" 
UK prime minister David Cameron said, ""A great light has gone out in the world,"" and described Mandela as ""a hero of our time"". 
FW de Klerk - the South African president who freed Mandela, shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him in 1993 and paved the way for him to become South Africa's first post-apartheid head of state - said the news was deeply saddening for South Africa and the world. 
""He lived reconciliation. He was a great unifier,"" de Klerk said. 
People gathered in the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandela's life. 
In Soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived. They formed a circle in the middle of Vilakazi Street and sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. Some people were draped in South African flags and the green, yellow and black colours of Mandela's party, the African National Congress (ANC). Mandela's death sends South Africa deep into mourning and self-reflection, nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to inclusive democracy. 
But his passing will also be keenly felt by people around the world, who revered Mandela as one of history's last great statesmen, and a moral paragon comparable with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King. It was his act of forgiveness, after spending 27 years in prison, 18 of them on Robben Island, that will assure his place in history. With South Africa facing possible civil war, Mandela sought reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy. 
He led the ANC to victory in the country's first multiracial election in 1994. He then voluntarily stepped down after one term. 
Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small village in the Eastern Cape on 18 July, 1918, Mandela was given his English name, Nelson, by a teacher at his school. 
He joined the ANC in 1943 and became a co-founder of its youth league. In 1952, he started South Africa's first black law firm with his partner, Oliver Tambo. 
Mandela was a charming, charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. He once said: ""I can't help it if the ladies take note of me. I am not going to protest."" 
When the ANC was banned in 1960, Mandela went underground. After the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle. He was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government. 
Conducting his own defence in the Rivonia trial in 1964, he said: ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. 
""It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" 
He escaped the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison, a huge blow to the ANC, which had to regroup to continue the struggle. But unrest grew in townships and international pressure on the apartheid regime slowly tightened. 
Finally, in 1990, FW de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and Mandela was released from prison amid scenes of jubilation witnessed around the world. 
His presidency rode a wave of tremendous global goodwill but was not without its difficulties. After leaving frontline politics in 1999, he admitted he should have moved sooner against the spread of HIV and Aids in South Africa. 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who headed the truth and reconciliation committee after the fall of apartheid, said: ""He transcended race and class in his personal actions, through his warmth and through his willingness to listen and to empathize with others. And he restored others' faith in Africa and Africans."" 
Mandela continued to make occasional appearances at ANC events and attended the inauguration of the current president, Jacob Zuma. His 91st birthday was marked by the first annual ""Mandela Day"" in his honour. 
Married three times, he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

"1 Flappy Bird 
Be careful what you wish for, especially if you want to invent something new. Recently, Dong Nguyen, the designer of the mobile game Flappy Bird, pulled it from app stores, saying its success - it had been downloaded more than 50 million times, and was making him around GBP30,000 in advertising revenue each day - had ruined his simple life. He took to his Twitter account to say: ""I cannot take this anymore."" 
OK, so regretting making Flappy Bird isn't quite the same as regretting making a rifle, but Nguyen is just the latest in a long line of inventors who wish they hadn't created a monster. 
2 The labradoodle 
The labradoodle isn't a monster - it's adorable, obviously. But what's monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been bred and marketed since the labradoodle's inventor, Wally Conron, first created the breed in the 1980s. ""I've done a lot of damage,"" he told the Associated Press. ""I've created a lot of problems. There are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there."" Conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. What he didn't expect was that the labradoodle - and its other poodle-cross variants, many of which have health problems - would become so popular. 
3 The AK-47 
Six months before his death in December 2013, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifle, wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church: ""My spiritual torment is unbearable. One and the same question: if my ri fl e killed people, does that mean that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a peasant, Christian and Orthodox by faith, am responsible for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?"" 
4 Electronic tagging 
The electronic tag was originally conceived in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners' attendance at schools and workplaces, and rewarding them for good behaviour. Its inventors, Bob Gable and his brother Kirkland, were later horri fi ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. ""It's not pleasant,"" Kirkland Gable told the Guardian in 2010, ""but I'm not in control of the universe. I have to realize there are some things out of my control."" 
5 Pepper spray 
After police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a University of California campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use. ""I have never seen such an inappropriate and improper use of chemical agents,"" Kamran Loghman told The New York Times. 
6 The office cubicle 
In the late 60s, a new form of office was launched, designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. Instead, it became a way for companies to cram employees into tighter spaces, a visual shorthand for uniformity and soulless work. Its inventor, Bob Propst, said in 1997, ""the cubiclizing of people in modern corporations is monolithic insanity.""

"Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa informed Broadwell's attorney Robert Muse of the decision in a brief letter dated December 14.
 As the target of our investigation, we believe that it is appropriate to advise your client that our office has determined that no federal charges will be brought regarding allegations of cyberstalking, Assistant U.S. Attorney W. Stephen Muldrow wrote.
Muse told CNN he was very pleased that the U.S. Attorney's office in Tampa very promptly resolved this matter. 
A source close to Broadwell said the letter had been received Monday.
 She's pleased with the prosecutor's decision and glad it's been resolved, the source told CNN.
Petraeus resigned November 9 after revealing that he 'd been involved in an extramarital affair.
U.S. officials said the FBI discovered Petraeus was involved with Broadwell, a woman who was under investigation for sending allegedly harassing and anonymous e-mails to Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who was friendly with Petraeus and his wife.
Sources close to Kelley said she had not been romantically involved with Petraeus.
During the investigation the FBI obtained Broadwell's computer and discovered she had classified materials. Investigators also searched Broadwell's home in North Carolina. Sources said the materials were technically classified but not highly sensitive. Still the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have not resolved whether Broadwell will face charges for having such materials in her personal possession.
Sources close to Broadwell acknowledged that issue has not been resolved.
Broadwell, 40, wrote a biography of Petraeus, a retired general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later in Afghanistan. A former Army reservist, Broadwell's security clearance was suspended after details surfaced about her possessing classified materials.
During the investigation it also came to light that Kelley and Army Gen. John Allen were exchanging e-mails, some of which might have been considered inappropriate. That matter was turned over to the Pentagon's inspector general for investigation.

"DES MOINES, Iowa -LRB- CNN -RRB- The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce -LRB- or re-introduce -RRB- themselves to a core group of caucus-goers roughly one year before the contest.
Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to test-drive their stump speeches. On style, it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience, though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season.
Marathon time
For the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches, the candidates -- as they were called -- joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines.
Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party.
It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, for example, said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind.
 It was n't just so I can go deer hunting every weekend, I can assure you that, he said.
Others were more blatant.
 I am a potential presidential candidate, yes I am, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN.
Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action, teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he 'll make his decision before June.
 I 'm the one person who can make this country great again, that's all I know, he told reporters Saturday. Nobody else can. 
Palin, in her remarks, was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard-to-follow speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader -- just not Hillary Clinton.
 Hey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary ? she said, prompting the audience to cheer. To borrow a phrase, yes we can ! 
The class of 2016
The speakers, who were typically allotted 20 minutes, used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers.
Other more well-known names in Iowa -- like former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won the state's caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008 -- tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place, dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues.
Given King's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday.
Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, argued there would n't be people coming in here if there was n't a magnet pulling them in, suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers.
The main target in the immigration battle, however, was President Barack Obama's executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or as Palin put it, in her folksy swagger, Obama's decision makes him seem like an overgrown little boy who's just acting kinda spoiled. 
Speakers railed against the President's pledge to use his pen and his phone to work around Congress, with immigration as just one example of what many called the president's overreach. 
That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry's speech, leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstratorschants.
The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country, in particular when it comes to foreign policy, a theme that, along with immigration, also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike in 2012.
Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the isolationism and weakness from the Obama's administration. Cruz, like several speakers, said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words radical Islamic terrorism. 
Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism.
 A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn, Huckabee said.
The issues
There was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage, speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average.
Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King's name -- in all caps -- was plastered across banners on the stage, as well as the podium.
The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat, blasting Obamacare, Common Core, the media, Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110,000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they 'll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else.
Giving a shout out to the state's newly elected U.S. senator, Joni Ernst, was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates. Nearly all of them referred to her as their friend, and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state's other beloved senator, Chuck Grassley.
Walker, who, like Cruz, paced the stage back and forth as he spoke, delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor. He talked about implementing voter ID laws, and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011.
He also did n't forget to mention that he's been elected three times in the past four years.
Shortly after his speech, two men, both from Council Bluffs, talked outside about how they were wowed by Walker's remarks.
 If he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in Wisconsin, this country would be, one man, Michael Patomson, started to say, before his friend, Bill Hartzell, interjected: Transformed. The country would be transformed. 
The reception
Many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit.
 There was just a pantheon of people to listen to, said Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids.
 Rick Perry was better than last time I heard him -- that's good. He needs it, said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County, Iowa.
Christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a Jersey guy reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa.
 That somehow I 'm too loud, I 'm too blunt and I 'm too direct, Christie said, dismissing the criticism as conventional wisdom from Washington pundits. They 're wrong. 
Still, he was noticeably different from his usual style. His demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium, a stark contrast to his preferred off-the-cuff method.
Some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who were n't there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.
Trump put it simply: Mitt had his chance. He should have won and he choked. As for Bush: We 've had enough of the Bushes. 
Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, as well as Gov. Bobby Jindal, also skipped the event, but given that it's year ahead before Iowans start to caucus, it's unlikely that missing one event will hurt them.
Saturday's event was more of a curtain raiser, giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive Republican primary.
Walker, as he closed his speech, offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: I 'm going to come back many more times.

"America is one of the most diversified countries in the world. It is comprised of many different cultures from Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is truly a melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture - an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions, and celebrations of these cultures have been adopted into American culture, including funeral traditions.
 
Traditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some sort of religious ritual, followed by a procession to the burial grounds, and a small ceremony at the grave site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the deceased person's family sends out a death announcement called an obituary. These obits normally serve to pass information to others about the deceased, and the time and day of the funeral event. At the church service, the deceased is usually eulogized by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say a few things about the deceased, and how he or she affected their life. The procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow the hearse, which contains the deceased's coffin, and remains.
At the gravesite, another small ritual takes place where the deceased is given a blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are then allowed to say goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of soil, and tossing it on the coffin as a way of saying farewell to the deceased. The family then gathers at a home, or restaurant with some of the attendees to have a meal, and to exchange stories before going on their way. Most cultures in the U.S. have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that are unique to their individual culture.",C1
"Owing to the great variety of crimes that can be punishable by prison, some people argue that not all criminals are the same and it would therefore be more appropriate to give certain criminals community service instead. I agree that in some cases, prison may not be the best solution and community service would probably have more benefits.
One justification given for prisons is to keep society safe by removing criminals from the outside world. So the first thing to consider is if someone who has broken the law is a danger to other people. In the case of violent crime, there is an argument to keep the perpetrator away from society. However, burglary or possession of drugs, for example, does not involve violence against other people so the criminal does not present a direct danger to anyone in the community. Keeping these types of criminals in prison is expensive for the taxpayer and does not appear to be an effective punishment as they often commit the same crime again when they come out of prison.
Personally, I also believe punishments should reform people so they do not reoffend. A further reason not to put these people in prison is that they may mix with more dangerous and violent criminals, potentially committing a worse crime when they are released. By keeping them in the community, helping others, they not only learn new skills, but they could also develop more empathy and care towards others. If this occurs, society can only benefit.
Critics of this more rehabilitative approach to crime believe that justice should be harsh in order to deter people from committing similar crimes and that community service could be less likely to have that effect. However, there is very little evidence to suggest that long prison sentences deter criminals.
In conclusion, putting criminals who are not a danger to society in prison is expensive and, in my opinion, ineffective, both as a deterrent and as a form of rehabilitation. Community service for non-violent crimes benefits both society and the offender. That said, it would be useful to have more data to work out whether community service or prison is more likely to stop someone reoffending. I strongly believe that decisions on how best to deal with criminals should be based on evidence of what actually works.",C1
"Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police, the largest such purge in the institution's history.
The forced retirements, which were announced in the official gazette over the weekend, are widely seen as an attempt by Humala to combat corruption.
Among those forced out was the head of the national police.
The new head of the police, Raul Salazar, mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony.
 We have to uncover any act of corruption that stains the name of the police. From the most minimal to the most important, it does n't matter, same if one sol or more are stolen, he said, referring to Peru's currency.
In a separate interview on the state broadcaster Tuesday, Salazar said that fighting drug trafficking would remain a priority.
The move means that until new generals are named, many regions in Peru, including many in the interior of the country, will be led by colonels instead of generals, something that opposition politicians have criticized.
Critics also voiced concerns that the move was a ploy by Humala, as a new president, to place commanders loyal to him in the top posts.
His interior minister, Oscar Valdes, said Tuesday that the retirements had to do with a reorganization of a bloated institution, the state-run Andina news agency reported.
 This is a studied measure, it is a re-engineering of the police, he said. It's not possible that the police has so many generals. 
Before the purge, the police had 55 generals, 900 colonels, and more than 2,000 commanders, he said.

"Sweden is the best country for older people, Afghanistan the worst - but general affluence does not necessarily mean better conditions for the over-60s, according to the first global index on ageing. While Sweden's top ranking - followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada - may be predictable, the Global AgeWatch index throws up some surprising results. 
The US, the world's richest country, is down in eighth place, while the UK fails to make the top ten at number 13. Sri Lanka ranks 36, well above Pakistan at 89, despite similar levels of gross domestic product (GDP). Bolivia and Mauritius score higher than the size of their economies may suggest, while the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China are a mixed bag. Brazil and China rank relatively high on the index; India and Russia are much lower. 
""This survey shows that history counts,"" said Mark Gorman, director of the HelpAge International advocacy group. ""The top-ranked countries are what you would expect, but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced universal pensions. The older population in Sri Lanka today is benefiting from good basic education and health care - those countries made certain policy choices. Everybody faces scarce resources, but they should not forget that, when they make investment decisions, they should also address issues of old age."" 
The index, developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development, spans 91 countries and 89% of the world's older people. The survey comes amid a major demographic shift: by 2050, there are expected to be two billion people aged 60 and over, who will comprise more than a fifth of the world's population. 
Population ageing - when older people account for an increasingly large proportion of people - is happening fastest in developing countries. 
More than two-thirds of older people live in poor countries; by 2050, this proportion is expected to be about four-fifths. While it took 115 years for the older population of France to double from 7% to 14% between 1865 and 1980, Brazil is likely to make the same shift between 2011 and 2032 - in just 21 years. 
The index shows that the fastest ageing countries - Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam, where the number of older people is predicted to more than triple by 2050 - fall into the lower half of the ranking, suggesting that policymakers need to tackle ageing head-on if they are to adequately support their populations. 
There are gender differences among ageing populations, with women generally outliving men. In 2012, for every 84 men aged 60 and over, there were 100 women. Lack of paid work (hence savings), less decision-making power in the family and vulnerability to violence contribute towards the disadvantage many women face in old age. 
However, if appropriate measures are implemented, population ageing does not inevitably lead to significantly higher health care spending, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older people. Bolivia, ranked 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced progressive policies for older people, with a national plan on ageing, free health care and a non-contributory universal pension. Nepal, ranked 77, introduced a basic pension in 1995 for people over the age of 70 without other pension income. Though limited in value and eligibility and with uneven coverage, it is an example of how a poor country has chosen to make a start in addressing poverty in old age. 
Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has served the ageing populations of those countries. A good education system - basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions bureaucracy - is of great benefit later in life. In the Philippines, older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946, which made elementary and high school education compulsory. The same is true for Armenia, which, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, benefited from a robust education system. South Korea, a surprisingly low 67 on the ageing index, performed worse than similar countries on a GDP-per-head basis, partly because it introduced a pension only recently. 
The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and an enabling environment. All indicators have equal weight, except for pension income coverage, life expectancy at 60, healthy life expectancy at 60 and psychological well-being. These categories were given increased weighting because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was sufficient data. 
Professor Sir Richard Jolly, creator of the human development index, said: ""This groundbreaking index broadens the way we understand the needs and opportunities of older people through its pioneering application of human development methodology. It challenges countries in every part of the world to raise their sights as to what is possible.""

"The Marlboro Man was a fictional character who appeared in several advertising campaigns for the Philip Morris Corporation. His ads ran on television from 1964 through 1999, effectively entering the collective conscience of the American people for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.
 
The Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse, and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti-smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that ""Tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer."" Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to curb their advertising campaigns.
In 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion. This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the cowboy killer. The Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan, where smoking is still in vogue.",C1
"Standing at the edge of space above the deserts of New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner paused slightly. It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. ""Our guardian angel will take care of you,"" said mission control, and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped. 
Ten heart-stopping minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth, after reaching speeds of up to 725mph, and breaking three world records, including becoming the world's first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.24. ""We love you Felix,"" cheered the control room as his mother, Ava Baumgartner, wept. Baumgartner, who claimed the records for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive, raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team. 
He was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the hugely varying pressures that marked his drop back to Earth. Without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. Baumgartner later told a press conference: ""When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you don't think about breaking records."" He admitted all he could think about was getting back alive, but added: ""Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are."" 
After two aborted attempts the week before, the mission was given the go-ahead on Sunday morning with the cooperation of the weather. Baumgartner was carried up into crystal clear skies by a gigantic balloon, which measured 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, in which Baumgartner sat in his suit. 
As he reached the desired height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 items with his mentor Joe Kittinger, the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight. 
There was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working, causing his visor to fog. ""This is very serious, Joe,"" he told Kitttinger. ""Sometimes it's getting foggy when I exhale. ... I do not feel heat."" But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube. 
The two-and-a-half-hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was matched with a rather more rapid descent. 
Three cameras attached to Baumgartner's suit recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes - which failed to break the existing free-fall record for duration - and then the parachute opening. 
The success of the mission, and of the suit, raises the prospect that astronauts might be able to survive a high altitude disaster of the type that struck the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner's top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts' chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster. 
Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring. The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this attempt - one from 71,000 feet in March and a second from 97,000 feet in July 2012. But no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of Roswell, a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to UFO sightings. 
He was chasing five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free- fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history. The stunt, which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks, beat two of Kittinger's records: the retired US air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960. Suitably, the only voice in Baumgartner's radio earpiece guiding his ascent was that of Kittinger, now 84. 
Asked after the jump what he wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: ""I want to inspire a generation. I'd like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record."" He said the most exciting moment for him had been when he was standing outside the capsule ""on top of the world"". To laughter, he added: ""The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid."" 
Baumgartner said that he had come to feel like Todd's son, adding: ""He was so happy that I was alive."" Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: ""The world needs a hero right now, and they got one in Felix Baumgartner."" To further laughter at the press conference, Kittinger said: ""I would like to give a special one-fingered salute to all the folk who said that he [Baumgartner] was going to come apart when he went supersonic."" 
This will be the last jump, Baumgartner said. He has promised to settle down and enjoy his post-jump years with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria.

"2009 has given employers and employees a run for their money -- literally. Budgets have been cut, layoffs made and furloughs instituted, and benefits and perks have evaporated.
At the beginning of the year, 38 percent of employers said the economy would force them to make administrative cuts sometime during 2009, according to a survey by CareerBuilder.com.
Sixty-five percent of those employers indicated that they would cut back company social events, 61 percent anticipated curtailing business travel, 25 percent expected to scale back on health-care benefits and 11 percent planned to reduce wellness benefits.
Other areas where companies planned to cut spending included special office perks, such as coffee, ice machines or discounted vending -LRB- 34 percent -RRB-, incentive trips -LRB- 28 percent -RRB- and philanthropic activities -LRB- 21 percent -RRB-.
Such perks and benefits being taken away make for a tough situation for employees. Not only are they working harder to keep their jobs, but workers have to do more for less. While some argue that it's hard to keep employees motivated in this situation, others say that they should n't focus on incentives, but rather think about the bigger picture.
 When perks and benefits are taken away, management often does this to allocate resources where they 're needed, elsewhere. The money being saved by not buying bagels every Friday or purchasing Christmas gifts for employees may be going towards your salary, said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staffing and recruiting firm.
 If you had to choose between taking a salary cut and not having free coffee versus being let go, most employees would likely take the former. 
Urmil Tracy Marshall, coordinator for the Office of Diversity and International Affairs at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Georgia., agrees that it's important not to focus on what is being taken away. She said that due to budgetary constraints, furloughs were implemented at the school; but rather than get discouraged, she focused on the positive.
 I reminded myself how blessed I was to even have a job, Marshall said. We need to remind ourselves of our priorities in life, placing a greater emphasis on what we have -- not what we do n't. 
Communication is key
Although it's understandable for employees to be upset, frustrated and discouraged when benefits or perks are taken away, Kevin Sheridan, founder and CEO of HR Solutions, which specializes in helping organizations to keep employees engaged, said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees.
In fact, 82 percent of employees surveyed in HR SolutionsInternational Normative Database say that it's important that their organization allow them to choose from a variety of benefits to meet their individual needs. The survey consisted of more than 3.3 million responses from 2,400 organizations.
 If an organization's leadership team simply decided amongst themselves which benefits would be best to cut, employees will commonly become upset and their engagement will be negatively affected, Sheridan says. Open communication is a key driver of engagement, and employees will immediately recognize the fact that they had no voice in the situation. If leadership had simply asked employees which benefits were important to them, this situation may be avoided. 
Attitude is everything
Despite having to deal temporarily with a few displaced benefits or perks, there are benefits to sticking around with your employer until those things are reinstated.
 It's a good time to remember that the perks were never the reason that you liked the job. No one gets up in the morning saying, I 'm really excited to go to the office because there's free coffee, said Paul Glen, author and management columnist. If people feel that the -LSB- cuts -RSB- are being made in a good-faith effort to save jobs, they will be even more loyal than before, since they believe that the company is working on their behalf -- not just for executives. 
Additionally, according to the HR Solutions survey, 37 percent of employees have thought of resigning in the last six months. Twenty-three percent said they thought about leaving because of pay; 18 percent because of a supervisor or manager; 15 percent because of career advancement; and 5 percent because of benefits. Thirty-nine percent considered it for other reasons.
 This statistic is especially important because many organizations have cut benefits over the last six months, and it illustrates that the majority of employees have not thought of resigning as a result of adjusted benefits, Sheridan said.
 These employees recognize the advantages of sticking around with a company, benefits or not, for advantages such as career development and compensation. Also, as soon as the economy picks up, many benefits programs will be re-evaluated; employees sticking around with these organizations will not remain without benefits forever. 
Workers should also remember that there could be consequences to abandoning a job just because you lost free coffee or a transportation reimbursement. If you 're thinking about leaving your job for such reasons, make sure that your missing perks outweigh any possible career advancement or opportunities you would receive if you stayed.
 In this economy, it may be very hard to find another job, and there's no guarantee that one will have free coffee, either, Glen said. Also, at the new job, even if it is good, the employee will have less tenure and is more likely to be cut in future layoffs. 
If you 've had benefits or perks taken away in recent months and need help staying motivated, remember these five tips from our experts:
1. Get over it
 The longer you talk about it to fellow employees, the longer you will have bad feelings, cause others to have bad feelings and be less productive yourself, which is not what will help the company be able to restore what has been taken away, said Aubrey Daniels, author of Oops ! 13 Management Practices That Waste Time and Money -LRB- and What to Do Instead -RRB-. 
2. Find motivation
Sheridan encourages employees to find motivation through career planning with supervisors, interacting with co-workers or being proud of where they work. For example, an employee could volunteer to act as a sounding board for job candidates considering employment at the organization.
3. Create your own perks
Nancy Irwin, a motivational speaker and author, said employees can take turns bringing in coffee, bagels or potluck lunches to help fill the void of things that have been cut.
4. Understand what's still offered and take advantage
Darcy Eikenberg, president and chief creative officer of Coach Darcy LLC, recalls a client who did n't sign up for a course because she thought training costs had been eliminated. She realized that a co-worker was taking the course and getting it paid for from tuition reimbursement, an area that had n't been cut. Do a deep dive into your company's programs, policies and even discounts because there's probably something you can use now, she said.
5. Focus on the solution, not the problem
Concentrate on actions today that will affect your organization's success and growth tomorrow, said Jonathan Berger, director of human resources at Direct Agents, an interactive advertising company.
 Take this time as an opportunity to offer new ideas to your managers and take an active and entrepreneurial role in helping your company overcome straining times. If you do a good job, you may be rewarded for your efforts when things improve, he said. In addition, by taking on new challenges and opportunities, you can further develop your skills and make yourself a more valuable asset to any organization.

"Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city.
After unsuccessfully demanding a meeting with the Malaysian ambassador at their hotel for more than eight hours, angry relatives pushed past police officers who tried to stop them from making a midnight march across the Chinese capital. Their destination: the Malaysian Embassy.
 The ambassador kept saying he would come but he never showed, an elderly man told CNN as he and scores of others walked quietly through Beijing's streets. As has been the practice of many other Chinese passengersnext of kin, the man asked not to publish his name.
 They 're lying. They 're lying to us, the man repeated. And now we 're going to the embassy. If they wo n't come to us, we 'll go to them. 
The surreal late-night procession was followed closely by police squad cars.
Around midnight, more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit-in outside the embassy gates.
Though vastly out-numbered by Chinese security forces, the family members continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning. They remained camped out by the diplomatic mission more than 15 hours later.
Periodically, they chanted Fulfill your commitments ! No more delays ! No more lies ! Throughout the sit-in, no Malaysian diplomat came out to meet with protesters.
The demonstrators finally dispersed peacefully before sunset on Friday, after camping out by the diplomatic mission for more than 17 hours.
The small gathering departed after delivering a letter of protest to the embassy demanding an explanation for how the prime minister of Malaysia has concluded that the plane ended its flight over the Indian Ocean.
Broken promises
For weeks, distraught next of kin have requested face-to-face meetings with Malaysian officials. They are demanding a briefing on details of the last moments before Flight 370 was believed to have disappeared over the Indian Ocean. In the absence of information from Malaysian authorities, many relatives continue to believe their missing loved ones are still alive.
On several occasions within the last two weeks, Malaysian officials in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur publicly pledged to meet the Chinese families within a matter of 24 hours, but then failed to show up for talks.
 We just want them to stop breaking their promises again and again, said Steven Wang, a spokesman for the families, whose mother went missing when the Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8.
He spoke to CNN in a journalist's area located out of sight of the Malaysian Embassy protest. Even at the early hour of 1 a.m. on Friday, Chinese police had cordoned off an area for media around the corner from the sit-in. During the day, security forces continued to prevent journalists from reaching the families.
Public protests are extremely rare in China. The Malaysia Airlines crisis, which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 Chinese nationals who were on board the plane, has put Chinese authorities in an uncomfortable position.
The Chinese government has tolerated -- but stopped far short of endorsing -- the political mobilization of the flight's next of kin. Families have organized committees, issued press releases, and printed t-shirts and hats with the slogan Pray for MH370. But they have also been largely prevented from organizing public displays outside the windowless hotel conference room that serves as the familiesimprovised headquarters.
On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to express their appeals in a legal and rational way while pledging to give them further assistance. He urged the Malaysian authorities to actively pursue the investigation.

"And now, the rejects.
The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft
Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of Air Force One flying over New York -- a flight that caused panic on the streets below -- the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight.
The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 -- a military version of a 747 -- making three passes by the Statue of Liberty, at one point accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet and at another point making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft. That latter move may have contributed to the chaos below.
The photographs and several lengthy government e-mail chains were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests by CNN and other news organizations.
The e-mail chains show that the flight's government organizers were aware of many New Yorkersfears of low-flying aircraft before the April 27 flight, and show a flurry of second-guessing, finger-pointing, damage control and occasional expressions of regret in the hours immediately after the flight. Watch a compilation of still images of the flyover 
 Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area, an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight. This is an issue that PAG -LSB- the Presidential Airlift Group -RSB- has also been concerned with. As a result, their coordination has been substantial. 
But while the White House, the military and numerous federal and local government agencies coordinated the flight, the federal government demanded secrecy, preparing a news release that was to be distributed only if there were media inquiries.
Those inquiries came during the morning flight, triggering a quick chain of e-mails among government officials.
 We... need to construct some sort of timeline on when folks became aware of it if that is possible, one Air Force official wrote, responding to the public interest.
 I agree we... need to accomplish damage control, but we are n't the POC -LSB- point of contact -RSB-, the response reads. Nor do I want to become a belly button for NORAD to push on this one. 
Wrote one top Pentagon spokeswoman: Nothing like having everyone point the finger at someone else so we ALL look like a big bunch of buffoons... can you say Moe, Larry & Curly !??!?! 
In addition to the informal e-mail banter, the documents show the regimented system the Pentagon uses to monitor and respond to breaking news stories.
A U.S. Northern Command document offers this assessment of the story: Last 4 hours: Story reported quickly. Covered by AP, CNN, FOX major news outlets. Local reporting very critical, highlighting scarefactor. Local populace very critical of event, due to 9-11 sensitivities. 
It continues: Web site blog comments furiousat best. Twitter search reveals tweetsregarding two F-16's chasing commercial airliner. Rate of 1 tweet per minute and growing. 
 No positive spin is possible. Admit mistake, it concludes.
In another e-mail, USAF Col. Scott M. Turner, commander of the Presidential Airlift Group, was doing just that. Again, my apologies sir. Real intent here was to honor NYC, not cause mass chaos, it reads.
The next day, the Northern Command's internal memo included depictions of New York's three major tabloids featuring the headlines, Scare Force One,  Just Plane Stupid ! and How Dumb Was This ! 
The photographs released Friday, meanwhile, show the presidential aircraft making a steep bank, seemingly well beyond the 30-degree maximum for Boeing 747s carrying passengers, according to one airline pilot consulted by CNN. That may have contributed to the anxiety on the ground.
The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $328,835, which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter jets that accompanied it. But, they said, the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission. 
The VC-25 aircraft is designated Air Force One only when the president is aboard. President Obama was not on the plane during the photo op.
After the incident, Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the flyover, resigned.
 I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office, Caldera said in a letter to Obama. Moreover, it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president. After much reflection, I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office.

"Five horror film cliches
Since almost the beginning of cinema, we have had scary films. Of all the genres that exist, horror is perhaps one of the most conventional. Many horror films rely on specific plot devices, also called tropes, to make their audience frightened. When a trope is used too much, it can become a cliche. But when used well, it can really make us jump out of our skin. Here are some of the most used, and perhaps abused, cliches in horror films.
1
No matter what kind of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror films. That's usually where something is hiding or where the evil psychopath has hidden their tools. Basements are always dark and often damp. You can only reach them by a narrow staircase. And basements are always creepy, even when there isn't anything down there.
2
In older horror films, when protagonists were in desperation, it was difficult or impossible for them to call for help or call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a bit less believable now. What's the solution to maintain suspense? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to call for help, you will not have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just as you are making the call. Or both.
3
Horror films love uninhabited places. This could be an abandoned hospital, a scary empty house or a ghost town. There's something about lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too. Of course, abandoned places are also handy for horror film directors in that it's more believable that you will have no phone coverage there either (see above).
4
The hero has been driving for hours. It's night-time and it's beginning to rain. Suddenly he sees a person on the side of the road. Maybe the company will keep him awake? In horror films, giving anybody a ride is asking for trouble. The hero always does it, and it always ends badly.
5
This horror film cliche was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end.",C1
"The bestselling title on Amazon in the US is not Harper Lee's hugely anticipated second novel, Go Set a Watchman, nor George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series, nor even Zoella's much-mocked but much-bought young adult hit, Girl Online . Instead, Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford is topping the charts with her colouring books for adults, taking top spots on Amazon.com's bestseller lists. 
Basford's intricately drawn pictures of flora and fauna in Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide to date, with the newly released follow-up Enchanted Forest selling just under 226,000 copies already. They have drawn fans from Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, to the South Korean pop star Kim Ki-Bum, who posted an image on Instagram for his 1.6 million followers. 
""It's been crazy. The last few weeks since Enchanted Forest came out have been utter madness, but fantastic madness,"" said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books' publisher, small British press Laurence King. ""We knew the books would be beautiful but we didn't realize it would be such a phenomenal success."" 
And it is not just Basford who is reaping the benefits of the hordes of adults who, it turns out, just wanted something to colour in. In the UK, Richard Merritt's Art Therapy Colouring Book sits in fourth spot on Amazon's bestseller lists, Millie Marotta's Animal Kingdom - detailed pictures of animals to colour - sits in seventh and a mindfulness colouring book sits in ninth. Basford's titles are in second and eighth place - that's half of Amazon.co.uk's top ten taken up by colouring books for adults. 
At independent UK publisher Michael O'Mara, which has sold almost 340,000 adult colouring books to date, Head of Publicity, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, attributes the craze to the way the category has been reimagined as a means of relaxation. ""The first one we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown-Ups . It sold strongly and reprinted but it was in 2014 that it all really mushroomed with Art Therapy . It really took off for us - selling the anti-stress angle gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish,"" she said. 
The Mindfulness Colouring Book pushes this perspective particularly strongly, with its publisher telling readers that it is ""filled with templates for exquisite scenes and intricate, sophisticated patterns, prompting you to meditate on your artwork as you mindfully and creatively fill these pages with colour "", and urging potential colourers to ""take a few minutes out of your day, wherever you are, and colour your way to peace and calm "". 
""I think it is really relaxing to do something analogue, to unplug,"" said Basford. ""And it's creative. For many people, a blank sheet is very daunting; with a colouring book, you just need to bring the colour. Also, there's a bit of nostalgia there. So many people have said to me that they used to do secret colouring in when their kids were in bed. Now, it is socially acceptable; it's a category of its own. These are books for adults. The art in my books is super intricate."" 
The illustrator, who lives in Aberdeenshire, has been astonished at the reaction since she released Secret Garden in 2013. ""I had a kids' book commissioned and I told them I would like to do one for grown-ups. It really wasn't a trend then. I drew up the first story and they thought, 'Let's go for it'. I was thinking simply that people like me would like to do it. My intention was just to make a book I would like to have. So it's been a real surprise to see the category bloom."" 
She is currently working on a third book and Michael O'Mara, which already has 17 adult colouring books in circulation, will increase this to 22 by May, with forthcoming titles including The Classic Comic Colouring Book and The Typography Colouring Book. ""It's just an enormous trend and shows no signs of slowing down,"" said McLaughlin, adding that those who buy the titles are keen to display their ability to stay within the lines to the world at large. 
""The pictures are all over Twitter and Instagram. People are really proud of them - they are so intricate,"" she said. ""You don't have to have any artistic talent but what you create is unique. People send us pictures of them, framed and laminated. The appetite is simply enormous. I reckon people are taking their kids' pictures off the fridge and replacing them with their own.""

"Trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the first time in seven months on Thursday after Islamabad agreed to reopen routes, officials said.
The four trucks, under heavy security, crossed the border from Chaman in Pakistan's Balochistan province.
Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants have to be trucked in from Pakistan.
On Tuesday, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial supply routes shut down on November 27, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops.
The incident plunged U.S.-Pakistan relations to an all-time low.
The Pakistani routes offer a shorter and more direct route than the one NATO has been using since November that went through Russia and other nations, avoiding Pakistan altogether.
It has cost the U.S. $100 million more a month to use the alternative northern routes.
Imran Khan, founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf -LRB- Movement for Justice -RRB- party, lambasted the decision to reopen the routes, saying it was done without meeting conditions set forth by Parliament.
He also criticized the incumbent government as being a pawn of the United States.
The talks to reopen routes had been stuck on two key issues -- Pakistan's demand to charge more per container shipped across its border, and Pakistan's demand that the United States apologize for the friendly fire incident in November 2011.
Pakistani Taliban issue threats over reopening of NATO supply routes
On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized.
 We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again, Clinton's statement said.
Until her apology, the U.S. government had only expressed regret over the incident, but had not issued a direct apology.
Under Tuesday's announcements, Pakistan agreed not to impose any transit fee with the reopened routes, Clinton said in a statement.
The Pakistani route costs about $250 per truck. Pakistan had been seeking $5,000 per truck as a condition of reopening the supply lines, which the United States refused to pay.
The U.S. military will now pay Pakistan $1.1 billion it owes as part of the deal struck to reopen the NATO supply lines, according to U.S. officials who had knowledge of the agreement's details but were n't authorized to speak publicly.
The money is part of a U.S. military program called coalition support funds, which reimburses the Pakistani military for counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries.
The Pentagon will consult with Congress about paying the bills prior to paying Pakistan in full, according to one of the U.S. officials.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani Taliban has threatened to attack NATO trucks, saying the supplies are used to target its members fighting against occupation in Afghanistan.
Transporters who resume supplies will be considered a friend of the U.S. and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said Wednesday.
Taliban have attacked NATO supplies in the past, and killed drivers and other crew.

"The tranquil chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to today's generation as people screen out the noises that surround them, a senior US researcher warns. 
Rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, trickling water and trees rustling in the wind, which can often be heard even in urban centres, said Kurt Fristrup, a senior scientist at the US National Park Service. 
The problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traffic, music and other noises, he said. 
""This learned deafness is a real issue,"" Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose. ""We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears."" 
""This gift that we are born with - to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds - is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia,"" he said. 
""There is a real danger, both of loss of auditory acuity, where we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening, but also a loss of listening habits, where we lose the ability to engage with the environment the way we were built to,"" he added. 
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska. Not one was unaffected by some form of noise from human activity, be it over-flying aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats or tour buses. 
Fristrup's team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the US. They predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the US population and more than doubles every 30 years. 
""It's not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment,"" he said. 
""As you raise background sound levels, it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision. Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of only a small area around you,"" he said. ""Even in most of our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to. And that is being lost."" 
People quickly become accustomed to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be. ""If finding peace and quiet becomes difficult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and I think it's a very real problem,"" he said. 
The warning came as other scientists reported beneficial health effects from listening to natural sounds. Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events. 
In one experiment, Taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror. Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traffic, aeroplanes and even normal conversation. 
""We know that natural sounds are very important to people. They are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. They want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,"" Taff said. ""We may be losing this as people are listening to iPods all the time but I do believe that the public is appreciative of these sounds. My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing."" 
Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup speculates that, over millions of years of evolution, we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety. ""I suspect there's something about these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a place that's safe, where there's no sense of a predator nearby, and that these more cluttered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know we've lost that surveillance capability,"" he said.

"One of Barb's favorite activities since moving to the United States was watching television. She especially loved watching the commercials. ""You really can buy anything here in America!"" she told her friends. One afternoon she was watching television and saw a commercial that really grabbed her attention. It showed a cartoon woman tossing and turning. The woman in the commercial was unable to sleep because she was busy thinking about the day that had passed and worrying about the day ahead. Barb wasn't quite sure what the commercial was advertising. Was it a bed? Was it a pillow? Was it just a public service announcement urging people to sleep more? Suddenly a voice on the television began speaking very quickly, listing side effects of the sleeping pill the commercial was advertising. One of the side effects was insomnia. Barb thought that seemed like an odd side effect for a sleeping pill.
 
The next day Barb happened to be in the local neighborhood pharmacy picking up a few things. She remembered the commercial she had seen the night before for the sleeping pills. She walked up and down the aisles looking for them. Since she saw it advertised on television, she thought she might try them. Sometimes she had a hard time sleeping. When she couldn't find the pills on her own, she walked over to the pharmacy counter and asked the pharmacist where she could find the pills.
""Do you have a prescription?"" the pharmacist asked. Barn explained that she didn't, but she saw the pills advertised on television and thought she would try them. ""Those are not available over the counter,"" the pharmacist explained. Barb thought it was dumb for there to be a commercial for something she couldn't just go get at the store. She walked out of the pharmacy without buying anything.",C1
"Some of the most important landmarks in the United States include feats of architecture and modern engineering. San Francisco, California, is a beautiful city on its own, but it is also home to The Golden Gate Bridge, a 1.7 mile suspension bridge connecting the San Francisco Peninsula to the Marin Headlands. The bridge holds the title of one of the Wonders of the Modern World according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.
One of the most popular ways to appreciate the bridge is to take an excursion to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area just outside of San Francisco. The park contains hiking trails, great spots for picnicking, and offers some of the best vantage points for panoramic photographs of the bridge leading into the city.
David recently had some friends visit him in San Francisco, and he made sure to include a visit to the recreation area as part of their tour. They enjoyed walking through the trails, observing some of the native wildlife, and even having a casual picnic in the park. David's friends were thankful that he guided them through this impressive area of California. They made sure to take a group photograph with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. David's friends had the picture framed, and they later presented it to David in order to thank him for his hospitality during their stay.",C1
"Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
The cards only work at four stores for now: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden. So if you 've been wondering how to give your little sister a birthday gift that combines fruit smoothies, lip gloss and unlimited breadsticks, this product is for you.
When you buy a card on the social network for a friend, they get a message informing them of the gift right away -LRB- great for scrambling at the last minute -RRB-. The cash amount is loaded on to a plastic card that is delivered in the mail, likely in some sort of paper envelope.
The recipient can then take that physical card into a physical store and buy physical goods. For an Internet company, it's all delightfully old fashioned.
The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
Facebook is entering a crowded field and offers a couple of features to differentiate itself from other gift cards. The gift giver can choose which of the available stores to give money to -- say $5 to cover a drink at Jamba Juice and $20 for home goods at Target. The recipient can monitor the balances on their card from the Facebook app -LRB- but they ca n't move the money between vendors, no matter how much they would rather have mascara than pasta -RRB-. Any gift amounts they get in the future are automatically added to the same card.
Facebook launched its Gifts feature in September for physical goods like chocolate, shirts, flowers and wine, as well as virtual items like donations to charity, Uber credit and Netflix subscriptions. It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes. This new card is different because it will work at multiple retailers, is refillable and integrates with the Facebook app.
Even though you can see your card's balance on a smartphone, there are n't mobile payment options at the moment. Facebook cards are n't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone. For now the company is sticking with the traditional plastic rectangle and magnetic-strip technology that is most widely accepted across the United States.
The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
It also may create some privacy issues. In order to receive the card, the recipient will have to share their mailing address with Facebook, which might make some people uncomfortable.
Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who do n't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift. Like cash, you know it will be useful and there's no danger of getting people something they will hate. Choosing cards from specific vendors like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be slightly more personal than a Visa card to be used anywhere. With this card you can mix and match stores.
Facebook has been experimenting with all kinds of money-making schemes in the past year, like paying to send messages to strangers. Most of the company's revenue comes from advertising -- 84 %, according to the latest earnings report -- but it also makes some money off games and programs like Facebook Gifts. The social network says it has more than a billion active users, and that's a largely untapped resource.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the Card service. There are no fees for the gift giver or gift receiver, so Facebook is likely earning a percentage from the participating companies.

"A mirror that sends heat into the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth. 
Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres by doing away with power-hungry cooling systems. 
Around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the US goes on air conditioning, but the researchers' calculations suggest that, in some cases, the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling. 
In a rooftop comparison of the device in Stanford, California, scientists found that, while a surface painted black reached 60C more than ambient temperature in sunlight and bare aluminium reached 40C more, the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature. 
""If you cover significant parts of the roof with this mirror, you can see how much power it can save. 
You can significantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning,"" said Shanhui Fan, an expert in photonics at Stanford University, who led the development of the mirror. ""In some situations, the computations say you can completely offset the air conditioning."" 
Buildings warm up in a number of different ways. Hot-water boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings. In hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. Then, there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings. 
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it reflects 97% of the visible light that falls on it. But, more importantly, it works as a thermal radiator. When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a specific wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space. 
To make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to dump unwanted heat. The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. For example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. The Stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink: the universe itself. 
The mirror is built from several layers of wafer-thin materials. The first layer is reflective silver. On top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. These layers improve the reflectivity but, also, turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres. Since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength, the heat passes straight out to space. The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre. 
""The cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day,"" the scientists write in Nature. In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at ambient temperature. 
Writing in the journal, Fan puts the installed cost of mirrors at between $20 and $70 per square metre and calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh on a three-storey building. 
Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings - or other objects - simply by putting it in direct contact with them. Coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior. More likely, the mirror would be used to cool water or some other fluid that would then be pumped around the building. 
He ruled out the idea of using the mirrors to slow down global warming. ""Roof space accounts for only a small portion of the Earth's surface so, at this point, we don't think this would be a geoengineering solution. Rather, our contribution on the greenhouse-gas-emission issue is simply to reduce electricity consumption,"" he said. 
""I'm really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling,"" said Marin Soljacic, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldn't need it at all. You could put it on top of shopping malls. With a large enough surface, you could get substantial cooling.""

"a structured instrument based on one or more underlying assets -- that is sold as a fund but trades like a stock.
The ETF in question was one which tracked the volatile silver futures market and was priced in Swiss francs, they say. Adoboli's job would have been to hedge, or reduce, the bank's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each.
It is thought that he may accidentally have left the Swiss franc vs U.S. dollar side of the equation uncovered and got stung when the Swiss national bank intervened to defend the franc in early September.
Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade.
Its review of UBS will focus on ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement.
Moody's downgraded two French banks earlier this week amid questions over their exposure to debt.
News of the alleged rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield.
Rogue trader's impact on UBS
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is attending a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed.
Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies are also present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month.
On Thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at UBS -- came word that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to Europe's struggling banks.
The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutionsexposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations.

As to the epidosde at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, basic stupidity in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls fat fingers, which means typing the wrong number by accident.
Perhaps the trader put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem, Silva said.
Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job.
 Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam. With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you 're worried about your job and you try to hide -LRB- a mistake or loss -RRB-, you can see how these situations arise. 
A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said.
 He must have done something that he was n't supposed to do, obviously, van Dam said.
UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
But the unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.
Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year.
Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997.
Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie Rogue Trader, lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close.
UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
There is a much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clientsexposure to investment banking losses, he said.
He favors that alternative, he said.
 The banks are too large, van Dam said. The products are so complicated, and the management does n't understand it. 
UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.

"A degree in Spanish got me my first job as a journalist, with an international press agency in Mexico City, but it didn't prevent me blundering badly as a rookie reporter. 
I had just arrived in the Mexican capital after a Greyhound bus journey all the way from New York and the job interview was a test of my language skills. In my new role, day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the office, coordinating the coverage from strife- torn El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the rest of Central America. But, I also had to report on occasional disasters: fires, floods and explosions at fi rework factories. 
It was as a reporter that I soon found out that I was as bad at understanding numbers in Spanish as I was at calculating them in English. Phone calls meant for the police got Mexican grandmothers out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a number and dialled a dodgy digit. Even worse, victims were piled too high in my stories - almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on. Finally, I got a call from the main office in Washington. ""I don't know what training you have had,"" an editor yelled, ""but has no one ever told you a death toll can't go down?!"" 
Why are numbers in another language such a conundrum? It may have to do with different numbering systems. If we consider that, in German, for example, which belongs to the same Indo-European language family as English, 2.30pm becomes halb drei (half of three) and 21 becomes einundzwanzig (one and twenty), clearly different numeral systems can cause confusion and that's without even considering indigenous languages with numeral systems so rare they are in danger of dying out. 
Some experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia - the difficulty in comprehending arithmetic - and problems learning foreign languages, particularly if languages are learnt by rote, since this involves the sequential processes that students with dyscalculia struggle with. But, some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreign-language setting, where learning is more natural and less reliant on sequences of adjectives, prepositions and so on. In my case, I have always found languages easy enough, apart from the numbers. 
But, perhaps it's also because numbers in a non-native language are often heard out of context or in isolation, when the listener might have switched off from the foreign language and be unable to suddenly tune in. A straw poll of multilingual friends found that many can be florid in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu, for example, but freeze if they have to relay numbers, especially over the phone. Numbers seem to be taxing, but no one could really say why. 
In my case, being numerically challenged in a foreign tongue followed me from Mexico to other countries and from Spanish to German and Portuguese. But, in that first journalism job, getting the numbers wrong didn't always add up to failure. 
One night, a Mexican colleague learnt that the American consul in the port city of Veracruz was being held hostage at gunpoint in his office. With no senior English-speaking reporter in the office, it was left to me to try to reach the consulate by phone. Having got the number wrong, I was put through to an extension elsewhere in the building and the identity of the person who took my call was unmistakable: I chatted for 15 minutes to the gunman. I may not have persuaded him to put away his gun - but my reputation as a rookie reporter still rose overnight.

"Peaches Geldof, the daughter of musician Bob Geldof and the late Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose after relapsing into use of the illegal drug following attempts to give it up, an inquest heard Wednesday.
The death of the 25-year-old TV host in April at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London, shocked the entertainment world.
Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent police told the inquest that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for a number of years but had ceased taking the drug more recently.
Geldof, who had two children younger than 2, had been supported by drug treatment workers for 2A 1/2 years, being prescribed methadone, he said. She had said she wanted to come off methadone completely and was following a reduction plan.
A drug test in November indicated that she was not taking any illegal drugs, he said. However, in February, witnesses reported suspicions that she had started using heroin again.
High-grade heroin
Fotheringham's report to the inquest gave new details of Geldof's death.
Police who searched the house where she died found a black cloth bag hidden in a cupboard above the door of a spare bedroom, he said.
Inside was a bag containing what tests proved to be heroin as well as a bag of citric acid, used to make the heroin more soluble in water for injection, according to the report. The bag also held dozens of syringes, some sealed while others contained traces of a brown residue, alcohol wipes, cotton buds and cards advertising a needle exchange in central London.
According to a police drug expert, PC Adrian Parsons, the heroin found was of importation quality -- that is, with a purity of 61 %, compared with the average 26 % purity found at street level.
The 6.91 grams -LRB- about a quarter-ounce -RRB- recovered would have been worth A # 350 to A # 550 -LRB- about $600 to $940 -RRB-, Fotheringham said.
Burnt spoon, knotted tights
Geldof was discovered sitting slumped on a bed in the spare bedroom by her husband, rock musician Tom Cohen, who went to their home after he became concerned when he could n't contact her.
The couple's younger son, Phaedra, was in the house at the time, having been dropped off by Cohen's father the previous afternoon. The musician had taken both children to spend the weekend at his parentshome.
A pair of knotted black tights was found under her body, and a burnt spoon containing a small amount of a brown residue in the bowl was found under the bed, Fotheringham said. The tights could have been used as a tourniquet while she was injecting the drug.
An autopsy also found evidence of recent puncture marks on the inside of both elbows and on her left hand.
The inquest heard that tests by a forensic scientist suggested recent use of the drug, resulting in a high concentration of heroin in Geldof's body, which was at the end of the range of values at which fatalities have occurred. 
She was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of her death, tests revealed. Nor had she taken a significant amount of any other substances in the hours leading up to her death.
Reduced tolerance ?
The scientist's report notes that people using heroin regularly develop a tolerance to the drug, and such individuals can use doses that would be toxic, or fatal, to people with no tolerance. 
But it adds that tolerance appears to be lost fairly rapidly when users cease to use the drug, and deaths commonly occur in people who have previously been tolerant and have returned to using heroin. 
Fotheringham's report concluded, There is no indication that any other third party was present or involved in her death and there is no indication that Peaches intended to take her own life or harm herself in any way as she was reported to be of happy disposition and planning for the future with friends and family. 
Geldof was 11 years old when her mother died of a drug overdose.
Kent police continue to investigate who supplied the heroin to Geldof, but no arrests have been made.

"This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, reaches a notable milestone as the tournament celebrates its 40th year -- the oldest WTA Tour event on the circuit.
The tournament has been hosted in the grounds of Stanford University for the past 14 years, after various different venues in the North California area, and its roll-call of former winners reads like a who's - who of women's tennis.
Martina Navratilova holds the record for most singles titles, with five between 1979 and 1993.
Reigning U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters has four wins, with American legends Chris Evert and Lindsay Davenport and Billie Jean King with three victories each.
And, in recognition of reaching the landmark, tournament organizers have arranged a special presentation before the semifinals on Saturday July 31.
Four former champions, each representing a different decade, will be paraded; inuaugural champion King -LRB- 1970s -RRB-, two-time champion Andrea Jaeger -LRB- 1980s -RRB-, Davenport -LRB- 1990s -RRB- and defending champion Marion Bartoli -LRB- 2000s -RRB-.
It was fitting that King won the initial tournament, as she had fought so hard for the introduction of the WTA Tour.
And, the 1971 tournament at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium, in which King beat Rosie Casals in the final of an event then known as the British Motor Cars Invitational, was to become the first of 24 events that year that formed the first-ever WTA Tour calendar.
The tournament became the Virginia Slims of California in 1974 and its venue moved around the San Francisco area before settling at the Oakland Coliseum between 1979 and 1996.
The tournament has continued to grow and grow since moving to Standford, with Stanford Director of Tennis Dick Gould telling the local Mercury News website: It's been a great marriage and just about every great player from the last 14 years has played here.
 It's been a really great thing for not only Stanford, but for the Northern California community in general. 
Australian Samantha Stosur is the top seed for the 2010 version, although injury means that the Williams sisters -- who both hail from the area -- will not be in action.

"The United States government is composed of three major sections. It is based on the Constitution of the United States of America that was put into effect in May, 1789. The three parts of the U.S. Government are the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Each branch works independently of the other two, and each has its own responsibilities. This system is in place to ensure that no branch can carry more power than the other. This is called the separation of powers, which was written into the Constitution.
 
The executive branch is the branch that most Americans are familiar with. It includes the president of the United States, the vice-president, and the cabinet. The president is the leader of the country and is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. The vice-president is second-in-command, and will act as president if the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The cabinet acts as agents of the U.S. President, and carry out the duties they are entrusted with.
The legislative branch of government consists of the House of Representatives, and the Senate. Together they form the congress, which can levy and collect taxes, mint money, and establish federal courts. It can also declare war, and raise and support the army, navy, and air force to protect the country. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the Senate consists of 100 senators, with two from each of the states. Any legislation, or new law, must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.",C1
"A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday.
A jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife.
The jury of five women and one man deliberated for slightly more than a day before deciding on the amount, attorneys for both sides said. The jurors put the total award at $5.3 million but found that Philip Morris USA was only 36.5 percent responsible for the lung cancer that plaintiffs said killed Leon Barbanell's wife.
Shirley Barbanell herself was deemed 63.5 percent responsible, the attorneys said.
Plaintiff's attorney Jonathan Gdanski said the jury found a design defect and a breach of warranty.
Philip Morris announced that it plans to appeal the case, one of thousands of Engle progeny cases, named after a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that decertified a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry. That case involved Dr. Howard A. Engle, a Miami Beach pediatrician and smoker who served as the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit.
The decertification decision let former class members file lawsuits individually, and thousands did.
The Florida Supreme Court also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease be taken from Engle case and applied to the progeny cases so plaintiff's attorneys do n't have to start from square one in each of these cases, said Ed Sweda, a lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston, Massachusetts.
The industry has balked at that. Today's verdict is the result of a severely prejudicial trial plan, said Murray Garnick, Altria Client Services senior vice president and associate general counsel, speaking on behalf of Philip Morris USA, in a written statement. From beginning to end, this case was marked by legal rulings that should be reversed on appeal, including allowing this jury to rely almost exclusively on findings by a prior jury that have no direct connection with the plaintiff in this case. 
So far, six of the eight Engle cases that have gone to trial have come back with a plaintiff's verdict, said Sweda. Another bunch are in the pipeline ready for trial this year, he said.
About Thursday's verdict, he said, This is certainly a clear indication that tobacco litigation is alive and well. 
Gdanski said his firm has more than 150 Engle cases. We 're more than happy to keep trying them, he said.

"Do you want your child to be good at sport, make the school team and, maybe one day, even compete on the world stage? Well, try to ensure that your would-be Olympian or World Cup winner is born in November or, failing that, in October. A study led by one of the UK's leading experts on children's physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are fitter than everyone else in their class. 
November- and October-born children emerged as fitter, stronger and more powerful than their peers born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays fell in April or June. Dr Gavin Sandercock, from the Centre for Sports and Exercise Science at Essex University, and colleagues found that autumn-born children enjoyed ""a clear physical advantage"" over their classmates. 
The research involved 8,550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex. All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of fitness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. The results revealed that a child's month of birth could make ""significant"" differences to their levels of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport, in which such attributes are vital. Performances at school sports days in the weeks ahead may bear out the findings. 
November-born children were the fittest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. Those born in October were almost as fit, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind. 
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide. ""For example, we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful than a child of the same age born in April. This is, potentially, a huge physical advantage,"" said Sandercock. Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, ""selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individual's physical performance"". 
The study, which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, when scores for the three kinds of fitness were combined, those born in April were the least fit, then those in June. That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers, Sandercock said. 
The findings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double ""autumn advantage"" - they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sport, too. The results show that something other than ""the relative-age effect"" - the greater maturity of those born early in the school year - is at work, especially as the fittest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added. 
The authors believe that autumn-born children's greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D - the ""sunshine vitamin"" linked to a range of health benefits - is the most likely explanation. ""Seasonal differences in intrauterine vitamin D concentrations seem most plausible,"" they say. John Steele, chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, said the quality of a young person's introduction to PE and sport at school can be ""a major factor"" in their sporting development. ""Children that get a high-quality first experience, which develops their physical literacy, are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up"", he said. 
UK Sport could not say if a disproportionately high number of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October. Natalie Dunman, its head of performance pathways, said that, while the differences highlighted in the new findings were borne out by teenagers competing in junior-level competitions, they had disappeared by the time sportspeople were taking part in adult competitions. She said: ""Looking at elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that go into making a champion and our work hasn't uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.""

"Striding on stage, Donald Trump had a surprisingly humble confession to make for someone defying all the laws of political gravity. 
""Unless we win, it doesn't mean a damn thing,"" the would-be Republican presidential nominee warned a campaign rally in South Carolina, despite finishing his fourth month in a row at the top of the opinion polls. ""I want to pick my date for the election. I want it next Tuesday,"" he confided to the 11,000-strong crowd - typical of the grassroots support that needs to flourish into March 2016 for him to win the nomination, let alone November's general election. Such moments of self-doubt are fleeting, quickly replaced by the now-familiar bombast of a billionaire whose status as a ""winner"" has become his defining policy platform. 
Trump is not the only one beginning to wonder whether his improbable campaign can confound the pundits and go the distance, particularly after a burst of recent controversy only seemed to cement his polling lead over bewildered rivals. Conventional wisdom holds that any one of these outbursts would have sunk most politicians by now. 
First, there was the time he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured. Then, there was the first television debate, where he insulted Fox News moderator, Megyn Kelly, because she asked him difficult questions. 
As if PoWs, Fox News and women were not enemies enough, Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently ejected from a rally deserved to be ""roughed up"", appeared to mock a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of cheering on the 9/11 attackers. 
Trump has complained that many of these incidents were exaggerated by the political media, 70% of whom, he says, are ""scum"". But, he has nonetheless refused to retract any of the comments. ""I could have said, 'Oh, I misspoke', but I am not big on that,"" Trump told the crowd in South Carolina. Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trump's supporters will tire of what critics view as his relentless attacks on minorities in particular. One poll shows his support among Republicans down by 12 points - although, at 31%, he still leads the field. 
Other opponents question whether there is much overarching political ideology to Trump. ""He is an egomaniac; he's a narcissist. He's not a conservative, he's not a liberal - he believes in himself,"" former presidential rival, Bobby Jindal, told the Guardian, shortly before dropping out of the race. 
Liz Mair, a Republican strategist organizing an anti- Trump fundraising committee, worries that many of the comments seen as gaffes by the liberal media are, in fact, carefully designed to boost his standing with his core constituency. ""I personally think it's best that people who don't like Trump and his policies do some work to try to actively undercut him,"" she says. ""And not just pray for him to commit real political suicide."" 
Yet, there is more to Trump than attention-grabbing outrage. As he delights in telling supporters, the three issues that he rails against most - immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obama's national security policy - have become perhaps the defining issues of the election. 
His policies for deporting every undocumented immigrant in the US and demanding that Mexico pays for a border wall - ""A real wall. A very tall wall, taller than that ceiling."" - might sound unrealistic but they have arguably destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform. 
So what might it take to stop Trump? One source of optimism among opponents is the strong evidence that polls this far away from election day are an average of eight percentage points out, simply because most people have not made up their minds. Among Americans who identify as Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote. 
In the battle for hearts and minds, converting Trump's passionate supporters will be hard. To blunt his lead, another candidate would need to tap into his support base without jeopardizing their own. Polling experts believe this to be unlikely, as it is hard to imagine anyone doing Trump better than Trump, let alone anyone doing Trump without sacrificing their own support. 
This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: ""Are there any of these candidates you would definitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?"" While 20-30% of voters say they would support Trump, another 20-30% say they definitely would not. 
Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative, said that Trump's antics are ""both a good and a bad thing. On one hand, it produces a loyal following that is attracted to that persona which will not leave you. On the other hand, it limits your ability to grow beyond that."" 
Top Republican pollster, Frank Luntz, believes Trump speaks for voters who, for the first time, feel as if they have a mouthpiece and like the fact that they feel like they are being heard. As the pollster notes: ""Trump says what they're thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him. He's saying what no politician would say and that's another reason they like him."" 
That is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events in recent months. 
""I like the way he speaks,"" says Sandra Murray of Dubuque, Iowa. ""This country is a huge mess and we need to get out of this and, honestly, he could be the man to do it."" 
Other supporters offer a simpler explanation. ""He's not afraid of anybody or anything. That's pretty cool.""

"A nasal spray laced with the 'Love hormone' oxytocin could help children with autism learn to handle social situations better, US researchers claim. Scans of children with autistic spectrum disorder showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions, a shift that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them. 
The scientists behind the research said a course of oxytocin might boost the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. ""Over time, what you would expect to see is more appropriate social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversational ability,"" said Kevin Pelphrey, director of the Child Neuroscience Lab at Yale University. 
Autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in 100 people. The condition affects individuals in different ways, but is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication. So far, there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism. Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a potential treatment for the social impairments caused by autism because it plays a crucial role in bonding and trust. Results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for youths given the chemical over several days. But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to engage more socially, he said. 
""Our study shows that oxytocin affects the brain and opens up the possibility that, when combined with behavioural treatments, it works like a social enhancer,"" he said. The scientists used a technique called functional MRI to scan the brains of 17 youths aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing various emotions. The scans were given 45 minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray. 
The scans showed that reward circuitry in the children's brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin, being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars. The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. ""If this is replicated, it suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don't have a treatment in autism, and that's the core social motivation,"" Pelphrey told the Guardian. 
He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and cautioned against buying oxytocin from suppliers online. ""We don't want them running out on the basis of this study or any other and trying oxytocin at home. There is no telling what they are buying. We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. It needs more follow-up,"" he said. ""This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key regions of the brain involved in social cognition in autism following oxytocin administration,"" said Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University. A surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance on the social cognitive task. Nor is it clear yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects. 
Finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment. 
""From a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. Doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies."" Said Simon Baron-Cohen. 
Uta Frith, who studies autism at University College London, said: ""According to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting as assessed by greater activity in brain structures concerned with reward evaluation. Disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour. Demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.""

"He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on Mars from 2025. But Joseph Roche is different from most critics: he's on the shortlist of astronauts. 
Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the Guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of Mars One. 
The selection process, Roche writes, ""was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes"". He also says the Dutch Mars One team have displayed ""a certain naivety"" in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen. 
He writes: ""More openness and transparency would benefit Mars One greatly but I think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for Mars One to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions."" 
Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. The ranking, he said, didn't mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many ""supporter points"" each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise. 
He writes: ""These points are Mars One's supporter points which 'represent the degree of your support to Mars One's mission'."" These points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One."" 
The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. They would not return to Earth. 
In February, a prominent supporter of the project, Gerard't Hooft, a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. He said: ""It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. When they first asked me to be involved, I told them: 'You have to put a zero after everything'."" 
Roche also spoke to Medium, a US blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about Mars One, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761. 
He told Medium about the selection process in more detail: ""I have not met anyone from Mars One in person. Initially, they'd said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we'd be interviewed, we'd be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process. 
""But then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute Skype call."" 
Roche told the Guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel. 
In his comment piece he writes: ""I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the Mars One plan appealed to me. Although Mars One were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration. 
""Being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with Mars One. If a one-way mission to Mars ever became possible, then I would always volunteer. For an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because I do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.""

"More than a third of all women worldwide - 35.6% - will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner, according to the first comprehensive study of its kind from the World Health Organization (WHO). The report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives, with 30% of women being attacked by partners. It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women - 38% - are carried out by intimate partners. 
""These findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO. ""We also see that the world's health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence."" 
The highest levels of violence against women are in Africa, where nearly half of all women - 45.6% - will suffer physical or sexual violence. In low- and middle-income Europe, the proportion is 27.2%. Yet, wealthier nations are not necessarily always safer for women - a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives. Of the women who suffer violence, 42% sustain injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff. That, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help. Violence has a profound effect on women's health. Some arrive at hospital with broken bones, while others suffer pregnancy-related complications and mental illness. 
The two reports from the WHO - one on the prevalence of violence, the other offering guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women - are the work of Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, lead specialist in gender, reproductive rights, sexual health and adolescence at WHO, and Professor Charlotte Watts, an epidemiologist who specializes in gender, violence and health, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 
""For the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health,"" said Garcia-Moreno. These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, women turning to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies and low-birthweight babies. 
There were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said Garcia-Moreno, ""in whatever region we looked at, it is unacceptably high"". Even in high-income countries, 23.2% of women will suffer physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives, their data from 81 countries shows. The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%. 
More sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in high-income countries than elsewhere - the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives, which is higher than the African rate of 11.9%. But, the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions. 
The authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women are less likely to suffer violence, as are those who have jobs, although not in all regions. There is a need to tackle social norms, said Watts. ""What is society's attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women?"" she asked. ""In some societies, it is not OK - but not all."" 
""I think the numbers are a wake-up call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue,"" said Garcia-Moreno. Over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but ""one has to recognize that it is a complex problem. We don't have a vaccine or a pill "". 
The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend training for healthcare staff in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they rule out general screening - there is not a case for asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence. 
""But, if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries, you should be asking about domestic violence,"" said Garcia-Moreno. ""When I was training in medical school, it wasn't something you learned or knew about. Years later, I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else going on in the woman I was interviewing, but didn't have any sense that domestic violence was the issue. Now, I think I would handle the interview very differently.""  ",C1
"What skills will the workforce of the future need?
As technological innovations continue to change the workplace, we are seeing more industries entrust their operations to new gadgets, software and programs that can transform the workplace. One such technology that has the potential to revolutionise workplaces in the coming years is RPA (Robotic Process Automation). With more industries starting to embrace RPA software, RPA robots would be able to handle mundane, repetitive tasks like some of the clerical work normally dealt with by administrative staff, thereby lowering running costs and increasing productivity.
There is a common concern that companies employing technology like RPA are only interested in increasing their profit margins through cost reduction, and that this trend would eventually leave most of the workforce jobless. However, while it is true that the menial tasks of administrative and clerical jobs are likely to be taken over by automation, the demands on the average office worker will evolve to include more creative work, managerial duties and communication with clients and suppliers.
With this shift in focus, the skills required of future workers are also bound to change. Moving away from basic data entry skills, the worker of the future will be expected to have transferable problem-solving and critical thinking skills that will enable them to tackle any difficult situation and work independently to find solutions.
The ability to adapt and be agile would also be essential in a world that is likely to become increasingly volatile, uncertain and complex. Having such flexibility, coupled with the desire to keep learning and the initiative to step forward, the successful worker of the future is one who will be able to use their skills to seek out opportunities, make improvements and take on new challenges wherever they'll be working.
By equipping our future generation of workers with such business skills, we can ensure that when automation fully takes over, our workers will have the survival skills to become better employees and leaders of the future.",C1
"If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the UN. Each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. Meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition. 
Well-publicized attempts to combat the loss of food - such as recent laws in France that require supermarkets to distribute unsold food to charities - have highlighted the issue of food waste, identified by the UN as one of the great challenges to achieving food security. Estimates suggest that, by 2050, food production will need to have increased by 60% on 2005 levels to feed a growing global population. 
Reducing food wastage would ease the burden on resources as the world attempts to meet future demand. The problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways. In developing countries, there are high levels of what is known as ""food loss"", which is unintentional wastage, often due to poor equipment, transportation and infrastructure. 
In wealthy countries, there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of ""food waste "", which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards. 
In developed countries, consumers and retailers throw away between 30% and 40% of all food purchased, whereas in poorer countries only 5% to 16% of food is thrown away. According to a 2011 report, in Europe and North America, each person wasted 95 to 115kg of otherwise edible food annually, whereas, in sub-Saharan Africa and south and south-east Asia, the equivalent waste was just 6 to 11kg. 
""In the developing world, food waste is virtually non-existent,"" says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Save Food programme. ""Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food. One statistic is that the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries [222m tonnes a year] is almost the same as the total net food production of sub-Saharan Africa [230m tonnes]. But food losses, on the other hand, are really rampant in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have, from management of production to transportation and distribution."" 
The environmental impact of food loss and waste is high. The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2, meaning that, if food waste were a country, it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China. About 1.4bn hectares, or close to 30% of available agricultural land, is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted. And more surface and groundwater, or ""blue water"", is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China. 
""The whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the Earth can provide,"" says van Otterdijk. ""Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is just produced in vain, you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources - on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions."" The worst food waste offenders are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased, followed by Europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away. In the UK, 15m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year. British consumers throw away 4.2m tonnes of edible food each year. This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is avoidably wasted, at an estimated cost to each family of GBP700 a year or almost GBP60 a month. 
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk. According to a nationwide analysis of food waste in UK households, the most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased. By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy. 
The most wasted meat, by both percentage and weight, is poultry, of which 13% of all edible parts (not including bones) is wasted and the most wasted fruit by percentage is melon, with the equivalent of more than a quarter of each melon thrown in the bin. 
The UK has made progress in the past ten years, after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage. It is singled out by van Otterdijk as ""one of the great successes"" in combating food waste. Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of avoidable food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness. Of the food that is not eaten, less is ending up in landfill. In 2000 -01, only 14% of household waste was recycled or composted but, by 2011-12, the amount of composted food had risen to 43%. 
Van Otterdijk says there has been a ""very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest"" in the subject of food waste, enabling grass-roots campaigns around the world to gain momentum. ""We have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors,"" he says. ""But if it continues like this, with the same momentum, maybe, after ten years, we'll have globally significant results.""

"Scientists have created an ""atlas of the brain"" that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ. Like a colourful quilt laid over the cortex, the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter.
""Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one specific aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics or the meanings of words,"" said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.
No single brain region holds one word or concept. A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words. And, each single word lights up many different brain spots. Together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes, clouds, Florida and bra. All light up their own networks.
Described as a ""tour de force"" by one researcher who was not involved in the study, the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks. With further advances, the technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other fields.
""It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,"" said Alexander Huth, the first author on the study. One potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or locked-in syndrome to speak through a computer.
To create the atlas, the scientists recorded people's brain activity while they listened to stories read out on The Moth Radio Hour, a US radio show. They then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.
Huth used stories from The Moth Radio Hour because they are short and compelling. The more enthralling the stories, the more confident the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off. Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words - and more than 3,000different words - as they lay in the scanner. 
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word ""victim"". The same region responds to ""killed"", ""convicted"", ""murdered"" and ""confessed"". On the brain's right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: ""wife"", ""husband"", ""children"", ""parents"".
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings. One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word ""top"", along with other words that describe clothing. But, the word ""top"" activates many other regions. One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.
Strikingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the participants, suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. The scientists only scanned five men and two women, however. All are native English speakers and two are authors of the study published in Nature. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.
Armed with the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. ""The idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain,"" Gallant said. 
Using the same data, the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language, from phonemes to syntax. A brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive, however. ""Every time we come up with a set of narrative features, we get told they aren't the right set of narrative features,"" said Gallant.
Uri Hasson, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, praised the work. Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken, Gallant's team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real- world scenario, he said. The next step, he added, was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas. Ultimately, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. The ethical implications are enormous. One more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public. ""There are so many implications and we are barely touching the surface,"" he said. 
Lorraine Tyler, a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a ""tour de force in its scope and methods"". But, the brain atlas in its current form does not capture fine differences in word meanings. ""While this research is path-breaking in its scope, there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.""

"James Hamblin, senior editor of American magazine The Atlantic, recently joined the unwashed masses. As part of his series, 'If Our Bodies Could Talk', Hamblin, a relatively sane- looking man, took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body. He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did. In doing so, he discovered what thousands of others have: the more we fervently try to clean ourselves with soaps, body washes and those silly little body polishers, the harder our skin works to restore equilibrium, encouraging us to begin the whole bewildering process again. Showering strips the skin of its own oil and bacteria - which, many would argue, is the whole point of showering - but, apparently, this sometimes works a little too well, especially when you add hot water and cleansing products to the mix. 
You know that feeling after a shower when you feel like you're stuck in a skin suit two sizes too small? That's because much of your skin's natural moisture has been washed down the drain. Additionally, our skin, much like our gut, plays host to millions of beneficial bacteria. Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies; they're completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing. And, when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate, they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour - yes, too-frequent showering may actually make you smell more. When you stop showering and using soap, however, your skin goes through an initial (likely gross) adjustment period, after which the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria flourish. 
After everything was said and done, Hamblin realized what other no-soap/no-shower devotees have known for years: that the human body, functioning on its own, is actually quite lovely. It's not just scent or aesthetics, either - although dermatologists suggest that slowing down on soap use can improve acne and eczema. 
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has very real implications for our environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. That's 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we're infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day - sometimes more than once. 
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought. It's becoming clear that clean water is one of the world's most valuable commodities and one that will soon be in short supply. Add in the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you've got yourself a handful of very compelling reasons to let your body go au naturel. 
If this whole thing is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you recall the last time you were cheek by jowl with those who evidently already skimp on the showers - and have clearly not reached the scent-free stage yet - relax. Many cleansing- reduction enthusiasts still use deodorant if they find it necessary (everyone's natural scent varies in intensity and can be affected by a host of factors including diet, hydration and exercise) and hand-washing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. 
You don't need to go cold turkey, as Hamblin did, but in between thrice-daily disinfecting sessions and giving up showers altogether there lies room for our familiar, simple advice. Reduce. Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria flourish a little, would you?

"The Girl Scout cookie ca n't seem to catch a break.
Under fire in years past for including trans fats, high fructose corn syrup and palm oil in its cookies, the Girl Scoutscurrent cookie selling season is under fire because of policies that have nothing to do with the actual composition of the cookies.
A group calling itself HonestGirlScouts.com has posted a YouTube video calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies in response to a Colorado troop's decision to allow a 7-year-old transgender child into its troop. Gay rights and transgender rights groups have reported a grassroots LGBT movement of supporters buying Girl Scout cookies in response to the video.
 I 've decided to purchase as many boxes as my modest budget will allow and donate them to the local LGBTQ community center, says Mara Morken, a lesbian stay-at-home mom in Fargo, North Dakota. I want to show support for GSUSA in their honorable decision to allow all girls to participate in their programs. However I do not want that support to show itself on my thighs, so I will donate the entire cookie order ! 
After an initial burst of publicity around the nearly 8-minute video featuring a teen Girl Scout wearing a Girl Scout sash, the video has been made private on YouTube. However, it's still available for viewing elsewhere on the Internet.
 I ask all fellow Girl Scouts who want a true, all-girl experience not to sell any Girl Scouts cookies until GSUSA -LRB- Girl Scouts of the USA -RRB- addresses our concerns, says the girl, identified as a teen named Taylor, a troop member from California, in some news reports. I ask all parents who want their girls to be in a safe environment to tell their leaders why you will not allow your girls to make any more money for GSUSA. 
The video was prompted by the case of Bobby Montoya, whose mother told a CNN affiliate in October that a troop leader initially told her that Bobby could n't join the troop because Bobby has boy parts, even though her child identifies as a girl.
The Girl Scouts of Colorado blamed the initial decision to exclude the child on ignorance of the scoutspolicy. The state scouts said Bobby was welcome to join Girl Scouts. If a child identifies as a girl and the child's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout, said the Colorado Girl Scouts, in a statement to a CNN affiliate.
The Honest Girl Scouts website says that the Girl Scouts use cookie income to promote abortion and LGBT agendas, introduces Girl Scouts to the concept of sexual rights for children without parent consent and is rewriting badge books to include radical activists and gay role models. 
On its website, HonestGirlScouts.com states that the group is comprised of current and former Girl Scouts, leaders, parents, volunteers and lifetime members. When contacted via its listed Gmail account to comment, someone replied that the group's legal counsel has advised us not to comment or do interviews until further notice. 
Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, dismissed the video as an attempt by conservative activists to raise funds. This issue not withstanding, the Girl Scouts is a really good organization, says Keisling. It's been a really good place for kids to learn things. -LRB- This controversy -RRB- will die down. We as a society are progressing and the outdated reactionary attitude that poor girl was put up to in that video, those attitudes are dying out. 
Other LGBT groups are taking a tongue-in-check approach to the debate, encouraging people to eat more Girl Scout cookies. Girl Scout cookies may not be so great for your waistline but they are great for being inclusive, says Liz Owen, spokeswoman for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays -LRB- P-FLAG -RRB-. Owen reports hearing from people who decided to break their New Year's resolutions to go on a diet with a Girl Scout cookies purchase.

"North Korea is facing possibly its worst drought in 50 years, state media reported this week.
May is on track to be the driest since 1962, with rainfall of less than a quarter of an inch -LRB- 2-5 mm -RRB- recorded in major cities, including the capital, Pyongyang, the Korean Central News Agency said.
The dry conditions are expected to continue into early June, North Korea's Rodong newspaper reported, citing a state weather official.
Rain during the last 30 days has been lower than normal in the North, according to Jang Hyun-sik with the South Korean Meteorological Administration.
 On average, it is supposed to rain in the range of 70-90 mm -LRB- 2.75 to 3.5 inches -RRB- during this period, Jang said, noting that South Korean forecasters do not directly communicate with their counterparts in the North.
Rodong reported that the drought has delayed the planting of corn and has already damaged crops like wheat, barley and potatoes, but said irrigation can fight off the damage. 
North Korea's food shortages are well documented. The World Food Program says more than 6 million people in the reclusive nation do n't have enough to eat.
South Korean Unification Ministry's spokesman Kim Hyung-suk Seoul is open to allowing private organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the North.
No food aid is likely to come from the United States. Washington canceled its plan for food shipments after Pyongyang launched a rocket on April 13.
North Korea said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology.
The move torpedoed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments.

"Tigers are more numerous in Nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south Asia for 100 years, can be saved. 
The number of wild royal bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198 - a 63.6% rise in five years - the government survey showed."" This is very encouraging,"" said Maheshwar Dhakal, an ecologist with Nepal's Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation. 
The census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. More than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about GBP250,000. 
Dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013."" It will take a few more months for India, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,"" he added. 
Nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place. Increasing prosperity in Asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional Chinese medicines. International gangs pay poor local Nepali significant sums to kill the cats. The skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to India, where the major dealers are based. 
One major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. Conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in Nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat. 
As the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. Seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. Villagers are also seeking better protection."" The government is making conservation plans for tigers. But it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,"" Krishna Bhurtel, a local village headman in Chitwan, told Nepali newspaper Nagarik. 
Wildlife authorities captured a tiger in Chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May. Thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. But their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. Chitwan National Park in central Nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by Bardiya National Park (50) and Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (17). 
Diwakar Chapagain, who heads a World Wildlife Fund Nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in Tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes. 
In Nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. Some affluent Nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. Tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicines."" The trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,"" Chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
