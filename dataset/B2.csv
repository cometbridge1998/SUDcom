"Hi!
I've been meaning to write for ages and finally today I'm actually doing something about it. Not that I'm trying to make excuses for myself, it's been really hard to sit down and write, as I've been moving around so much. Since we last saw each other I've unpacked my bags in four different cities. This job has turned out to be more of a whirlwind than I expected, but it's all good! 
I went from London to Prague to set up a new regional office there. You know I'd always wanted to go, but maybe I was imagining Prague in spring when I used to talk about that. Winter was really hard, with minus 15 degrees in the mornings and dark really early in the evening. But at least it was blue skies and white snow and not days on end of grey skies and rain, like at home. It's tough being away from home over Christmas, though, and Skype on Christmas Day wasn't really the same as being with everyone.
From there I was on another three-month mission to oversee the set-up of the office in New York. Loved, loved, loved New York! It's like being in one big TV show, as everywhere looks just a little bit familiar. I did every tourist thing you can think of when I wasn't working, and must have spent most of my salary on eating out. It was really hard to leave for the next job, especially as I kind of met someone (!) More about Michael later ...
So then I was posted to LA, which felt like a whole other country compared with the East Coast. I could definitely get used to that kind of outdoor, beach lifestyle, but I didn't spend as much time getting to know California as I could have because I was flying back to see Michael every other weekend. He came to see me when he could, but his job means he's often working at weekends, so he couldn't make the flight very often. Those three months flew by and then I was off again, to Frankfurt, which is where I am now. And ... so is Michael! He got a month off work and we're trying to work out how we can be in the same place at the same time for a while. We figure the first step in that direction is getting married, which is also why I wanted to write - I can't get married without my oldest friend there! The wedding's going to be at home in London in September and I hope you can come!
Anyway, tell me all your news and I promise not to leave it so long this time!
Lots of love,
Kath",B2
"It was not so much how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it that left researchers gobsmacked. The task? To sit in a chair and do nothing but think. 
So unbearable did some find it that they took up the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium. 
Two-thirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt during a 15-minute spell of solitude. 
Under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button. The difference, scientists suspect, is that men tend to be more sensation-seeking than women. 
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us find it so hard to do nothing. 
In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social media. 
Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the findings were not necessarily a reflection of the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant urge to do something rather than nothing. 
The first run of experiments began with students being ushered - alone, without phones, books or anything to write with - into an unadorned room and told to think. The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. They were informed - specifically or vaguely - that they would have six to 15 minutes alone. 
The students were questioned when the time was up. On average, they did not enjoy the experience. They struggled to concentrate. Their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them. Even giving them time to think about what to think about did not help. 
In case the unfamiliar setting hampered the ability to think, the researchers ran the experiment again with people at home. 
They got much the same results, only people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones. 
To see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists recruited more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers' market. They, too, disliked being left to their thoughts. 
But, the most staggering result was yet to come. To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of administering a mild electric shock. 
They had been asked earlier to rate how unpleasant the shocks were, alongside other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle. 
All the students picked for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks after receiving a demonstration. 
To the researchers' surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks, as did six of 24 women. 
""What is striking is that simply being alone with their thoughts was apparently so aversive that it drove many participants to self-administer an electric shock that they had earlier said they would pay to avoid,"" the scientists write in Science  
Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably zap themselves to cheer up a tedious lecture. But, she says more needs to be known about the motivation of the shockers in Wilson's study. 
""Imagine the setup - a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts,"" she said. 
""As they sit there, strapped to this machine, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock - was it really that bad? 
""What are the experimenters really interested in? Perhaps this is a case where curiosity killed the cat.""",B2
"Keith recently came back from a trip to Chicago, Illinois. This midwestern metropolis is found along the shore of Lake Michigan. During his visit, Keith spent a lot of time exploring the city to visit important landmarks and monuments.
Keith loves baseball, and he made sure to take a visit to Wrigley Field. Not only did he take a tour of this spectacular stadium, but he also got to watch a Chicago Cubs game. In the stadium, Keith and the other fans cheered for the Cubs. Keith was happy that the Cubs won with a score of 5-4.
Chicago has many historic places to visit. Keith found the Chicago Water Tower impressive as it is one of the few remaining landmarks to have survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Keith also took a walk through Jackson Park, a great outdoor space that hosted the World's Fair of 1892. The park is great for a leisurely stroll, and it still features some of the original architecture and replicas of monuments that were featured in the World's Fair.
During the last part of his visit, Keith managed to climb the stairs inside of the Willis Tower, a 110-story skyscraper. Despite the challenge of climbing the many flights of stairs, Keith felt that reaching the top was worth the effort. From the rooftop, Keith received a gorgeous view of the city's skyline with Lake Michigan in the background.",B2
"The Griffith Observatory is a planetarium, and an exhibit hall located in Los Angeles's Griffith Park. It features several astronomical displays and telescopes in the Hollywood Hills in the Los Feliz district of the city. The Observatory was built on land donated by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and mining tycoon, who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art observatory, so it was free of charge to visitors. He felt common people should be able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not be solely for the scientific community.
Griffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that opened on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the opening, the planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the major attractions was the Foucault Pendulum that is designed to show the earth's rotation and the Zeiss reflecting telescope. The observatory has a striking view of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.
In 2002 the planetarium was subjected to a $93 million renovation and expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After it reopened in 2006, the facility expanded underground with new exhibits, a cafe, a gift shop, and a theater. The Wilder Hall of the Eye section concentrates on the astronomical aspect of the observatory. It is where people can view the stars through the observatory's telescope, and features an interactive exhibit that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky is another popular attraction for viewing images in the night sky that are visible to the naked eye. The observatory frequently stages viewing nights when the public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open daily, and remains free of charge.",B2
"-LRB- The Hollywood Reporter -RRB- It's official: AMC's The Walking Dead companion series has a title.
Executive producer Robert Kirkman announced Friday that the companion series, which starts as a prequel to the original, will be titled Fear The Walking Dead. 
The news comes as the companion went through development season -- and was picked up to series and preemptively renewed for a second season -- under code names including Cobalt and Fear The Walking Dead. 
On March 9, AMC announced the series pickup and renewal for the then-untitled series.
Kirkman, who created The Walking Dead comic series, co-wrote the pilot with Dave Erickson of Sons of Anarchy. Kirkman and Erickson will executive produce alongside Walking Dead's Gale Anne Hurd and Dave Alpert. Erickson will serve as showrunner, and Adam Davidson will direct the pilot. Walking Dead visual effects guru Greg Nicotero will also executive produce the series.
While AMC has been tight-lipped on the seriespremise, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the drama is a prequel that takes place in Los Angeles at the onset of the zombie outbreak. AMC confirmed that the companion series is set in Los Angeles but revealed nothing more beyond that it will focus on new characters and storylines.
Cliff Curtis -LRB- Gang Related -RRB- stars as Sean Cabrera, a teacher who shares a son with his ex-wife. Sons of Anarchy's Kim Dickens is set to co-star as Nancy, a guidance counselor who works at the school with Sean and is seeing him romantically. Frank Dillane -LRB- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -RRB- co-stars as Nancy's son Nick, who has battled a drug problem. And Alycia Debnam Carey -LRB- Into the Woods -RRB- is will play Nancy's ambitious daughter, Ashley, who is the polar opposite of Nick and dreams of leaving Los Angeles for Berkeley when the apocalypse strikes.
 Fear The Walking Dead will premiere in the late summer with season two set for 2016. An official premiere date has not yet been announced. The season five finale of the flagship series airs Sunday at 9 p.m.

"There can be different kinds of entertainment at a wedding reception. Usually there will be a Master of Ceremonies, or MC, who helps move the reception along by making announcements of what will happen next. For example, the MC will announce when the newly married couple enters the reception hall, and all the guests will stand up and applaud. A wedding reception usually has music and guests are expected to dance. The music can be provided by a DJ or by a live band. Sometimes the DJ or live band will accept requests from guests to play a certain song. When the newly married couple enters the reception, they will share a dance by themselves to a song they picked beforehand. Usually the song is something romantic and represents the couple's love for one another. Sometimes the bride will share a dance with her father and the groom will share a dance with his mother. After these special dances, the guests are invited to the dance floor.
 
Food at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself or herself, or it can be a sit-down meal served by waiters. Guests get to choose among a meat, chicken or fish deal. Guests generally make their choices when they respond to the initial wedding invitations.
During a wedding, guests shouldn't expect to spend too much time with the bride and groom. The new couple is usually very busy greeting all of their guests. Sometimes the couple doesn't even get a chance to eat. What almost every newly married couple does get to eat at their wedding reception is the wedding cake. The bride and groom traditionally cut through the wedding cake together, and then feed the other person a bite.",B2
"Facebook has lost millions of users per month in its biggest markets, independent data suggests, as alternative social networks attract the attention of those looking for fresh online playgrounds. 
As Facebook prepares to update investors on its performance in the first three months of the year, with analysts forecasting revenues up 36% on last year, studies suggest that its expansion in the US, UK and other major European countries has peaked. In the last month, the world's largest social network has lost 6m US visitors, a 4% fall, according to analysis firm Socialbakers. In the UK, 1.4m fewer users checked in in March, a fall of 4.5%. The declines are sustained. In the last six months, Facebook has lost nearly 9m monthly visitors in the US and 2m in the UK. 
Users are also switching off in Canada, Spain, France, Germany and Japan, where Facebook has some of its biggest followings. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment. 
""The problem is that, in the US and UK, most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done it,"" said new media specialist Ian Maude at Enders Analysis. ""There is a boredom factor where people like to try something new. Is Facebook going to go the way of MySpace? The risk is relatively small, but that is not to say it isn't there."" Alternative social networks such as Instagram, the photo-sharing site that won 30m users in 18 months before Facebook acquired the business, have seen surges in popularity with younger age groups. 
Path, the mobile phone-based social network founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin, which restricts its users to 150 friends, is gaining 1m users a week. It has recently topped 9m users, with 500,000 Venezuelans downloading the app in a single weekend. 
Facebook is still growing fast in South America. Monthly visitors in Brazil were up 6% in the last month to 70m, according to Socialbakers, whose information is used by Facebook advertisers. India has seen a 4% rise to 64m - still a fraction of the country's population, leaving room for further growth. 
But in developed markets, other Facebook trackers are reporting declines. Analysts at Jefferies bank have developed an algorithm that interfaces directly with Facebook software and it ""suggests user levels in [the first quarter] may have declined from peak"". 
Jefferies saw global numbers peak at 1.05bn a month in January, before falling by 20m in February. Numbers rose again in April. The network has now lost nearly 2m visitors in the UK since December, according to research firm Nielsen, with its 27m total flat on a year before. 
The number of minutes Americans spend on Facebook appears to be falling, too. The total was 121 billion minutes in December 2012, but that fell to 115 billion minutes in February, according to comScore. 
As Facebook itself has warned, the time spent on its pages from those sitting in front of personal computers is declining rapidly because we are switching our screen time to smartphones and tablets. 
While smartphone minutes have doubled in a year, to 69 a month, that growth is not guaranteed to compensate for dwindling desktop usage. 
Facebook is the most authoritative source on its own user numbers, and the firm will update investors on its performance for the quarter. Wall Street expects revenues of about $1.44bn, up from $1.06bn in 2012. 
Shareholders will be particularly keen to learn how fast Facebook's mobile user base is growing, and whether advertising revenues are increasing at the same rate. 
Mobile usage represented nearly a quarter of Facebook's advertising income at the end of 2012, and the network had 680m mobile users a month in December. 
The company warned in recent stockmarket filings that it might be losing ""younger users"" to ""other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, Facebook"". 
Wary of competition from services that were invented for the mobile phone rather than the PC, founder Mark Zuckerberg has recently driven through a series of new initiatives designed to appeal to smartphone users. The most significant is Facebook Home, software that can be downloaded onto certain Android phones to feed news and photos from friends - and advertising - directly to the owner's locked home screen.

"Passover is a Jewish holiday that remembers and celebrates their liberation from ancient Egyptian slavery as described in the Old Testament of the Bible. It is traditionally celebrated in the spring and lasts about a week.
 
According to the story in the Bible, God punished ancient Egypt with 10 plagues. The last plague killed Egyptian first-born males. Jewish people were told to mark their doors with lamb's blood so that God would know to pass over these houses and not kill any first-born males inside. This is where the name of the holiday, Passover, comes from. After this last plague the Egyptian king, known as the Pharaoh, agreed to release the ancient Jews from bondage. The Bible story also says that the Jewish people left their homes in such a rush after they were freed that they didn't have time to wait for the bread to rise. This is why at the commemorative Passover meal, Jewish people eat matzo, bread without yeast, also known as unleavened bread. The matzo and other foods are eaten at a special meal called a seder.
There are very specific rituals that happen at the Seder meal. These rituals are all in a book called the Haggadah. Inside the Haggadah is also the story of the Jewish exodus from Egypt. During the seder meal parts of the Haggadah are read aloud. The first part of the meal is a blessing over wine. The second part of the meal is the washing of hands. The third part of the meal is when someone dips some sort of vegetable in salt water and then eats the vegetable. The vegetable symbolizes the humble origins of the Jewish people. The water symbolizes their tears. The fourth part of the meal is when three pieces of matzo are broken.",B2
"Stephanie recently took a weekend trip to Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is a coastal city situated along the Pacific Ocean. Many celebrities earned their claim to fame here. Although the town offers many attractions centered around Hollywood culture, there is a lot to see and visit in Los Angeles.
Of course, all things related to Hollywood are popular tourist attractions. The Hollywood Sign, located the Hollywood Hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, is a famous landmark for this star-studded town. Once in downtown Hollywood, it's possible to take a stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This landmark contains more than 2500 brass stars dedicated to celebrities who have made a significant impact on the entertainment industry. In Hollywood, visitors can even take tours of popular movie studios. Stephanie had a chance to visit Universal Studios, which produces her favorite films.
Los Angeles is also a popular beach town, offering plenty of opportunities for sunbathing and surfing. A common beach destination is the Santa Monica Pier, which offers rides and attractions to its visitors. Here, Stephanie rode the iconic Ferris wheel, which offered her a spectacular view of the city and coast.
These are just some of the things Stephanie experienced during her visit to Los Angeles. She loved her trip, and she hopes to return someday soon.",B2
"-LSB- Breaking news alert, 6:23 a.m. GMT -LRB- 01:23 a.m. ET -RRB- -RSB-
Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- along with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- following a historic referendum vote. A majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking away and becoming an independent nation.
With 31 of 32 councils declared, the No campaign has won the referendum on Scottish independence.
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond admitted defeat in Scotland's independence referendum Friday -- and urged the rest of Scotland to do the same.
In a televised statement, he thanked Scotland for 1.6 million votes for Scottish independence. A turnout of 86 % is one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote, he said.
-LSB- Original story published at 12.37 p.m. ET -RSB-
Voters in Scotland made their choice Thursday -- remain part of the United Kingdom, or form their own independent nation. They chose to remain.
With 31 of 32 of councils reporting, the No campaign had garnered enough votes to secure their victory, and with it Scotland's continued place within the union.
The first councils to declare all went to the No campaign, as did the capital, Edinburgh, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the union with 123,927 for Yes and 194,628 No votes. Argyll and Bute and Aberdeenshire also voted No. 
Glasgow delivered a solid win for the independence camp with 194,779 votes for Yes, and 169,347 for No, but lead was not big enough to overturn the No camp's overall majority so far, which maintains a 8 % -LRB- 54 % to 46 % -RRB- lead over pro-independence camp.
The majority of the early results have been going the anti-independence camp's way. The No campaign extended lead with Angus and East Dunbartonshire council results, alongside a landslide in Dumfries and Galloway. The oil-rich city of Aberdeen also strongly voted for the unionist camp.
The city of Dundee was the first big gain for the independence campaign, voting Yes with 53,620 votes for, 39,880 against.
The individual counts by local authorities are ultimately immaterial as it is the total number of votes countrywide that will determine the outcome.
Polls at more than 5,500 stations across all districts, from the remote highlands and islands to the big cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, closed at 10 p.m. local time -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB-. People still in line to vote at that time were allowed to cast ballots.
High turnout
The first districts to report turnout reported high participation -- well over 80 % in most cases -- Mary Pitcaithly, chief counting officer, announced in Edinburgh.
Turnout in Glasgow, one of the Yes campaign's heartlands, was a relatively disappointing 75 %.
More than 4.2 million people registered to vote on the question: Should Scotland be an independent country ? 
A vote for independence would mean Scotland, with its population of about 5.3 million, splits from the rest of the United Kingdom, made up of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in addition to Scotland.
 The people of Scotland have engaged in this conversation, Phil MacHugh, a spokesman for the Yes camp, told CNN on Thursday night. They have really gone out there, found out the information that they wanted to know, and made that choice today. 
Prime minister's address
British Prime Minister David Cameron will make an address Friday morning. The content will depend on the outcome of the vote, but in the event that Scottish voters decide to stay in the union, Downing Street says he will refer to plans for further redistribution of powers from the central government to the Scottish Parliament, signed by Westminster leaders earlier this week.
The counting officer for Edinburgh, Sue Bruce, explained just after 10 p.m. that each ballot will be double-checked, to verify each voter's decision.
Addressing dozens of election workers, Bruce added, I look forward to working with you during the course of the evening to deliver an accurate and transparent Edinburgh count in which you and the voters of Edinburgh can have full confidence. 
Voting was brisk at one polling station in Glasgow as the polls opened Thursday, with many people voting on the way to work or before taking their children to school.
Bad weather or the sheer volume of votes cast could slow down the counting process. However, the weather forecast appears good so far -- important when some ballot boxes must be collected by helicopter, plane or boat from polling stations on distant islands.
Allegations of voting fraud were reported by Glasgow City Council, with several instances of people turning up at voting booths in Scotland's largest city to vote, only to be told that they had already voted.
The Council stressed that there was never actually a situation of double voting and the affected ballots are now being searched for and taken away.
Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who has led the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, cast his ballot Thursday morning in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire.
Labour lawmaker Alistair Darling, who has headed the pro-union Better Together campaign -- backed by the main parties in Westminster -- voted in Edinburgh, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, another pro-union campaigner, voted in the town of Kirkcaldy.
For the first time, the vote was extended to 16 - and 17-year olds living in Scotland. Nearly 110,000 people younger than 18 have registered to vote.
Voters in the referendum did not have to be British citizens; Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens who live in Scotland and are registered to vote there can cast a ballot. However, Scots living outside Scotland do not have a say.
Nearly 790,000 people applied for a postal vote -- the largest volume of registration for postal votes ever in Scotland.
After the polls closed, Salmond tweeted, This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands. 
CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Glasgow, Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London and Euan McKirdy wrote and reported in Hong Kong. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Lindsay Isaac and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

"Countries rarely default, at least not under the basic understanding of the term.
If you or I ca n't pay our bills and creditors come calling, eventually we can declare bankruptcy and painfully move on. Most of our creditors get little or nothing back. And companies to do it all the time -- indeed, it seems a matter of course for U.S. airlines.
But countries do n't really go bankrupt. They choose to stop paying, one way or another.
The difference ? Countries get new tax payers every day. They are born or they migrate. Countries can not become insolvent. They stop paying to save money.
READ MORE: Nine things we missed during the shutdown
How do they choose to default ? Politicians can flirt with financial suicide, as some members of the U.S. Congress are fond of doing. But let's be clear, the U.S. was not going to default. The showdown was just politics.
 The United States has enormous credibility and is at no risk of default, Anne Pettifor, of Prime Economics, told me. In my view there is no possibility whatsoever of the USA defaulting on its debt. 
So, the USA can not really default, thanks in part to a strong Federal Reserve and international creditors still wanting to buy its bonds, no matter how low the interest rate falls.
But other countries have chosen to default, at least in theory. From Argentina to Russia to North Korea, countries have stopped paying the interest or principle on domestic or international obligations.
In Russia's case, it was able to pay back creditors within a few years, thanks to the rise of energy prices. Russia did not walk away from its creditors.
READ MORE: Five most surprising things in debt deal
Argentina was a much tougher case. When it stopped paying creditors in late 2001, it caused a great deal of pain for its citizens in 2002-2003. Its efforts to settle with creditors still bubble up in New York courts. No one can say Argentina has fully recovered its reputation in the international markets. Some bondholders simply refuse to take a portion of what they are owed and move on. They want their money back.
Still its economy grew quickly within a few years of default. Does that mean that defaulting is not a terrible step ? After all, it means a country can get a handle on its obligations.
 The debts become more manageable and therefore the country becomes more creditworthy, Pettifor said. Then, however, the creditors pile in. 
READ MORE: Conservatives defiant in face of GOP troubles
Nazi Germany defaulted in 1933. The new government was not going to honor the obligations of the previous leaders. We all know how that went. It was decades before some of the German debt was paid back in a token way.
No eurozone country has unilaterally refused to pay its bills. The market made it impossible for the like of Ireland and Greece to issue new bonds at a sustainable interest rate. New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away. We know them as the troika -- made up of the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund.
Greece's meltdown led to bondholders taking the haircut, yet the country is set to take another package of aid. But it ca n't inflate its currency -LRB- it lost that option when it joined the euro -RRB- and ca n't default -LRB- for the same reason -RRB-.
READ MORE: U.S. must shake this addiction to debt -- or kill the recovery
The latest plan is not the bailout, but the bail-in. Look at Cyprus. Bond holders hold off, the depositors pay up -LRB- those forced to bail-in -RRB- and everyone holds their breath hoping the country can rebuild its economy and banking sector and eventually pay back something.
After all, the troika expects to be paid back. If not, that would be a default. All this makes you wonder why the USA would even want to be mentioned in the same breath or paragraph with these countries.

In 2010, the planetary defence team at NASA had identified and logged 90 per cent of the asteroids near Earth measuring 1km wide. These 'near-Earth objects', or NEOs, are the size of mountains and include anything within 50 million kilometres of Earth's orbit. With an estimated 50 left to log, NASA says none of the 887 it knows about are a significant danger to the planet.
B
Now NASA is working towards logging some of the smaller asteroids, those measuring 140 metres wide or more. Of the 25,000 estimated asteroids of this size, so far about 8,000 have been logged, leaving 17,000 unaccounted for. Considering that a 19-metre asteroid that exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.
C
Whether NASA can find the remaining middle-sized NEOs depends on getting the money to build NEOCam, a 0.5-metre space telescope which would use infrared light to locate asteroids. If it did get the money, it could probably achieve its goal in ten years. Once logged, the planetary defence team would still need to work out how to defend the planet against being hit by the truly worrying asteroids - the PHAs.
D
'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' are rocks close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit. NASA has created a map of 1,400 PHAs, none of which are expected to be a threat in the next one hundred years. With technology already available, NASA can track these objects and make predictions about possible impact, at which point two defence solutions could be launched.
E
The first is DART - the Double Asteroid Redirection Test. Plans are scheduled to test DART on the moon of an asteroid called Didymos. 'Didymoon' is 150 metres wide, orbiting its 800-metre mother, and hopefully the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up.
F
Another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth is to blow it up using a nuclear weapon. It may sound like a plot from a film, and it was the subject of the 1998 film Armageddon, but the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER) is a genuine NASA proposal. The eight-ton rockets would be fired at an approaching asteroid with the hope of bumping it off course. If the asteroid was too close to Earth for this plan to work, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to blow it up instead.",B2
"At least eight people are dead after a bizarre mix of weather across the country spawned tornadoes, ice storms and record-setting warmth this weekend.
Four of the deaths involved two vehicle accidents in Kentucky. Three people drowned in the Rolling Fork River near New Hope when a car drove into the water. Two people escaped but were hospitalized with hypothermia.
 Water was out of the banks, considerably up onto the roadway area. They ran their vehicle into the water. Two of the folks were exiting the vehicle as the swift water started pushing the vehicle downstream. The other three occupants of the vehicle were unable to exit, said Joe Prewitt, with Nelson County Emergency Management.
In the other crash, a rider on an ATV overturned into a creek near Carrollton and was trapped underneath.
The Kentucky Emergency Management reported a fifth death because of flood waters, in Ballard County, but did not provide specifics.
Authorities did not release the identities of the victims.
Several flood warnings remained in effect Sunday along some Kentucky rivers and streams.
Two deaths occurred in the Mississippi counties of Coahoma and Jasper, where severe weather damaged homes and knocked down trees, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.
The eighth fatality came from a traffic accident near Kansas City, said Chris Redline of the Missouri Department of Transportation.
 We also had to close a lot of roads in southeast Missouri because of flooding, Redline said.
Flooding, extreme cold and unseasonable warmth covered other parts of the country. To make sense of it all, let us take you on a North American tour.
Southeast: Thunderstorms, tornadoes and torrential downpours
Heavy rain, damaging winds and lightning continued. These storms were forecast to spread, bringing downpours to Georgia, South Carolina and up the East Coast into Monday.
While cooler, the weather is expected to be much quieter and drier Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
On Saturday night, the National Weather Service said a tornado was likely to blame for damage in central Mississippi, including four semi-trucks overturned and five houses heavily damaged.
The main trigger for the severe weather is the above-average temperatures farther north.
Midwest: Lake-effect snow
Sara Hadley sent CNN iReport photographs Sunday of the aftermath of a storm in Lansing, Michigan.
 It did n't start off too bad until we lost power last night. At that point we knew it was getting bad. Last time we had ice like this was 1998, she wrote.
Her images showed branches and pine cones covered by thin layers of ice.
Moderate to heavy lake-enhanced snow was expected for far western and north central upper Michigan into Monday night.
Central Plains: Slammed with ice and snow
Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees colder than normal Monday with a gradual moderation into Christmas Day.
In Kansas and southeast Nebraska, snowfalls will total 3 to 6 inches. And those cold temps will keep folks shivering.
Whitney Eichinger of Southwest Airlines said the company is trying to offer customers options.
 We are allowing customers to rebook their trip with no penalty through -LRB- Sunday -RRB-, she said. That has more to do with traveling to the airport, not flight cancellations. 
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast: Weirdly warm
If there is one present being handed out on as winter begins, it is the well above-average temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic.
New York City broke a record high Sunday, according to Ashley Sears, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
 -LRB- The record -RRB- was previously 63 degrees in 1998. And we are currently sitting at 70 degrees, which we 've been at for the past couple of hours, she said.
Farther north, however, the situation has been less cozy. In Maine and across New Hampshire, Vermont and into northern New York, winter warnings -- including ice storm warnings and freezing rain -- were in effect.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a winter ice emergency and activated the state's emergency operations center.
The National Weather Service in Buffalo said up to an inch of ice accumulation is expected, and areas near the St. Lawrence and Black Rivers could see even more.
Canada: Unusually cold
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford described the winter weather Sunday as one of the worst storms in the city's history.
He said he hopes that power will be restored to the more than 250,000 customers currently without it by Christmas Day.
Toronto Police Sgt. Jeff Zammit said it has been colder than normal during December, and that freezing rain and fallen trees have brought down many power lines.
 It truly is a catastrophic ice storm that we 've had here, probably one of the worst we 've ever had, Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines told CTV Network.
For customers with service, the company asked that they share the power and consider asking neighbors inside.
The city has also opened warming stations.

"Valentine's Day, February 14, is a holiday that celebrates love and friendship in the United States. Most people think of it as a romantic day to show the one you love how much you care by purchasing cards and gifts. Valentine's Day is also an extremely commercial holiday. People spend money on flowers, balloons, chocolate, stuffed animals, and jewelry. People also go out for expensive dinners. Valentine's Day is even celebrated by school children, who give thank-you cards to their teachers. Some high schools have Valentine's Day dances. Classmates give each other little cards. These cards can be purchased at any store with famous cartoon characters. It is considered much more thoughtful to have kids make handmade cards to give to friends and teachers.
 
Valentine's Day is also a great day to announce your love to someone like a secret crush. Some people even get married on Valentine's Day. However, you don't have to be in love to share in the festivities. You can say ""Happy Valentine's Day"" to friends and coworkers.
Valentine's Day is not an official holiday though in the U.S., meaning government offices and schools are open as usual. The date used to be the celebration of a Saint named Valentine who allegedly saved a young girl's life. It wasn't until the Middle Ages that romance somehow got mixed in with the date and lovers would send each other handwritten love notes. Back then you couldn't just go to the store and buy a card the way you can now.
You know Valentine's Day is around the corner when stores begin to decorate with red and pink hearts and the symbol of Cupid, a winged ancient Roman god said to strike the hearts of people Now it seems Cupid goes straight after your wallet because you will also see many more jewelry ads as Valentine's Day approaches.",B2
"Six Uyghurs who were imprisoned in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were transferred Saturday to the South Pacific island nation of Palau, the Justice Department said.
Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori were resettled in Palau, the Justice Department said in a statement Saturday.
Seven Uyghurs are still at Guantanamo Bay, where 215 prisoners remain. Uyghur is an ethnic group from western China.
Since January, 25 detainees have been transferred to other countries.
The United States has coordinated with Palau to ensure that the transfers take place under appropriate security measures and will continue to consult with the Republic of Palau regarding the individuals, the Justice Department said.
The 13 Uyghurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan. Some of them have been cleared for release since 2003, and other Uyghurs have been released to other countries. The United States said it would not send them back to their homeland because of concern they would be tortured by Chinese authorities.
The Chinese government has said no returned Uyghurs would be mistreated and has repeatedly warned other countries against taking the men. Beijing officials this summer again urged the United States to hand over all remaining Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere.
China alleges the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization, that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang.
On October 20, the Supreme Court tentatively agreed to accept an appeal from the 13 Uyghurs to be released into the United States from American military custody.

"Most artistic directorsfirst day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers. But for Nacho Duato it's a challenge just to find the rehearsal room.
The mazelike corridors of the magnificent Mikhailovsky Theatre in St Petersburg prove confusing and inspire a few unchoregraphed twists and turns from Duato before he finally identifies the right room and his new company -- the 140 dancers of the Mikhailovsky Ballet.
It's unlikely the theater's floor plan will be the last challenge for the Spanish choreographer who, this month, took over leadership of the company.
He's the first foreigner to lead a Russian ballet company in over a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to the Mikhailovsky's classical repertoire.
 Having a look at the past but always stepping forward and stepping into the future... this is what I think they want and that is why I think they called me, said Duato. I think they have it pretty clear that they want to change; that they want something new. 
A modern ballet dancer and choreographer with an international pedigree, it is hoped he can revitalize the ballet for Russian audiences. While performances at the Mikhailovsky are well attended, there's a growing concern that Russians may become tired of seeing the standard repertoire of classical ballets.
 Russians love ballet. That goes without saying, but the attitude that exists towards Russian ballet in the West is more passionate, said Vladimir Kekhman, billionaire fruit importer and General Director of the Mikhailovsky Theatre.
 I would like that within Russia we would have the same attitude because as we say We do n't treat what we have until it's gone.I consider ballet to be a national treasure, he added.
Kekhman is a relatively recent convert to ballet but he has become something of a cultural entrepreneur, investing $45 million of his own money to restore the Mikhailovsky's buildings and, hopefully, its reputation.
Kekhman required fresh talent to oversee his vision and for that, he says, he had to look beyond Russia.
 I looked within our industry to see who were considered living legends of choreography, and when I looked within Russia, I realized that we did n't have choreographers who had the ability to not just choreograph, but also head the company, he said.
He approached Duato, a non-Russian speaker, who has spent the last 20 years choreographing new works as Artistic Director of the Spanish National Dance Company.
At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet. But then Mikhailovsky offered him the chance to bring modern choreography to a classical ballet company and it proved an offer too enticing to pass up.
 I know many people who think he's -LRB- Kekhman -RRB- crazy, that I 'm crazy and that this is never going to work, said Duato. That this mixture is just like a bomb, an atomic bomb. But he made me feel that Let's try, let's do it. Why not ? Maybe we can do it.
Bringing a modern approach to ballet in Russia, where it's ingrained in the culture might daunt some, but it's a task Duato is relishing.
 It's not a pressure. It's a pleasure. It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet -LRB- has been -RRB- part of the cultural tradition for -LRB- such a -RRB- long time, and at the same time they want to break through and do new things, Duato said.
Duato has set himself a challenging schedule, hand-picking three dancers to create a ballet so new it does n't even have a name yet. They have just weeks before the world premiere.
Principal dancer Ekaterina Borchenko is the jewel in the Mikhailovsky's Imperial crown. The company's star ballerina has danced the principal roles in productions of classical ballets including Swan Lake,  Giselle and La Sylphide. 
Now, she's relishing the chance to stretch her skills. In this repertoire, I can show a different side of myself, express myself differently and find something new in me, she said.
Opening night will be a litmus test of just how receptive Russians are to this new direction.
Duato believes ballet is a living organism, which needs to evolve constantly in order to keep the audience interested. It's a philosophy he shares with Kekhman.
 Together we are going to work into something, said Duato. We do n't know how it's going to be but I think it's going to be beautiful. If we put all our hearts and soul into it, it's going to be something fantastic.

"One of the most historic, and significant landmarks in the United States is the San Francisco cable car system. It is the world's only, manually operated cable car system. It is run by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The system dates back to 1878, when the California Street line first opened. In all, there are three lines currently operating in the city, and boasts a fleet of 12 cable cars. There used to be 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the diverse communities that make up San Francisco. The open-air cars are a major tourist attraction, and are still used by San Francisco commuters on a daily basis.
 
The simple reason cable cars were first used in the city was because of its landscape. San Francisco is very hilly, which makes it impossible for municipal buses to scale. The solution for this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally pulled by cable, up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to get from one end of the city to the other.
There are two types of cars in use today. Single-ended cars and double-ended cars. The single-ended cars have open-sided sections with seats that face outward to the street. The rear section of these cars is enclosed with seats facing the interior of the car. These cars seat 29 passengers. They travel in both directions by using a swivel-based turntable that turns the car at the end of the line. The double-ended cars are a bit larger, and can hold up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats, and grips for an additional 34 standing passengers. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun they are to ride. People who ride the San Francisco cable cars are stepping into part of California's history.",B2
"Pulling into the parking lot of the largest supermarket in town, Joe could already see it was going to be a challenge to find parking on this Saturday morning. He decides to first drop off his wife Melissa, so she could get a head start on the shopping they need to do. Meanwhile, he battles to find a free spot amongst the crowd of other waiting cars.
 
Inside, Joe finally finds Melissa, whose cart already loaded with packages of organic snacks and drinks. He knows Melissa is easily tempted by fancy words that promise health benefits. It makes her feel good to know that she is making healthy decisions. In the past, Joe would try to reason with her, explaining that health is not about consuming specific items, and more about general lifestyle. Today, he decides to simply move on. As the chef in the family, Joe looks forward every week to the process of selecting meats and vegetables, imagining all the ways he can flavor and cook them. Free samples are being offered at the familiar locations - Melissa makes sure to hit up every station. They agree the chicken sausage is their favorite and buy two packs. The buy-one-get-one-free fresh pasta attracts Joe, while the sale on cheesecake draws Melissa.
As they wait in line to check out, Melissa examines their overflowing shopping cart and realizes that they are over budget. She puts back the snacks and drinks that were clearly impulse buys, and happily claims she is learning to be a great shopper! Joe can only smile at the expression on her face. Five months ago when they first got married, he never imagined he would enjoy these Saturday morning grocery trips. Now, he finds in them a peaceful satisfaction, a welcome change from his work all week.",B2
"The longest truck in the world
In the outback of Australia, Jeremy Hart hitched a ride on the Centipede.
'If I take my foot off the accelerator, it'll take us
about four kilometres to stop,' says Matt
Langley, the Australian captain of the
Centipede, which, at approximately 54.5 metres,
and consisting of a driver's cab and six trailers,
is claimed to be the world's longest truck. Matt
has a delicate touch. His hands, on the 60 cm
steering wheel, control a million dollars' worth of
trailers carrying zinc ore.
 One false move on the narrow 128-km road
from McArthur River Mine, the world's largest
zinc mine, to the port at Bing Bong and the
Centipede, with its 110 wheels, would crash.
However, in two years of delivering valuable
loads of powdered zinc ore from mine to coast,
the truck has had only one accident. x1xx7xx
 I asked him about the job. 'The hardest thing
is the concentration. The road is really boring
and in places it is a bit rough. One problem is
the fact that you are pulling six huge trailers
behind you. x2xx xx I'd hate that to happen to
me.'
 Almost 60 metres ahead of the last trailer,
high above the road in the air-conditioned
comfort of Matt's cab, you can lose almost all
sense of pulling 130 tonnes of raw material.
x3xx xx This movement is repeated down the
length of the Centipede. Matt is in control but
you can see it takes a real effort.
 In this most remote northern corner of
Australia, traffic is not a problem for Matt and
his co-driver, Mick Webster. 'Some days we
don't see another vehicle on the run to Bing
Bong, but when we do, we try to be as
courteous as possible,' says Matt. ' x4xx xx
In any case, some are too scared to try.
Others think this is just a normal-sized
vehicle with two or three trailers attached.
When they see it's six, they either back off or
go by us with their mouths wide open.'
 The truck is breaking new ground in
technology. The Northern Territory
government had to change the regulations to
legalise the Centipede for road use. ' x5xx x
They're sealed with covers to prevent ore
dust from polluting the environment, and they
have a special loading and off-loading
device.'
 It took just under two hours, in a
temperature of 40 degrees, to crawl at no
more than 64 kph from McArthur Mine to Bing
Bong. x6xx xx
 On arrival at his destination Matt punched
a button to unload the zinc onto the floor of
the huge cyclone-proof warehouse where it is
kept before being shipped to Europe and
Asia. It didn't look like much. 'When you see
how small a full load looks when it's unloaded
onto the floor of the warehouse, it's very
frustrating,' he says. ' x7xxx x ' I asked him
how he enjoyed the job. 'I wouldn't do
anything else, mate,' was his reply.",B2
"In a daring operation worthy of a movie, three men escaped from a Canadian jail by helicopter, prompting a massive manhunt, authorities said.
The men escaped from a detention center Saturday night in Quebec City.
 A helicopter touched down briefly in the courtyard before taking off with the three prisoners, said Ann Mathieu, a spokeswoman for Quebec Provincial Police.
 We are talking closely with the detention center to figure out exactly how the escape transpired, Mathieu told CNN partner CBC. The priority... is to find the helicopter. 
A manhunt is under way for Yves Denis Yvon Lamontagne, 35, Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49.
The first two men were arrested in a drug bust in 2010 and were awaiting trial. Police found weapons, dozens of cars and a plane during the bust, it said. There was no information provided on the third suspect.
It marks the second brazen jail escape in Canada in a little more than a year.
In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away.
It was a real James Bond moment, witness Francis Emond said about last year's escape from the facility in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal.
While spectacular, airborne escapes are not unprecedented.
Albanian inmate Alket Rizaj broke out of a maximum security prison in Greece twice -- in 2006 and 2009.
On both occasions, accomplices swooped in to the prison's courtyard on helicopters. Inmates then climbed aboard using rope ladders.
Both times, Rizaj was recaptured.
Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic.
But the plot was foiled when the prisoner was shot and the chopper was forced to land on the prison parking lot.
In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter. The New Yorker's flight inspired the book The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan and the 1975 movie Breakout. 
And in France, Pascal Payet escaped not once, not twice, but three times from French prisons.
Each time, he was recaptured.

"Who says adult parties have to be boring. More and more adults are reliving their childhoods or creating memories they didn't have as children by having theme parties for their birthday or other occasions.
Theme parties are based on an idea, a television show, a fictional character, or really anything. Sometimes guests are expected to dress according to the theme as well. For example, the Toga party is a type of theme party where guests are expected to dress in togas, really just white sheets. Toga parties used to be especially popular among college students. In a masquerade party, everyone wears a mask and has to guess who is behind it. The mystery is part of the fun. Speaking of mystery, there are murder mystery parties, where the guests have to solve a fake murder. Some adults throw parties based on seasons. A summer beach party, for example, might feature guests wearing their swimsuits. Another popular type of theme party is the game night party. In this type of party, people get together to play various board games. A variation of the game night party is the casino party, where adults play games typically found in a casino-like blackjack or poker.
Another theme party could focus on a specific region or country. For example, a Mexican theme party might feature tacos, the colors of the Mexican flag and Mexican music. Guests should be careful when dressing up for these types of theme parties though. Dressing up like a certain ethnic or racial group is usually considered offensive. It's better to just enjoy the food, and not portray a stereotype.",B2
"The religious or civil ceremony that makes people legally a married couple is just one part of the actual wedding. After the wedding comes the reception. A wedding reception is a party held immediately after the marriage ceremony. Usually there is a little bit of time, about an hour, between the ceremony and the reception to give people enough time to travel from the ceremony location to the reception location. Most wedding receptions are held at a catering hall, which is a place that specializes in hosting big parties. However, wedding receptions can be held in restaurants, parks, and even in museums or zoos. A wedding reception is usually not held at the same place as the ceremony, but sometimes they do.
 
When guests arrive at the reception, the bride and groom are usually not there to meet them. Right after the ceremony the newly married couple, the bridesmaids, and the groomsmen will go somewhere to have photographs taken. While this is happening, guests are usually treated to a cocktail hour at the reception site. During this time appetizers and drinks are served. This also gives guests a chance to socialize. After the cocktail hour, the main dining hall is opened. At a wedding reception the seating is usually prearranged. Each guest will receive a card telling him or her where they are expected to sit. Tables are arranged by numbers. In front of the reception hall, there is a special table for the bride and groom.
Once everyone is seated, waiters begin to serve salad or bread and drinks. Some receptions have an open bar, meaning the alcohol is free. Other receptions have a case bar, meaning non-alcoholic beverages are free; guests are expected to pay for their own alcoholic drinks.",B2
"There may be no greater American than George Washington. Washington became the first United States President in 1789 with his unanimous victory in the first American election. He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the only president ever to garner 100 percent of the electoral votes. Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when the country was not yet established.
 
His epic ""Crossing of the Delaware"" river to recover New York City is still considered one of the greatest military moves in the history of warfare. At the time of the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was on the run and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a move that many military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.
Another landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the nickname, ""The Father of His Country,"" because of his military intelligence, and his concern for the people of the United States.",B2

Hi Meena,
Thank you so much for offering to house sit for us next week. I'm only sorry we won't get to catch up properly until we get back from our trip. Anyway, here's everything I won't have time to tell you on Saturday morning.
The alarm code is 7957. Don't forget to set it when you go out and remember to turn it off when you get back home as it is LOUD!
The rabbits need feeding once a day and under no circumstances should they be allowed out of their cage in the garden as the neighbour's cats have attacked them in the past.
Please can you use the washing machine in the daytime only as it's old and noisy and the neighbours complain otherwise?
Would you mind opening all the upstairs windows for an hour in the morning as the house gets damp at this time of year?
That's about it! You'll find everything you need in the house, and help yourself to anything in the fridge or cupboards. Feel free to call or text if you have any problems/questions.
See you briefly to hand over keys on Saturday morning and looking forward to a proper chat when we get back!
Thanks again!

"Serial dater Emmanuel Limal was tired of meeting women who weren't ready to start a family, or at least wouldn't admit that they were. The 43-year-old actor, originally from France, had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children. He recently took his quest online but was dismayed by the results. 
""I got frustrated with everyone trying to sell themselves as really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children,"" Limal said. ""On some sites, there was an option to click, saying: 'I'd like kids someday,' but you would read the person's profile and think: 'You will never have time!' If someone's going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first."" 
Limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family - his father is one of 11 - he has always wanted more children. ""I couldn't seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family and struggled with when to mention wanting kids any time I met someone new. It's the ultimate dating taboo,"" he said. ""Then one day I read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was 'really bad to admit' but she wanted children. And I just thought: 'You shouldn't be ashamed of this.'"" 
Limal remortgaged his apartment to fund the setting up of Babyklar.nu - or 'baby-ready now' in English. It functions like a normal dating site but every potential dater is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. ""We ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children as well as wanting another baby,"" Limal said. ""But we don't make them specify how many children they'd like. That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online."" 
The response to the site has been overwhelming, he said. ""We had 50 sign-ups an hour when we launched in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together. I'm fully expecting the first Babyklar.nu baby by next summer."" More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with testimonials such as ""It's so lovely to be able to say this out loud"" and ""I finally dare to be honest about what I want."" 
The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people. Danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmark's population. The usual suspects are being blamed for the new low - women leaving it ""too late"" and couples cohabiting and waiting to start families. 
""Now, I hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven't met the right person yet will have another option,"" says Limal. He's keen to point out that this isn't just about baby farming: ""I want this to be about children and love. My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner - and who'll stay together. I'm a romantic at heart."" 
There are plans to roll out the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits. ""Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country's so small, a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel,"" Limal said. What's more, Limal has finally found love. ""I've met a nice woman and she wants a baby too - so we shall see.""

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- As one of the world's leading financial capitals, Hong Kong is a dream destination for business travelers.
With more skyscrapers than any other city in the world and some of the finest dining on the planet, the city might well leave you begging for a flight cancellation so you can squeeze in an extra day.
To help you enjoy a few of the city's highlights, here's a guide to getting into town, eating/sleeping well, buying the best souvenirs and leaving with an expense account you 'll be proud of.
Easiest, most comfortable airport transfer
Forget everything you know about subways -- Hong Kong's Airport Express train service blows away even the most jaded commuter.
Trains are clean, comfortable, spacious, always on time and get you to the city in 24 minutes flat, faster than any car service can ever aspire to.
Better still, the trains are easy to walk to and the procedure simple to figure out upon arrival -- there's virtually no stress about how to get tickets or where to get the trains as you exit the arrival terminal.
At HK$100 per ride, trains depart at 10-minute intervals from 5:54 a.m. to 11:28 p.m. and 12-minute intervals from 11:28 p.m. to 12:48 a.m. daily.
Memorable meals
There's no shortage of Michelin-starred restaurants in Hong Kong.
But finding a memorable local meal you 'll be thinking about for months is far more challenging.
Luk Yu Teahouse has it all: a historic art deco-inspired feel, waiters that have stuck by the place through decades, killer Cantonese food not found anywhere else, a glamorous clientele and a storied past that includes a mob hit in the dining room.
You 'll have to get here early for a breakfast of old fashioned dim sum, such as duck and chestnut pastry.
Luk Yu Teahouse, Luk Yu Building, 24-26 Stanley St. Central; +852 2523 1970
Centrally located room with a view
For a true home-away-from-home feel, the penthouse suites at The Upper House are a good call.
With more than 180 square meters of understated elegance, wraparound views of Hong Kong and a spa-inspired bathroom, this is the ultimate city stay.
Bonus feature: the chance of bumping into a celebrity in the elevators.
The Upper House, Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Admiralty; +852 2918 1838
Where to get a unique addition to your wardrobe
Hong Kong's fashion design scene is young, eclectic and fun.
A place to get a taste of it is K11 Mall, dubbed an Art Mall for its support of Chinese contemporary art and reputable gallery in the basement.
The mall houses local designer brands, and offers its own curated selection of designer products at the K11 Design Store.
K11, 18 Hanoi Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon; +852 3118 8070
Where to take a killer photo
Sure, you could ride the historic Peak Tram with the tourists and snap a great photo of Hong Kong at the top of Victoria Peak -- it's foolproof.
But you could also join local hikers -LRB- of which there are many -RRB- to walk up Lion Rock Peak for the most incredible sweeping panorama of Kowloon, all surrounded by pristine nature.
Experience the heart of the city
To see Hong Kong, past and present, in a walkable nutshell, head to the Central and Sheung Wan Districts.
Some of the oldest parts of the city, with crumbling colonial-era tenement buildings and decades-old shops, can be found in these areas.
Gentrifying comfortably, Soho and Poho -LRB- the neighborhood between Po Hing Fong and Hollywood Road -RRB- areas offer thoughtful eateries and unpretentious boutiques.
General directions: Keep walking west on Queen's Road Central, or the parallel Hollywood Road.

Some of the best memories visitors take away from Hong Kong are centered on food.
To take a little bit of local flavor home, you can pick up a couple jars of XO sauce.
Every restaurant worth its reputation will have its own secret recipe for the mildly spicy local condiment made from dried and often precious seafood, as well as Chinese ham.
We love the one at the Mandarin Oriental Cake Shop -LRB- $35/small, $45/large jar -RRB-.

"An ultra-marathoner trying to run from Florida to Bermuda in a human-powered inflatable bubble was rescued Saturday morning after he signaled for help, the Coast Guard said.
Reza Baluchi, according to his website, has set a goal of running across more than 190 recognized nations to encourage world peace. CNN ran a story about him in 2012.
The Coast Guard first encountered Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the coast of Miami, disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda, a Coast Guard press release said. It was not clear when he started his quest.
A Coast Guard cutter found Baluchi. Officials described the craft as a hydro pod bubble and a man in a 2013 YouTube video called a Baluchi bubble a big hamster wheel. It moved along the ground as Baluchi ran inside.
In the press release, the Coast Guard said Baluchi had protein bars, bottled water, a GPS and a satellite phone. The Coast Guard conveyed the voyage's dangers and asked Baluchi to quit his journey because he did n't have enough supplies. But he would n't leave his vessel, officials said.
The Coast Guard monitored his progress and on Saturday morning an exhausted Baluchi activated his personal locating beacon, the Coast Guard said.
A Coast Guard HC-130 airplane and MH-60 helicopter, along with the vessel Maersk Montana, were sent to rescue Baluchi 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine, the Coast Guard said.
He was exhausted and taken to the Coast Guard air station in Clearwater, where his medical condition was evaluated. There were no reported injuries, the Coast Guard said.
 Part of his effort was to make world peace but he got caught up in the Gulf Stream, said Coast Guard public affairs specialist Mark Barney. The chances of muscling out of the Gulf Stream were pretty low. 
Baluchi could not be reached for comment, but a video posted on Baluchi's Facebook page described his plans to travel in the bubble across the Caribbean, as well as his other athletic exploits.
The CNN.com story quoted Baluchi saying he 'd run across the United States twice and around its perimeter once. He fled Iran to escape persecution, he said. Now he is an American citizen.
 Reza does n't listen to anyone, Davis Hyslop, a businessman and one of Baluchi's supporters, said in the 2012 story. He has these outsized ambitions that he sets his mind to. He's a success above and beyond anyone's expectations. It's almost biblical. But you got ta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor, right ?

"Baseball is the oldest major league sport in the United States today. With the growing popularity of American football and basketball, baseball now must share the limelight with these sports. During the late 1990s, baseball was in trouble. Attendance was down. High profile sports that featured fast-paced action such as football and basketball were stealing baseball's thunder. That was all before Barry Bonds and a couple of other sluggers brought the game back to center stage.
 
Bonds played the first part of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he enjoyed moderate success. After being traded to the San Francisco Giants in 1992, Bonds began a second career that put him into the spotlight for both the right and wrong reasons. At an age when most players begin to decline in performance because of their advancing age, Bonds went on a home run tear that was unprecedented in the history of the game.
Bonds never hit more than 34 home runs in one year for the Pirates, but, playing for the Giants, he hit an astounding 73 home runs in 2001. This shattered a record that had stood for 40 years. Bonds was 38 years old by the end of the 2001 season, and many questioned how he could put up numbers like that. The answer to that question came out years later when Bonds was accused of taking illegal, performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds eventually broke Henry Aaron's record for most home runs in a career, but many baseball purists feel that the record is tainted because of the illegal drug use.
Bonds' post baseball career has been damaged because of the drug use, and Major League Baseball has implemented a drug use policy since his retirement. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of perjury for lying about his drug use, but was able to strike a deal to stay out of jail. In any event, his legacy is forever soiled.",B2
"Fires are destructive. They also create changes. In 1871 a fire burned most of Chicago to the ground. Many people think the fire was started when a cow knocked over a gas lamp. Most of the city at the time was built of wood. This, combined with the famous Chicago winds and a drought, made the city burn down quickly. The fire lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming the third most populous city in the United States.
 
The Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million, more than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died, and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two years. It began enforcing building regulations because of the fire.
The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City caused the fourth highest loss of life from an industrial accident in the U.S. history. 123 women and 23 men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Child labor was not uncommon. The youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked in the factory. So many people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions. The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions. Women workers also formed a union to fight for better working conditions.",B2
"Each New Year's Day, the city of Pasadena in California hosts a celebration to welcome the year with a series of events that includes the Rose Parade. The parade takes place in the center of the city on Colorado Blvd, and features numerous floats, marching bands, equestrian teams, celebrities, and honorees. It is the most popular parade in the country. It has spawned several other New Year's Day parades throughout the country. In Miami, it's the Orange Bowl Parade; in New Orleans, it is the Sugar Bowl Parade; in Arizona, it's called the Fiesta Bowl Parade. However, the Rose Parade is the oldest and best parade. Many people like to camp out in tents or in sleeping bags the night before to get the best locations to view the Rose Parade.
 
To brave the cold weather, some people bring portable heaters to keep them warm. It can get into the low 40s at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many people dress warm for the occasion. Food is another big feature at the pre-parade celebration on New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of the grilling food fills the night air, and most people are willing to share their food with other overnight campers. It is fun to sample different dishes from other grillers.
As night turns into morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited about the start of the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully decorated in flowers, while the dancers and other performers dress in colorful costumes, some of which are made just for the parade. The marching bands come from nearby cities, high schools, and colleges. It is considered a great honor to participate in the Rose Parade.",B2
"Bob knew that the house he just purchased was in a historically rough neighborhood. There was a history of gang violence, including shootings, in the neighborhood. That is probably why the house was so inexpensive. The previous owners of the house had it foreclosed. Then some house flippers bought the property for a very cheap price, renovated it, raised the sales price, and sold it. Bob thought the house was still a good bargain though.
 
After he moved in, Bob began to see that many of the renovations to the home were merely cosmetic. While the house flippers put in new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, they hadn't upgraded the electrical work. This meant that every time Bob ran the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the power in the house went out. Bob spent over $1,000 dollars to have the house rewired. The new carpets that the house flippers installed was put over the original hardwood floors. Bob decided to rip out the ugly oatmeal colored carpets and refinish the old floors. That was another $3,000.
The house was an old stucco house that got very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The house flippers installed some cheap windows. Bob hired a contractor to put in new double pane storm windows and install ceiling fans. That was another few thousand dollars. Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he leased solar panels that were installed on the roof. This not only lowered his monthly electric bill, but added value to the home.
Within two years, all the changes Bob made to the house totaled more than $20,000. In that time the value of his home rose almost $100,000. Bob felt he made a good investment. He knew when he sold the home, he would get more money than he paid.

"At precisely 6 a.m., the sound of the alarm clock pierces the air. Sandy drags herself out of bed and begins her morning routine with a quick shower. After her shower, she prepares a simple breakfast. Grabbing a clean bowl from the dishwasher, she empties into it a packet of instant oatmeal. She pours in a cup of milk, stirs and heats the mixture in the microwave. While waiting for her oatmeal to cook, she dresses for the day, mindful of the weather.
 
Fully dressed now, she removes her oatmeal from the microwave, which has now cooled just enough to suit her taste. It is her favorite flavor, apple cinnamon. As she savors each bite, she is reminded of her mother, who always made sure Sandy ate a warm breakfast before leaving the house in the morning.
Checking the time on her phone, she hurriedly swallows the last few mouthful of oatmeal before heading out. As she steps into the street, a gust of wind blows back her hair. She covers her head with the hood of her coat, tightens the scarf around her neck, and braces for her walk to the train station.
After settling into her seat on the train, memories of her mother stir again. She takes out her phone and texts: ""Hey mom, thanks for the scarf you knit me. It came in real handy this morning. Love always.""",B2
"Richard Milhous Nixon was the 37th president of the United States, and the only one to resign from office in the history of the country. Born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, Nixon was a Republican Party member who served as vice president under President Dwight David Eisenhower in the 1950s. Nixon ran for president for the first time in 1960, losing to the very charismatic and young Democrat, John F. Kennedy. The 1960 election was one of the closest elections in history. Kennedy went on to become one of the most popular presidents ever.
 
Despite his loss to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon bounced back in the 1968 election when he defeated Democrat, Hubert Humphrey in a landslide victory. The country was in turmoil during the 60s. The conflict in Vietnam was raging, the country was reeling from the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, and his brother Senator Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Nixon's victory indicated the country was ready for a conservative leadership during these tough times.
Nixon won the 1972 election over Democrat George McGovern in another landslide victory, which seemed to establish Nixon's legacy as a great president. Among his accomplishments was to open trade with China, and his promise to end the conflict in Vietnam. However, Nixon would end up resigning from office just a year after his victory.
It was discovered that the Republican Party, with Nixon's knowledge, had secretly recorded the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. during the weeks leading up to the election. Nixon tried to cover up the scandal, but the pressure was too great. Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace rather than be impeached from office, which means to be removed from office by the U.S. Congress. He became the first president ever to quit while serving in office.",B2
"Mother's Day is a holiday that celebrates and honors mothers in the United States. It is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. It became an official holiday in the country at the start of the 20th century as a way to honor mothers whose sons had died in war.
 
The holiday is celebrated in a number of ways. People give mothers gifts like flowers, cards, and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of the holiday is the carnation. This is because when the holiday first began in the U.S. people were encouraged to wear a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers out for a special meal. In fact, Mother's Day is the most popular date in the U.S. for people to go out and eat and it is estimated that people spend billions on meals and gifts. Mother's Day is also the most popular day to make long distance calls in the U.S. It is the second most popular gift-giving day after Christmas.
Since its establishment, Mother's Day has been criticized for becoming highly commercialized. In fact, the founder of the U.S. holiday, Anna Jarvis, began protesting the holiday and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for demonstrating. Jarvis's own mother started the campaign to establish a mother's holiday during the American Civil War.
Mothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All mother figures including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers are honored on the holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including handmade cards. While widely recognized, Mother's Day is not a federal holiday. Many other countries around the world have their own version of Mother's Day.",B2
"President Bush's top adviser on homeland security is stepping down after 4 1/2 years on the job, the White House said Monday.
Fran Townsend served more than four years as homeland security adviser.
Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend turned in her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6 and will be looking for new opportunities outside government.
 I 'm going to just take another job doing 20-hour days, but this time in the private sector, said Townsend, who has spent 25 years working in law enforcement and government.
Bush praised Townsend's work Monday.
 Fran has always provided wise counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of terrorism, Bush said in a statement. We are safer today because of her leadership. 
Townsend's job, as the president's top adviser on fighting terrorism, involved identifying terrorist groups around the globe and assessing their threat, and finding ways to track and cut off their funding. She said that experience should will be useful in the private sector as well.
Townsend -- the mother of two, ages 6 and 12 -- said she first will look into public speaking, writing and board work before pursuing opportunities in global risk management for a large multinational corporation or financial institution. Watch how Townsend is planning to use her skills 
She said she's been talking with the president about her planned departure for eight months.
Townsend's name had come up during the president's recent search for a new attorney general, but she was not considered. She said not getting the job had absolutely nothing to do with her decision to leave. 
She said Bush had wanted her to stay on in his administration.
 It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service, she said in an e-mail. My family actually advocated that I remain and has always been supportive of my service so this was entirely my decision. 
Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement by the beginning of next year. The president appoints the senior staff position, and it needs no Senate confirmation. E-mail to a friend

"Angelina Jolie was on a stage Thursday but was n't performing. Instead, she paid tribute to the millions of uprooted people across the globe made homeless by war.
Angelina Jolie said that sheltering countries can learn from the way refugees survive their difficulties.
A U.N. goodwill ambassador, Jolie was in Washington to observe World Refugee Day, an annual event that falls on Saturday this year. The poignant ceremony was sponsored by the United Nations refugee agency.
Tears flowed as refugees and displaced people shared their harrowing experiences and advocates related what they 'd seen in refugee camps.
 I believe we must persuade the world that refugees must not be simply viewed as a burden, she said. They are the survivors. And they can bring those qualities to the service of their communities and the countries that shelter them. 
Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan.
She met a boy about 15 years old in a Tanzanian refugee camp who, without a wheelchair, had to crawl since a shot in the back paralyzed him. His family was killed, leaving him as an orphan. Yet when he spoke with her, he did it with a smile.
 He had this really remarkable, unbreakable spirit, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the event at the National Geographic Museum.
 I think of him and I ca n't complain about anything... he was grateful and he had nothing and suffered everything. 
The boy died a few months after she met him, Jolie said.
According to a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees survey of displacement trends in 2008, there are 42 million uprooted people -- 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced people and 827,000 were asylum seekers.
Afghans and Iraqis constituted almost half of all refugees worldwide. One out of four refugees was from Afghanistan, and 69 countries accepted Afghan refugees for asylum, agency officials found.
Jolie recounted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee.
She lived in a small, roofless dirt house in an abandoned refugee camp in Pakistan and could not leave with the others because she was too far along in her pregnancy.
Pakistan struggles with the largest refugee population in the world, about 1.8 million, according to the United Nations. The country also has more than 2 million internally displaced citizens, largely because of the fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban since April.
Antonio Guterres, head of the U.N.'s refugee agency, elaborated on the plight of displaced people at the event.
He said internally displaced people face the same plight -LSB- as refugees -RSB-. They have lost the same as refugees. They do n't have the same international protections granted to refugees. 
Conflicts like those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia have caused more people to flee their homes, though the number of displaced people declined by about 700,000 in 2008, the report said.
Recent fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia last year brought total displacement in each to 1.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively. More than 2 million internally displaced people were in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the report.
When a genocide targeting Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 later spilled over into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rose Mapendo, a Tutsi, was caught in the middle. She spoke at the event and described her ordeal.
Mapendo, her husband and seven children were thrown into a death camp, where her husband was executed and her children starved, she said through tears.
While at the prison, she learned that she was pregnant. She gave birth in silence, on a concrete floor, Mapendo said. To her surprise, she had twins, and to her captorssurprise, she named her newborns after them. Soon after her gesture toward the prison commanders, her family was freed after their 16-month ordeal.
Mapendo, named a CNN Hero in October, created Mapendo International, a nonprofit dedicated to identifying, saving and resettling endangered refugees. She was named humanitarian of the year at the event by the U.N. agency.
 I want to encourage the refugees do n't give up, she said. Giving up is not an option.

"No name evokes more controversy in the United States than O.J. Simpson. He has been in the American spotlight for decades ever since he was a star football player at the University of Southern California, a premier academic university which is primarily known for its full, rich football tradition.
 
USC is one of the greatest places for future pro football players to get their start. Simpson knew this when he transferred to the school in the mid-1960s from San Francisco Community College. At USC, Simpson found fame. His fortune was to come later. He helped the university reach the coveted Rose Bowl berth in 1968, following an outstanding 1967 season where he led the nation in rushing yards. His 64-yard run against arch-rival UCLA, in what many people say was the greatest game in college football history, is what legends are made of. Simpson later played in the National Football League, where he gained more fame and fortune. Upon retirement, he turned to an acting career where he starred in many commercials, and eventually movies.
Unfortunately, Simpson's life took a tragic turn years later. He was accused of murdering his wife, and her friend in the early 90s. His trial was one of the most watched events in the history of television. Simpson was acquitted of the murder, due largely to his ""Dream Team"" of the high-priced attorneys. Many people believed that Simpson committed the murder and got away with it.
Simpson was later convicted in a Nevada court for several offenses, and is currently serving time in prison. Many believe this conviction was retribution for his earlier crimes.",B2
"The last time she took to the stage, the prototype of the mobile phone was undergoing its first trials. Thirty-five years later, as she performs once again, singer Kate Bush is faced with a different world. 
While most concerts are now aglow with phones and tablets, Bush is taking a stand against fans watching her shows through the digital veil of a screen. 
Prior to her highly anticipated series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, Bush released a statement appealing to her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs. 
Bush wrote on her website: ""I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium. It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows. 
""I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras. I know it's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together."" 
With her love of theatrics and opulent costumes, Bush's keenness to stop fans uploading grainy footage to YouTube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have purchased tickets for the 22 dates she is playing. 
Bush is not the first to speak out against the detrimental effect of the presence of phones at concerts, with numerous artists berating their fans for experiencing live music through the filter of a screen. 
The Who front man, Roger Daltrey, recently said it was ""weird"" that people did not have their mind on the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on staring at the screen rather than the artist on stage. 
He said: ""I feel sorry for them, I really feel sorry for them. Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you're doing that, you're 50% there, right? It's weird. I find it weird."" 
In 2013, Beyonce berated one of her fans at a gig for filming. ""You can't even sing because you're too busy taping,"" Beyonce told him. ""I'm right in your face, baby. You gotta seize this moment. Put that damn camera down!"" 
The debate around the presence of phones at live events is not restricted to music, with sport fans equally vocal on the subject. Recently, Dutch fans at PSV Eindhoven launched a vehement protest against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium, holding up banners with messages like ""No wi-fi. Support the team,"" ""You can sit at home,"" and ""Stand united "", while Manchester United have also told fans to leave their ""large electronic devices"" at home, prohibiting filming on tablets this season. 
Jarvis Cocker has previously criticized phone- wielders in the audience for driving him ""insane at concerts"", adding: ""It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that's smaller than the size of a cigarette packet."" 
Johnny Marr said in 2013 that it meant that fans missed out on the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to document the event for later. 
""To stand and just be looking at it through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity. You know, I don't mean to be unkind but I think you should put your phone down because you're just being an idiot, really. Just enjoy the gig,"" he said. 
""That's one of the things about gigs - it's taking in what's going on with the people around you and, watching it on a little screen, it's a waste of time."" 
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs resorted to putting up a sign at one of their venues, pleading with fans to pocket their technology. It read: ""Please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart device/camera. Put it away as a courtesy to the person behind you, and to the band."" 
It has even filtered into the world of classical music, with one of the world's leading pianists surprising concert-goers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and declared: ""The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous."" 
But Sam Watt of Vyclone, a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowd-sourced video of the event, said that such artists were fighting a losing battle and that filming at concerts enhanced rather than detracted from the experience. 
""Fans filming is now part of the concert experience - that is a just a fact - so we take that footage that people are filming at concerts through the app, they upload it onto the app, and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming. You end up with really fantastic content,"" he said. 
""Our overall thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience, rather than taking away from it and I think, if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this and we might be able to win her round,"" he added. ""Knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is really important because it is probably going to hit them on the head in the future if they say to everyone they can't film. You've got to embrace it.""  ",B2
"When sheriff's deputies arrested Casey Anthony in 2008 over the death of her 2-year-old daughter, few would have anticipated it would end like this: just days after her trial, jailers arranging a clandestine release launching the Orlando woman back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger.
But that's precisely the scenario that will play out sometime Sunday when Anthony completes serving her time on four misdemeanor counts of misleading police.
Anthony, 25, was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a wooded field. She was convicted on four counts of misleading police and was sentenced to four years in prison.
After serving nearly three years in prison while awaiting trial, she was ordered released this weekend.
The abrupt end to a criminal case that at times transfixed the nation resulted in anger and revulsion as well as donations of cash to her jailhouse account. It's also led to speculation that the polarizing subject of the I Hate Casey Anthony Facebook page -- and the source of ire for its more than 40,000 fans -- might change her name and appearance and move someplace far away.
 If her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs, they 're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her, that there have been death threats, that she can not just walk amongst the population, HLN legal contributor Sunny Hostin said. That is not just going to happen. 
Whatever she ends up doing, first she has to get out of jail.
Few details have been publicly released about how Anthony will be let out of the Orange County Jail, where she has been held since her arrest in October 2008.
Court officials have released limited information to reporters, mostly plans to bring three journalists inside a secure area of the jail sometime late Friday or early Saturday and cut them off from outside access while they wait for Anthony's release.
When exactly Anthony will be freed has n't been made public.
That's in part likely due to the intense emotions Anthony's release has generated.
 I know it's bad God Forgive me but i hope someone wipes that smirk off her face. With a mack truck, one poster on the I Hate Casey Anthony Facebook page wrote.
Another poster, referencing rumored lucrative interview, book and movie deals, said the only thing she 'd pay to see or read would be about Casey Anthony's dead body. 
The page features Anthony's mug shot with a bullseye target on her forehead under the headline Hey, Casey, I 'd watch out if I were you, just sayin. 
An Oklahoma woman said she has already faced the kind of ire Anthony may face when she's no longer behind the protective walls of the Orange County Jail.
Sammy Blackwell told CNN affiliate KOTV that a woman who mistook her for Anthony on July 8 rammed her car twice, flipping it over.
 She said that I was trying to hurt babies, I was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again, Blackwell told the station.
As it happens, Blackwell has a daughter named Caylee too, but that's the end of the similarities. She says she really does n't even look that much like Anthony and worries for women who do.
Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to Anthony's safety. While he said that the department was not aware of any credible threats to her life, it's a concern that was clearly on his mind.
 Nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands, he said. Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision. I would hope people would step back and would not go out and commit another crime. 
It's also a concern for her attorneys.
 Myself and other members of the team are concerned for her safety, very much so, one of her attorneys, Dorothy Sims, told HLN.
What Anthony will do after her release is unclear.
 Well if I knew at this point I 'm sure you can appreciate that I would n'ttell you, Sims said. I do n't believe that that has been resolved. My hope for her would be that she would be left alone and her privacy would be respected. 
Hostin said on CNN that she's heard reports that Anthony will go into hiding, live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery.
 But I think we are going to hear her story because people have offered her a million dollars already for her story, she said.
Anthony also still has legal issues to deal with.
Her criminal team is appealing her convictions for misleading police, and she is being sued in two separate actions in civil court. One is filed by a woman with the same name Anthony gave to investigators as the name of her daughter's nanny. The other involves a search group that wants Anthony to repay expenses they incurred looking for Caylee.
Anthony may be offered money for book and movie deals, but one offer wo n't be on the table.
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner told CNN's Piers Morgan that the magazine wo n't be offering Anthony a pictorial.
 I would n't reward someone like that for what has happened, Hefner said.
Attorney J. Cheney Mason, who once said he thought of Anthony as a granddaughter, said he does n't know what life holds in store for his client, but has hopes.
 She is only 25 year old. A decade from now, hopefully, she 'll have some stability in her life and maybe a husband, and they can be somewhere in Montana and start over, he said.

"In typical bad-boyfriend style, Dan Sullivan was late to breakfast with the Guardian because he got pulled over on his motorcycle. 
Sullivan works too much, he says. He misses dinner dates. He forgets to give presents. 
And so, like seemingly everyone in Silicon Valley, the 27-year-old venture capitalist has come up with a start-up to fix it: BetterBoyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70. 
Sullivan, who works in finance, has been quietly testing the program and has signed up about 350 boyfriends generating about $17,000 revenue every month. Most members, he says, are from his collection of Harvard and investor friends: venture capitalists, founders and employees of companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, whose girlfriends have been getting presents from Sullivan for the last year. 
Each month, Sullivan's members choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, manicures). The package is sent to the boyfriend unbranded and unlabelled. 
He tests his ideas by buying Facebook ads just to see what kind of traction they get. BetterBoyfriend.me took off. ""BetterBoyfriend hit something,"" Sullivan said. ""It's a pain point everyone has."" 
BetterBoyfriend.me was not Sullivan's first idea. For a couple of days, he thought about a dog-sharing pitch: ""I see all these rich guys looking just miserable walking dogs and I realized: a dog is only valuable 5% of the time,"" he said. ""So, what if we got a guy who would babysit the dogs and other people could rent them out?"" 
Another start-up, called InvisibleBoyfriend, allows users ""to design and build a believable social partner who is everything you want and is always available to talk, whenever you want"". The end result is a ""boyfriend"" who can text with you all day. 
Founder Kyle Tabor launched it to give users a faux boyfriend to deter unwanted advances but has found people have grown attached to their algorithmic partners: ""Many more users are seeking companionship through conversation rather than external 'proof' of a relationship to get people off their back."" 
For Sullivan and Tabor, the surprise was the real relationships that have formed with their customers. Sullivan says he has begun to see himself as a sort of relationship consultant for the boyfriends. 
Sullivan admits he's made mistakes. Early on, the packages included receipts that had his name on them, Dan Sullivan. ""One of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, 'Listen, dude, she's not mad but Cynthia found out'."" 
About 50% of the women BetterBoyfriend.me deliver packages to know about his involvement in their relationships: ""It's correlated with age. I think, after you've been married a while, you don't keep many secrets."" 
And over the year, the young founder says he's got to know the boyfriends really well. They've even done a delivery to a hospital delivery room. The key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the boyfriend. 
When he first launched his company, he attached tags that said BetterBoyfriend.me to flower bouquets and set off for Dolores Park, a popular lounging spot in the tech- and youth-heavy Mission District. 
""I looked for couples and gave the bouquet to the girl but that didn't go down well with the boyfriend. Like, not at all. It made sense, though. It was cool,"" he said. ""So, I reconsidered and started handing them out to the boyfriends.""  ",B2
"California is the largest state in the United States of America. It is home to more than 10 percent of the country's total population. It also has the largest education system in the country. The college and university system is divided into four parts. Those parts are the University of California system, the California State University system, the community college system, and private institutions.
 
The UC system has more than 230,000 students at its 10 Campuses. It is considered the more prestigious system in the state. It includes top universities like UC Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Both schools rank in the top 25 universities in the country, with Berkeley in the top 10. A degree from the UC system is highly sought, and the academic standards are higher than the other systems. They are also more expensive.
The California State Universities counts 23 universities in its system. It is a diversified system that includes two polytechnic universities, and a maritime university. These schools offer vocational and maritime education, but also offer traditional, academic programs. The systems enrollment is approximately 450,000 students, with about 45,000 faculty members.
The California Community Colleges system is the largest systems of higher education in the state, and the world. It boasts 112 campuses, and serves approximately 2.4 million students. It offers transfer degrees, vocational training, and associates degree programs.
California is also home to a large number of privately owned and operated schools. These schools have no ties to the state school system, but some do accept transfer students from community colleges. The most notable and prestigious schools in the state are Stanford University, in Palo Alto, and the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.",B2
"President Obama on Monday gathered together every confirmed member of his Cabinet for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days.
President Obama meets Monday with his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, right.
Agencies will have to report how they saved on expenses at the end of the period.
The federal government has a confidence gap when it comes to the American people, Obama said at the White House.
 We 've got to earn their trust. They 've got to feel confident that their dollars are being spent wisely. 
The edict is part of Obama's commitment to go line by line through the budget to cut spending and reform the government, a senior administration official said.
One potential Cabinet officer was missing from the meeting -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary-designate. The Senate has not voted on whether to confirm Sebelius to the post.
Obama made his savings request as the House of Representatives and Senate were returning from recess this week, ready to start reconciling their versions of the fiscal 2010 budget resolution. The president's budget request is $3.67 trillion. Watch how the administration hopes to cut costs 
In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a small amount, critics said.
 Any amount of savings is obviously welcome, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said. But -LSB- $100 million is -RSB- about the average amount we 'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year. 
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs insisted that ordinary Americans nevertheless would appreciate the savings effort.
 Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money, Gibbs said. It is where I 'm from. It is where I grew up. And I think it is for hundreds of millions of Americans. 
The administration also contends the order signaled an important demonstration of fiscal responsibility.
 None of these savings by themselves are going to solve our long-term fiscal problems, Obama said. But taken together, they can make a difference, and they send a signal that we are serious about how government operates. 
The White House offered examples of how agencies already have started cost-cutting measures, including:

"The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said.
Several rounds of heavy rain lie in store for much of the region the next couple of days, with an additional 2 to 6 inches forecast -- and in isolated cases as much as 10 inches.
This comes on top of the heavy precipitation that already has fallen in the region as the storm, which blew up from the Gulf of Mexico, ran up against an extra-tropical low-pressure system centered across the central Appalachian Mountains and stalled.
 These rains may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, the prediction center said.
A flash flood warning for the District of Columbia remains in effect till midnight tonight, with damaging wind gusts and severe thunderstorms also possible. A news release from the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency urged people to avoid driving when possible, drive very carefully when you must drive, and stay alert for pooling water that you can not drive through. 
Earlier Wednesday, the storm caused a series of air traffic delays across the Northeast. Multiple flights were delayed by over an hour in the New York metro area and by up to 55 minutes in Boston and Philadelphia.
The forecast was unwelcome news for waterlogged Vermont and northern New York, which could receive another 1 to 3 inches of rain with up to 4 inches possible in some spots by Wednesday night.
 We could get flooded again, Robin Stewart of Paterson, New Jersey, told CNN affiliate WCBS. We 're real concerned about that. 
Garbage remained piled outside Stewart's home after flooding from Irene wrecked her lower level, WCBS said. Stewart has n't had power for more than a week, and she is afraid more rain will flood her home again and keep her in the dark even longer.
 When everybody else is on their way to recovery, we 're getting flooded again, Stewart said.
Some eye-popping storm rainfall totals in the Northeast were recorded through 5 p.m. Wednesday in Becket, Massachusetts -LRB- 8.11 inches -RRB-; Rockaway, New Jersey -LRB- 8.43 -RRB-; Phillipsburg, New Jersey -LRB- 7.9 -RRB-; and Forks, Bethlehem and Dover, Pennsylvania -LRB- just over 7 inches -RRB-.
Lee left at least four people dead as it crossed the Southeast, dumping as much as 12 to 15 inches of rain in many places.
In Gwinnett County, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, firefighters said Tuesday they found the body of a man who drowned in a rain-swollen creek near Norcross.
In Baldwin County, Alabama, police said they no longer believe a missing 16-year-old boy is alive. The teen was last seen on a beach near Gulf Shores on Sunday.
A flooding death was also reported in rural northeast Mississippi, where one person drowned after floodwater swept away a vehicle in Tishomingo County, emergency officials said.
And a woman was struck by a tree and killed in Chattanooga, Tennessee, early Tuesday.

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Arsenal kept their slim hopes of winning this season's English Premier League title alive by beating relegation threatened Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor.
A first half goal from Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure Arsenal's hold on second place.
More importantly it took the north London club to within four points of first placed Chelsea, with the two clubs to play next week.
But Chelsea have two games in hand and play lowly Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, a team who are themselves struggling against relegation.
Good form
Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place -- and with it Champions League qualification -- into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title.
After going ahead, Arsenal rarely looked in any danger of conceding, showing more of the midfield pragmatism epitomized by the likes of Francis Coquelin, who also played a crucial role in the goal.
 He has been absolutely consistent in the quality of his defensive work, Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports after the game when asked about Coquelin's contribution to Arsenal's current run.
They have won eight games in a row since introducing the previously overlooked young Frenchman into a more defensive midfield position.
 He was a player who was with us for seven years, from 17, he's now just 24, Wenger explained.
 Sometimes you have to be patient. I am very happy for him because he has shown great mental strength. 
Now all eyes will be on next week's clash between Arsenal and Chelsea which will likely decide the title.
 They have the games in hand, said Wenger, playing down his club's title aspirations.
 But we 'll keep going and that's why the win was so important for us today. 
Relegation dogfight
Meanwhile it was a good day for teams at the bottom of the league.
Aston Villa continued their good form since appointing coach Tim Sherwood with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham, who fired Sherwood last season.
Belgian international Christian Benteke scored the only goal of the game, his eighth in six matches, to secure a vital three points to give the Midlands club breathing space.
Another Midlands club looking over their shoulder is West Brom, who conceded an injury time goal to lose 3-2 against bottom club Leicester City.
But it was an awful day for Sunderland's former Dutch international coach Dick Advocaat, who saw his team lose 4-1 at home against form team Crystal Palace.
Democratic Republic of Congo international Yannick Bolasie scored Crystal Palace's first ever hat trick in the Premier League to secure an easy victory.

"Overall, the two pie charts show that smartphones and tablets are used for the same purposes but to very different extents. 
The first pie chart shows how people spend their time on smartphones while the second pie chart illustrates how time is spent on tablets. For both types of device, the top use is for games, but the figures differ greatly. 57% of the time spent on a tablet is given to playing games, while only 35% of the time spent on a smartphone is used for this. In contrast, smartphone users spend 29% of their time on their gadget accessing social networking sites compared with just 15% of tablet time spent on the same activity.
The third most popular use of the tablet is for consuming entertainment, with users spending 13% of their tablet time watching videos and listening to music. Smartphone users, however, dedicate only 8% of their smartphone time to such entertainment, preferring instead to spend 20% of their time on their phone accessing utilities. These can include maps, weather information and calculators.
There is a clear difference in the way people are using their smartphones and tablets. In general, while tablets are being used more for gaming and other forms of entertainment, smartphones seem to be the preferred option for tasks as well as communication with the world around us.",B2
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognizable celebrities in the United States of America. The Austrian-born star came to the U.S. in the late 1960s when he was an international star in the body-building circuit. Since then, Schwarzenegger has had multiple careers as an actor, politician, and philanthropist.
 
Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. By the time he was 20 years old, he had won the prestigious Mr. Universe title. The professional body-building honor is awarded annually, but this was not his only body-building title on his resume. He won seven Mr. Olympia titles during his body-building career. Additionally, he wrote several books on the subject. His body-building career spanned from 1965 to 1980.
His film career began in 1970 when he starred in a little-known movie called Hercules in New York. However, from these beginnings, Schwarzenegger cultivated a long, and successful career as an action movie star in Hollywood. His movies are some of the most popular films to ever show in the U.S. His most recognizable role was arguably as the Terminator in the film series of the same name. Following a long and successful film career, Schwarzenegger, who was always interested in politics, began a political career that culminated with his election to two terms as California's Governor.
Schwarzenegger was first elected governor in October, 2003, running on a Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his first years, but struggled greatly after that. He had many political opponents who cited that he had no political experience, and had won the elections simply because of his popularity. Schwarzenegger's term in office was rocked by sexual misconduct allegations that tainted his political career. He remains a very popular cultural figure in the United States.",B2
"Van Halen is to Rock 'n' Roll as Cadillac is to automobiles. It is one of the most popular bands ever to perform in the country, and is still going strong 40 years later. It is known as one of the best bands ever to come from a garage-band background. Founded by brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen in their home in Pasadena, California in 1972, the band was one of the top rock acts in the country, and is as popular today as it was then.
 
Eddie Van Halen is considered one of the best lead guitarists in the history of music by many of his peers, while Alex was a superior drummer. Together, they formed the nucleus of the popular band that also included bass guitarist, Michael Anthony, and vocalist, David Lee Roth. The brothers were born in the Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States when they were children. The two were inseparable, and developed an interest in music in the mid-60s. They formed the band in 1972, using the name Genesis. They later changed the name to Mammoth when Eddie discovered Genesis was already in use. Eventually they renamed the band Van Halen.
According to popular legend, Van Halen was discovered by Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss, while they were performing at Gazzarri's on the Strip, a popular spot for heavy metal rock bands in the 70s. They continued to play at gigs throughout Southern California when they released their self-titled debut album Van Halen in 1978. The album peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard list, and the band never looked back. Van Halen's greatest commercial success was from 1978 through 1985, but their albums continue to sell. It has garnered a cult-like following from several, younger generations of American Rock 'n' Roll fans.",B2
"David Cameron, Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused. George W Bush, Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have taken part. As the Ice Bucket Challenge notched up $100m for a US motor-neurone- disease charity and GBP4.5m for a British one, as well as thousands more for charities in Hong Kong and Australia, the bracing cold water of a backlash has quickly followed. 
Narcissistic celebrities showing off toned bodies, people having all the fun without donating, complaints about the waste of water - the attacks have come from commentators, animal-rights groups and environmentalists. And the US Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association - which is not related to Britain's MND Association - also came under fire for the six-figure salaries being paid to its top staff. 
Meanwhile, the challenge continues to grow. For anyone unaware of how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head, or gets a friend to do it, before nominating three people to either do the same or donate. 
It began in the US in July, although whether it was on a golf course or a baseball field depends on which version you prefer, and first appeared on mainstream American television on 15 July. But the ALS Association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" after criticism. ""We understand the public's concern and are withdrawing the trademark applications,"" spokeswoman Carrie Munk said. The ALS has yet to respond to criticism of its high overheads and wage bills. 
The unfortunate coincidence that 31 August to 5 September was World Water Week, with international delegates arriving in Stockholm to discuss the planet's water crisis, has not been lost on some. The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to douse people with sea water. 
Douglas Graham, the MND Association's fundraising director, said: ""The backlash is to be expected but, really, this is just a wonderful windfall and we're so grateful. We didn't see it coming but, suddenly, the donations just started."" The boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating, little- understood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK. 
Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, a longstanding animal-rights activist, wrote an open letter to the ALS Association, saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation. A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of California's drought. Actor Matt Damon got around the problem by pulling up water from his toilets - pointing out that much of the world had less clean drinking water available. Actor Verne Troyer used milk, again citing environmental reasons. And the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay after its 135 inhabitants picked up on the craze. 
In Australia, a TV anchorman apologized over his robust ""no, thanks"" response to being nominated. Lincoln Humphries had said: ""Instead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice, here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world. I'd like to nominate everyone, everywhere, who has more than they need, to donate what they can to the people who need it most ... because that is what charity is about, not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water."" 
Another criticism has been that small charities won't be able to cope with the extra cash, but the MND Association rejected this. ""Oh, we can cope here,"" said Graham. ""We fund world-class research into the causes and, ultimately, to find a treatment or cure. We provide care and support for 3,500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and it's a costly one to manage. Over 50% die within two years of diagnosis. It's heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months."" 
But, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the cash. Graham says it is priceless. Normally, the MND Association gets around 300,000 hits a year on its website. On a single day recently, it had 330,000. 
""We couldn't have created this if we'd tried. Charities are all worthwhile causes and I understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one. In 2013, British people gave GBP62bn to charity - we should be proud of that. It's fabulous for us to get this windfall. We'll be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but, I assure you, every penny will count for good.""

"Just a two-hour detour from Paris, the Loire was once a playground to Renaissance royals. Now its vaunted chateaux are attracting enterprising young couples and artists who have remade them into captivating -- and surprisingly affordable -- inns.
Surrounded by 10-foot-high limestone walls, Le Clos d'Amboise offers an unexpected sanctuary in the town of Amboise.
CHINON
Hotel Diderot
 If you 've never eaten a brioche with fresh Ste. Maure goat cheese, honey and walnuts for breakfast, then you have n't been to the Loire, says Laurent Dutheil, who is justifiably proud of the simple breakfasts he serves at his 23-room hotel in the western corner of the valley.
Dutheil also produces dozens of fragrant artisanal jams such as apple-lavender and quince-cinnamon. -LRB- Sadly, they are n't for sale, but you can buy Dutheil's recipe book, Jam in the Cupboard. -RRB- The traditional foods fit well with the hotel's venerable atmosphere: Diderot is housed in a sprawling 15th-century home that the Chinon-born Dutheil, along with his two sisters, Martine and Francoise, bought and renovated six years ago.

Dutheil tackled structural issues, taking care to keep the exposed oak beams and original stone walls intact, while his sisters refurbished the rooms with cheerful striped wallpaper, toile bedding, and 19th-century armoires they scavenged on trips to Paris. The largest room, which sleeps four, has double windows with views of a courtyard. In the distance lie vineyards full of the red Chinon grapes much loved by 16th-century novelist and satirist Francois Rabelais.

Chateau de l'Isle
The Chateau de l'Isle is quiet to the core -- unless you count the chorus of quacks coming from the duck pond on the 35-acre grounds. The 18th-century manor house had been abandoned for 10 years when Denis Gandon bought it in 1986 and transformed the place into a 12-room hotel.
Still, the chateau somehow feels like a private home: A portrait of Gandon's grandfather hangs over a 100-year-old antique table in the dining area, and an amiable Jack Russell terrier entertains guests with endless rounds of fetch. The stylish bedrooms have exposed wood beams and beds draped with coverlets in shades of crimson and marigold. Budget Travel: See the hotels

Winston Churchill, Harry Truman and Eleanor Roosevelt all, at one time or another, laid their heads at La Roseraie. -LRB- A letter from Roosevelt still hangs in the breakfast room. -RRB-
In 2000, Sophie and Laurent Fiorito acquired the property and completed a top-to-bottom renovation. There is no such thing as a standard room here -- tiny singles have just enough space for a twin bed, while one suite fits a family of five. The decor is equally varied. One room has a Louis Philippe-style dresser and a crystal chandelier; another shows off a modern pink-checkered sofa.

The bedrooms come equipped with decorative elements such as mahogany four-poster beds and original fireplaces, while the common room features wood floors modeled after those at the Palace of Versailles. Most of the rooms overlook the hotel's private park, landscaped with 100-year-old magnolias and a pine tree that survived the French Revolution.
A pool by the rose garden is perfect for a cool dip after relaxing in the wood sauna, housed in a former stable. Just a 10-minute stroll from the hotel stands the riverside castle that belonged to King Francois I -- part medieval fortress, part Renaissance royal house. The king became famously enthralled by Leonardo da Vinci during a 1515 excursion to Italy, and he set up the painter in a gabled redbrick chateau -LRB- now a museum -RRB-, just down the road from his castle.

Auberge de Launay
Between the two of them, Francois and Helene Thevard have honed their hospitality skills at some of the world's most well-respected hotels, including Le Meurice in Paris and the Savoy in London.
After years helping manage other people's properties, the couple -- with their two small kids, Emma and Alexandre -- packed up their Paris apartment and bought an unassuming farmhouse in the secluded hamlet of Limeray to convert to a 15-room inn.
 I grew up in the region, so when we made the decision to open our own place, I knew that I had to come back to the Loire, says Francois. In keeping with the spare design of the house, the decor at the Auberge is simple -- bedrooms are outfitted with neutral suede sofas, blond-wood floors and minimalist photographs of daisies and landscapes.
The duo oversees the daily lunch and dinner service at the on-site restaurant, which serves local specialties such as butter-poached Loire eel and chicken with mustard cream. The house dessert, a salted-caramel fruit tart, is baked with apples picked in the hotel's orchard.

ONZAIN
Chateau des Tertres
This mansion in the heart of the Loire once belonged to the mother of novelist Marguerite Duras -LRB- who mentions the chateau in her famous work The Lover -RRB-. Later, in the 1960s, its marble hallways were filled with students from a nearby engineering school, which used the building as a dorm.
In 1992, another curious owner took over management of the 14-room chateau: Bernard Valois, an artist who kept the mansion's 19th-century detailing -LRB- high ceilings, gilded mirrors -RRB- but added contemporary design flourishes, such as a photograph of a mysterious pair of eyes in the foyer.
Last year, Valois and his wife, Christine, redecorated a former gatekeeper's house as a contemporary four-room cottage with knockoff Jackson Pollock paintings and sculptures that resemble enormous eggs.
 My husband likes to turn things that seem ordinary into the extraordinary, Christine says. He designed a Sputnikbidet that has Japanese robots stationed around the tank. 
Valois also tends a 12-acre garden of roses and clematises, where guests can find a shed stocked with complimentary bikes for exploring the area's 186 miles of riding paths.

"Rangers scored three second-half goals to beat Celtic 4-2 in Glasgow's Old Firm Derby Sunday and go four points clear in the Scottish Premier League.
In-form Steven Naismith fired Rangers ahead with a thumping strike after 22nd minutes but Celtic were quick to level through Gary Hooper's well-worked goal 12 minutes later.
Celtic took the lead just before halftime as Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor allowed a weak shot from Moroccan Badr El Kaddouri to elude his grasp and trickle into the net.
But Nikica Jelavic headed Rangers level seven minutes after the interval and they were ahead when Kyle Lafferty converted after 67 minutes.
Mulgrew, who was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card for his first half challenge, then saw red in the 75th minute and Naismith took advantage against 10 men to score the fourth and his second in injury time.
 I did n't think there was an awful lot between the teams in the first-half. I 'm not sure we deserved to go in 2-1 down but that's what we were faced with, Rangers manager Ally McCoist told Sky Sports.
 We asked the boys for a reaction in the second-half and boy did we get it. 
Celtic manager Neil Lennon was disappointed by his team's second half display: We did n't compete and it was almost as if the players had gone out in the second-half thinking the game was won, he said.
Matches between the two giants of Scottish football usually prove crucial in the domestic title race and the victory left Rangers on 19 points after seven games, with Celtic on 15 in second.

"Saint Patrick's Day, March 17, is a Christian religious holiday that celebrates the patron saint of Ireland. According to the legend, St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to celebrate Irish culture. In major cities across the country like in New York and Boston, there are parades and festivals. People wear green and decorate with shamrocks, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or tee shirts that say ""Kiss me, I'm Irish"". In the U.S. St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, meaning government offices and schools are open.
 
The biggest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually began about 250 years ago before the U.S. was even its own country. Every year thousands gather along to watch hundreds of Irish step dancers and bagpipe players march. Irish step dancing is done in groups or solo. Dancers perform complicated moves with their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies stiff. The parade has also been a source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been allowed to march. Many people protest the parade or boycott it.
St. Patrick's Day has also become associated with the drinking of a lot of alcohol, specifically beer. One drink that is often seen around the holiday is ""Green Beer"". This is really just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel like the holiday celebrates stereotypes about the Irish, like the myth that they all like to drink and get drunk. Others complain that the holiday has become too focused on drinking, with public drunkenness as a problem in major cities around the holiday.",B2
"Sean Edwards, one of Britain's most promising racing drivers, has been killed in a crash at the Queensland Raceway in Australia.
Edwards, 26, was the son of former Formula One driver Guy Edwards and played the role of his father in the recently-released movie Rush.
Edwards was leading the driverschampionship in the 2013 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup season and was taking part in a private training session for young drivers.
The accident occurred when the Porsche 966 car in which he was traveling in as a passenger smashed into a tire barrier.
Guy Edwards was one of three drivers who famously pulled Niki Lauda out of his car before it burst into flames following a crash at the Nurburgring during the 1976 German Grand Prix.
His son had followed him into racing and was highly rated.
Condolences
 Our thoughts are with his family and we want to express our deepest condolences to his relatives, said Hartmut Kristen, Head of Motorsport at Porsche.
Inspector Dave Preston, from Queensland Police, said emergency services had struggled to get Edwards out of the damaged vehicles.
 The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him, he was trapped for some time, he told reporters.
 When I last went down there and he was being removed he -LSB- the driver -RSB- was awake and aware of what was going on around him. 
Edwards began his career in Formula Ford 10 years ago before going on to compete in the Formula Renault UK and British GT.
He won the FIA GT3 Championship in 2006 before making the move to the Porsche Supercup competition in 2008.
Shocking
David Coulthard, the former Formula One driver, took to Twitter to extend his condolences.
He wrote: Shocking news about Sean Edwards passing, top man and super talented racer, condolences to his nearest and dearest. 
The Motor Sports Association -LRB- MSA -RRB- also offered its best wishes to the family, saying it was shocked and saddened by the news.
` Sean was a hugely promising young racer who came through the junior formulas in Britain, before making a career in international sports car racing, read the statement.
 He is leading the 2013 Porsche Supercup championship and had won both the Nurburgring and Dubai 24 Hours this year.
 The MSA extends its deepest sympathies to Sean's family, friends and fans at this difficult time.

"Memorial Day is a United States holiday to remember the men and women who have died while serving in the armed forces. The armed forces include all branches of the U.S. military. Those branches are Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard. Memorial Day is a federal holiday, which means government offices, banks, post offices, and schools are closed. Memorial Day is always observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday, Decoration Day, was established to honor both Union and Confederate soldiers who died. On Decoration Day people used to ""decorate"" the graves of deceased soldiers with flags and flowers. The name Memorial Day became more widely used after World War II in the late 1940s. However, the holiday wasn't officially called Memorial Day until 1967.
 
Memorial Day is commemorated by ceremonies in cemeteries across the country. The most well-known one is held in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, meaning only military personnel are buried there. Volunteers place U.S. flags on military graves at Arlington and other national cemeteries. There are also parades in honor of fallen service people held in different towns and cities. Another Memorial Day tradition is flying the U.S. flag at half staff until noon, meaning it is flown at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of mourning. The flag is raised to its full height after noon as a sign that the military will rise up despite the loss. There is also a national Memorial Day concert that takes place on the lawn of the U.S. Capital.
Memorial Day is also known as the unofficial start of the summer season. Many beaches and pools open up for Memorial Day weekend. Many people also host barbecues on Memorial Day weekend.",B2
"There is perhaps no other director in the American film industry that is more controversial than Michael Moore. Moore's specialty is exposure. He loves to expose social issues. He is a political activist, and a social critic. His films have a way of eliciting strong emotional responses.
 
Moore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1954. His father was an assembly-line worker at the General Motors, an automobile-manufacturing plant; his mother was a secretary. He attended the University of Michigan, Flint campus, where he dropped out after his first year. He found work as a journalist with a couple of different local publications, but was fired from one of his jobs because of a controversy. Moore wanted to run a story about American involvement in Nicaragua, but his editors refused, which led to his dismissal. He was awarded $58,000 in an out-of-court settlement after he sued his employers.
Moore used the money to start making documentaries. His first was ""Roger & Me,"" which was a piece designed to expose GM's closure of the Flint plant and its decision to open a plant in Mexico, where wages were much lower. His film exposes the greed corporations like GM cutting off the lifeline of many American workers so that GM could make more profit. GM had reported record profits before the closure, which irritated Moore greatly.
He followed this film with a string of documentaries that touched on many of the social and political problems Americans face daily. His film ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" probes the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. He is not kind to the George W. Bush administration for their lack of response to the attacks, and to the Bush family's alleged ties to Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind of the attack.",B2
"Golf is one of the most popular games in the United States today. There have been many great champions over the years like Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus, but none has seen success like Tiger Woods. His father was black; his mother was Thai. He was born and lived his early life in Thailand.
 
Woods joined the pro golf tour at the age of 20 in 1996, where he began setting records for winning championships at a young age. He was one of the most promising young stars to hit the tour in years, which led to Woods acquiring several, lucrative contracts with Nike, and Titleist. Woods became a very young millionaire. In 2001, Woods became the first player in history to hold the title in all four major golf tournaments. It seemed there was nothing this young man could not accomplish.
Woods grew up in Orange County, California, and studied for two years at prestigious Stanford University. Woods began playing golf at an early age, and before long was winning amateur championships regularly. He was the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Rookie of the Year in 1996. He has been named PGA Player of the Year, and PGA Tour Player of the Year, 11 times each. He has also led the tour as the biggest money winner several years. He was married, and had two children. His life was presumed ideal, but that changed in 2009.
Woods was exposed as a womanizer by several women, following an alleged affair with a New York woman. Woods denied any wrongdoing, but eventually confessed to several ""indiscretions"". The controversy kept gaining momentum, and it eventually led to his divorce and the loss of endorsement money from the sponsors. Woods is back on the tour, but has not regained his proficiency as before.",B2
"Russian space officials say the crew of the Soyuz space ship is resting after a rough ride back to Earth.
A South Korean bioengineer was one of three people on board the Soyuz capsule.
The craft carrying South Korea's first astronaut landed in northern Kazakhstan on Saturday, 260 miles -LRB- 418 kilometers -RRB- off its mark, they said.
Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said the condition of the crew -- South Korean bioengineer Yi So-yeon, American astronaut Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko -- was satisfactory, though the three had been subjected to severe G-forces during the re-entry.
Search helicopters took 25 minutes to find the capsule and determine that the crew was unharmed.
Officials said the craft followed a very steep trajectory that subjects the crew to gravitational forces of up to 10 times those on Earth.
Interfax reported that the spacecraft's landing was rough.
This is not the first time a spacecraft veered from its planned trajectory during landing.
In October, the Soyuz capsule landed 70 kilometers from the planned area because of a damaged control cable. The capsule was carrying two Russian cosmonauts and the first Malaysian astronaut. E-mail to a friend

"Thailand's rice bowl is now Thailand's nightmare.
The Chao Phraya River delta nourishes the nation's vast rice paddies. But Friday, the river and its many tributaries eyed the capital, Bangkok, like a ferocious animal stalking its prey.
Monsoonal rains have flooded Thailand's plains and now the bursting river threatens to drown Bangkok.
The water has already turned parking lots into marinas, markets into lakes and houses into homes suitable only for fish. It has gushed into houses of the holy -- Buddhist temples stood amid rising water -- and into sanctuaries of the vulnerable.
Fifteen elephants, including seven mothers with babies and a 9-year-old known for its painting skills, are stranded on top of Ayutthaya's Royal Elephant Kraal. The elephants climbed on top of the building last week and are going hungry now that food can only be brought in small quantities on rowing boats. Elephants can swim but the babies might drown in an attempt to escape.
In Bangkok and other deluged cities and towns, the strong carried the feeble on their backs. The young aided the old.
Everyone helped each other.
It was hard to imagine that last year, Red Shirts battled Yellow Shirts in deadly political street protests that prompted a state of emergency in Thailand and left a nation deeply divided.
Disaster brought them back together this week.
An English Facebook page set up to help foreigners in Thailand saw a frenzy of action Friday.

 Both lanes of Bangkruy-Sainoi Rd... flooded 
With 283 people dead and another 8 million affected by the flooding, the fears were real in Bangkok.
Workers stuffed sandbags furiously and shored up barriers. Evacuation centers began to fill with people.
Banjong Palim, 43, said he had never seen anything like this in his lifetime. He was forced to flee when his suburban Bangkok home drowned.
Some recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami that wiped out everything with walls of water. And panicked.
Ed White watched the river flow over containment walls in Ayutthaya. He stacked the furniture as high as he could get it in his house in there, and felt lucky it was made of concrete and brick, not wood, like so many traditional Thai homes.
White grew up in Ocean City, Maryland. He was used to hurricanes and the Atlantic's fury. But this was different.
The water was not raging. There were n't torrents.
It just kept inching upward. Slowly, but surely.
At the market where White gets his hair cut, people scurried, spreading rumors born from fear. In two hours, they said, everything would be under water. The flood was coming ! The flood was coming !
White moved to Thailand in 2003 to work for a rubber company. Friday, he said he had moved into a second-floor company apartment in Bangkok, confident he would be safe there. Meanwhile, his employer had made a fortress out of the rubber factory, erecting concrete barriers around everything as though it were a war zone.
For many it was a losing battle.
The military helped evacuate them, whisking them away by boat or carrying them through chest-high water.
Just about every day now, rain has come down hard, exacerbating worries. This is already the worst flooding Thailand has seen in decades. Some wondered Friday how much worse it could get.
The government's Flood Relief Centre chief said that Bangkok would be spared. But with a chance of thunderstorms in the forecast for the next few days, reassurances Friday were difficult to swallow.

"he United Nations, an international organization founded in 1945 after the Second World War by 51 countries, has its headquarters along the East River in New York City. Technically anyone who visits UN Headquarters is not in New York anymore. They are not even in the United States. That is because the land and buildings are considered international territory. The United Nations has its own flag, its own post office and its own postage stamps. There is no need to change currency, however. The UN uses the U.S. Dollar. Six official languages are used at the United Nations. They are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. UN rules override the laws of New York City. This does not mean that people can commit crimes there and get away with it. There is no immunity to those who commit crimes there.
 
The property where the United Nations now stands used to belong to a slaughterhouse. The current buildings were completed in 1952. The perimeter of the UN is lined with flagpoles with the flags of all 193 UN member states and the UN flag. They are arranged in alphabetical order in English.
Some may think it's great to be a neighbor to a peacekeeping agency like the UN. Many New Yorkers don't always think so though. Every time a dignitary like a president or prime minister visits, streets are closed, making it hard to get around and to find parking.
You don't need to be a diplomat to visit the UN though. There are tours Monday through Friday and not just in English. Guided tours are available in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Visitors can have a meal at the Delegate's Dining Room featuring a buffet of food from all over the world.",B2
"Anti-China protesters gathered Saturday in Tokyo and six other major cities in Japan to rally against what it calls an invasion of disputed islands that both claim are part of their territories.
Protesters held up Japanese flags and chanted, We will not allow Communist China to invade our territory. 
Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countriesclaims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku.
The rally was organized by Toshio Tamogami, a former Japanese chief of staff for the Self Defense Force.
Japan rejects China's demand for an apology
 Senkaku Islands is Japan's traditional territory, Tamogami said. If we do n't protect it, China will make action to take it. 
Tamogami called China a thief and vowed to protect the islands.
Beijing and Tokyo have been clashing over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan off the disputed islands.
The captain was accused of hitting two Japanese coast guard ships and obstructing public officers while they performed their duties.
 I am very angry with China, said student Shohei Fukumoto.
China should apologize and pay for the repair of the vessel because the captain was in Japan's territory when the accident happened, according to Fukumoto.
Japan has since freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China.
Yoko Sakamoto, 55, said Japan has been too easy on China.
 I 'd like to criticize Japanese government's weak attitude toward China and Senkaku Islands issue, rather than China itself, Sakamoto said. We should get our national pride back. 
The captain's arrest prompted the suspension of diplomatic talks and canceled trips between the nations.
Beijing has sought an apology and compensation over the arrest, which Tokyo has rejected.
Japan has also demanded compensation for damage done to coast guard ships.

"Since 2008, Barack Obama has been president of the United States of America. He is a historic figure primarily because he is the first African American to hold the position of president. His policies have gained him many supporters, as well as many detractors. He is possibly one of the most divisive presidents to govern the country in the history of the United States. Obama is a representative of the Democratic Party with his presidency coming after the controversial George W. Bush left office.
 
One of the defining aspects of his presidency is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly and inaccurately called Obamacare. This act, passed into law by the U.S. Congress and signed by the president in March 2010, became effective on January 1, 2014. It is the single, most significant change in government healthcare since Medicare was implemented in 1965. This act was intended to increase the affordability of care for Americans, expand insurance coverage, and lower the uninsured rate in the country. It is a controversial act that has many detractors, but most Americans now carry health insurance, which was not true before 2014.
Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961. He is a graduate of both Columbia University in New York City, and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he served as senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many southern conservatives, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the Affordable Care Act, and his attempts at immigration reform. Additionally, Obama ended the U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. He also ordered the military operation that eventually resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. Obama was reelected as president in November, 2012.",B2
"It has been called 'the hotel of mum and dad' but few guesthouses have such favourable terms. As the housing crisis bites, a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep. A recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country, from just under 9% in the East Midlands to more than double that in London, where house prices and rents are highest. While many around the country contributed financially, the survey found that 20% were paying nothing at all. 
Young adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents, which have hit record highs, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder. Research published by the homeless charity Shelter showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit, while a quarter could only put by GBP100 or less each month. Mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits. 
Faced with this, young adults are increasingly returning to the family home in order to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their offspring a lump sum seem willing to help. The survey found that 28% of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit. However, it also found that 30% were not saving any money. 
A spokesman for the company conducting the survey commented: ""The hotel of mum and dad is often staying open for longer than many anticipated, our latest research shows. Rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit mean that some children understandably have to wait before flying the nest. And, for some, moving out may never be an option."" 
Michael Day, 30, who lives with his parents in Bristol, says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit. Rents for a one-bedroom home in the city are between GBP500 and GBP800 a month, while buying a similar property would cost about GBP130,000. ""I don't really want to move out to rent as it's more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so it's been a bit of a vicious circle."" 
Day does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited. At home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job at a candle retailer. He plays golf at county level and he admits that, instead of saving, he spends his spare cash on golf and holidays. ""You need so much money that I will have to save for the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""Because it's been so difficult, I've been going on holiday and enjoying it."" 
Sue Green, of Saga, a business that sells insurance and products to the over-50s, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their 20s or 30s. ""Most will be more than happy to house them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,"" she said. ""Children who don't pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries, family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home."" 
Angus Hanton, co-founder of a thinktank called the Intergenerational Foundation, said older generations were ""the architects of the housing crisis"" and children should not be blamed for staying at home. ""The under-30s have suffered a fall in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn. Rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules have been tightened for the young but not for older buy-to-let investors, who squeeze out the young,"" he said. ""Student-fee debt is rising rapidly yet many jobs on offer - zero- hour and short-term contracts - are turning younger workers into second-class citizens. Rather than blaming the young, we should be standing up for their interests so they can afford to build lives of their own."" 
Jenna Gavin, 29, lives in Southport, Merseyside, in the family home where she grew up. She moved out for a year to go to university but has been living with her parents ever since. She works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area. But renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than GBP420 a month before bills, which would take up a lot of her earnings. ""I don't want to rent - I don't want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end,"" she said. ""I've looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but I just can't borrow enough to get on the property ladder."" 
Gavin is trying to save but is struggling to amass the necessary funds. ""You don't really see it building up as much as you need - even a 5% deposit is such a lot of money and I would like to put down more,"" she said. Her parents are happy not to charge her rent. ""They want me to try to save up and I contribute in other ways - I bring food in and I do things around the house."" 
Gavin gets on with her parents and has her own space in a room that she moved into when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own place by the time she was 30. ""I don't see that happening as it's next year. But, hopefully, in a couple of years, I'll have moved out.""

"When parents send their children to school, often they don't know what happens day to day. Parents rely on what their children tell them about how they are doing and what they are learning. Generally schools will host parent-teacher conferences at least twice a year. Parent-teacher conferences are short meetings between parents and their children's teachers. Usually parent-teacher conferences are held when teachers give out a student's grades for the term. The parent-teacher conferences give teachers an opportunity to let parents know how their child is doing. A teacher will let a parent know the student's strengths and bring to the parent's attention any problems with grades or behavior. The meetings also offer parents the opportunity to ask questions and see what their child is learning.
 
When it is almost time for parent-teacher conferences, the school will send parents a note and usually give them an appointment time. There are appointments during the day and in the evening. Evening appointments are used for parents who work during the day. Parent-teacher conferences do not last very long. Normally they do not last longer than 10 minutes. This is why it is important for parents to make sure they arrive at their appointments on time and come prepared with questions. If a parent needs more than 10 minutes, he or she should try to schedule another meeting with the teacher. Keeping a teacher for more than 10 minutes when there are parents waiting is disrespectful.
Most children do not go along with their parents to the meetings. This allows both the parent and teacher to talk honestly about the child's progress without making the child feel bad. Usually a teacher will offer advice to the parent on how to support their child's education.",B2
"including a private gym. The seven-deck superyacht also comes with two pools, numerous jacuzzi, and a hair stylist and barber.
Yet in a global climate of haves and have-nots, is it morally justifiable to spend $1 billion on a private yacht catering for 36 guests ?
 To be honest, what ordinary mortals think is moral,is not actually relevant to these people, said Kampfner.
 You have to understand that we 're not talking about the top 1 % -- in this instance we 're talking about the 0.01 %. This is a tiny group who live in their own bubble, they mix only among themselves. 
Timm sees things differently, pointing to the employment opportunities created during the building and running of the superyacht.
 The boat will take approximately two to three million human hours to build -- not counting all the worldwide subcontractor hours, or the ready-made items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht, he said.
 Building the yacht at the shipyard will directly employ, at the minimum, 500 people for a period of three years. These people, who have families to support and feed, will be gainfully employed.
 And this does not include the 50 to 70 people who will work on the yacht and will be employed full time by the yacht owner, as well as others who supply the yacht. 
He extends this reasoning to the media -- You, the journalist, benefits from this build indirectly by being gainfully employed by CNN for writing this story. 
And you, the person reading this story ? Kampfer sees the public's interest in the lifestyles of the super rich as a type of luxury porn.
 There is an enormous sense of injustice which is shared not just by the poor, but also by the middle class, towards the global super rich, he said.
 But together with that however, is a sense of envy and ogling. So whether you call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever it might be -- we both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them.

"John Lennon is one of the most complex individuals ever to walk the face of the earth. The British-born musician is a true international icon who influenced the world with his message of peace and love. In America, Lennon is one of the most loved people to ever call the United States home.
 
Lennon was one of the founding members of the international super group, the Beatles. He, along with Paul McCartney, formed the early creative brain trust of a group that changed music worldwide. The group's success has never been duplicated, and its music is as popular today as it was in the 1960s and 70s.
Lennon wrote, or co-wrote some of the most memorable tunes ever written in the Rock 'n' Roll genre. He found great success as a member of the Beatles, which is the most commercially successful group in history, and as a solo artist. Lennon was also a political activist. His views on religion and politics caused a great deal of controversy in the United States. He was an outspoken critic of the country's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. His popularity caused great concern with government officials because he had the attention of the young people in America at the time.
Lennon had been living in New York for several years, where he was being watched by the FBI in order to find grounds to deport him from the United States. He used flamboyant gimmicks to spread his word of peace. In this passive protest, Lennon and his wife Ono addressed the media from their beds claiming people should ""make love, not war."" Lennon was killed on December 8, 1980 by a crazy gunman outside his home in New York City. A memorial plaque at the site of his death is one of the most visited sites in the country.",B2
"Today has been a difficult day filled with arguments.
I left university after completing my graphic design course in the
summer. Until then I had lived in various subsidised university
accommodation over four years. So leaving a sheltered life and
having to find accommodation in the market place was a real
shock. We decided, two girls and two boys, to find a flat, and I
volunteered to speak to the flat-owners.
At first sight one would think that our university town would be
an easy place to find accommodation. All the heavy industry and
manufacturing industries closed down a couple of decades ago
and many people moved away to find work, so compared with the
country as a whole house prices are low here. Flats of various
sizes are available, but finding a cheap flat of a reasonable size
affordable for four young people was challenging.
Like any sizeable town, ours has districts with different housing. Goldmark in the west contains
most of the wealthy housing and we didn't bother looking there. Newtown way out to the south
is mostly prefabricated housing blocks with high levels of unemployment but very little going on
at the cultural level. After eliminating those areas, we confined our search to Babylon in the east
with its multicultural background.
Of the four of us three were living on savings and welfare payments. Paul, one of the boys,
had a night job working in a twenty-four hour mini-supermarket in the town centre. Our poor
economic profile meant that flat owners were reluctant to rent to us, fearing that we would
default on our rent payments. In the end we claimed to have jobs that we did not. If we hadn't
done so, we wouldn't have found anywhere.
By far the most disturbing aspect during our search was the run-down character of so much of
the property on offer. Much of it fell far below legal standards: the gas and electricity systems
were poorly maintained and the sewage systems were below standard. Usually these properties
were meagerly furnished and were extremely dirty. We had to choose the least worst option
which was a three-roomed flat on the fourth floor of a tenement building.
We moved in today. The landlord asked for a thousand Euro deposit and three months rent in
advance. With great difficulty we complied. The place is filthy and I have drawn up a list of work
that needs to be done to make the place liveable. As we only have three rooms we drew lots
to see who would end up with the kitchen: the other girl, Dora, chose the short straw. Well, she
can make cups of tea during the night.
Anyway I must sign off now as I have work to do.

"Supporting a congressional campaign usually means donating money, knocking on doors and making phone calls. Rarely does it mean acting like a nudist in a television ad that will be played throughout your community.
That is, until the Kelly Kultala for Congress campaign asked exactly that from their supporters.
Kultala, a Democrat running to oust Kansas Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, released an ad on Thursday that featured a handful of seemingly naked people urging viewers to support the Democrat in November's election.
The people in the ad, however, are not actual nudists. They are supporters of the Kultala campaign who agreed to appear on TV with different objects in front of their naked bits.
 They are volunteers who agreed to do it because they support our campaign and our message, said Jacob Becklund, the Kultala campaign manager. It should also be noted that nobody was actually nude during filming. 
According to Becklund, It was a pretty easy sell to all of our volunteers, even though the ad -- which comes with a high five figure -LRB- cost -RRB- behind it -- will be seen on cable and broadcast in the Kansas City market starting Friday.
The -LRB- faux -RRB- nudity in the ad -- titled Naked Truth -- was a knock on Yoder, who in 2011 skinny dipped in the Sea of Galilee in Israel, a decision for which he was reprimanded by House Republicans in 2012.
 Awhile back, Congressman Yoder made news by skinny dipping on the job, Kultala says in the ad. But it is more shameless what he is doing to Kansas. 
The ad then features the seemingly naked volunteers citing different aspects of Yoder's record, including that Yoder lines the pockets of his millionaire donors with big tax cuts. And they line his, when he has pockets. 
 We thought it was a humorous hook, Becklund said, to get people to pay attention to the message.

"One of the most divisive eras in American history is the Vietnam era. The Vietnam era for the United States ran roughly from 1960 through 1975. In the mid to late 60s, America's involvement became a huge issue. The conflict in Vietnam was divisive for many reasons, but mostly because of the public's perception that it was an immoral and illegal operation. The other major factor was that the U.S. was still engaged in drafting young men into the service of the country against their will.
 
One of Hollywood's major film stars of the time was Jane Fonda. Fonda came from Hollywood movie royalty, being the daughter of the great actor, Henry Fonda. She won two Oscars, seven Golden Globe awards, and an Emmy award through her long career. In the 60s she was a political activist who was against the war in Vietnam. She was very outspoken against the conflict, as many celebrities were at the time.
In 1970, Fonda made headlines for a very different reason. She and two fellow actors starred in an anti-war film that drew much controversy. In July of 1972, Fonda drew the wrath of many Americans when she was photographed sitting with North Vietnamese Army members on an anti-aircraft gun. That image soiled her reputation as an actress, and as a true American. Many called Fonda a traitor for interacting with the enemy. Years later, Fonda said that she was manipulated into taking that photo, but many Americans still have their doubts.
During her trip to North Vietnam, which was at war with the U.S. backed South Vietnam, Fonda made a number of radio broadcasts denouncing America's involvement in the war. This further cemented her image as a traitor. However, there are many Americans who feel she was a true patriot because she refused to stand still and spoke out against the war.",B2
"Malian authorities have found a mass grave containing 21 bodies thought to be soldiers killed while a junta chief was in power after a 2012 military coup, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said Wednesday.
Investigators found the bodies in a grave close to a military camp in the village of Diago, just north of Bamako, spokeswoman Alasane Diarra said.
Last week, Gen. Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 2012 coup, was arrested, charged with complicity in kidnapping.
A failed counter-coup shortly after he seized power pitted two army factions against each other: the green berets loyal to Sanogo and the red berets loyal to ousted President Amadou Toumani Toure.
 At the military camp in Diago, there were both green berets and red berets soldiers. We do not know which group the soldiers in the grave belonged to, Diarra said.
Investigations into alleged kidnapping and killings after the military takeover that plunged the West African country into chaos have been ongoing since April 30, 2012.
 The investigators have been working on the case since April, so just after the coup. They have known about the grave for a while, but when they finally went there and opened the grave, there were more bodies than they previously thought, Diarra said.
The bodies are all male and from different ethnic groups, she said.
As the bodies are removed from the grave, forensic investigators will start the process of identifying the men.
 Families of soldiers who disappeared during the coup will be asked to come and identify their family members, Diarra said.

"1 Passing clouds 
One of the pleasures of flying is seeing clouds close up. Even though they seem insubstantial they carry a considerable weight of water - around 500 tonnes in a small cumulus cloud. And water is denser than air. So why don't clouds fall out of the sky like rain? They do. But the droplets take a long time to sink. An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre. 
2 On cloud nine 
Most of us are happy to label clouds ""fluffy ones"" or ""nasty black ones "", but meteorologists identify more than 50 cloud types based on shape and altitude. These fit into categories given numbers from one to nine. Cloud nine is the vast, towering cumulonimbus, so to be ""on cloud nine"" implies being on top of the world. 
3 Around the rainbow 
There's no better place to see a rainbow than from a plane. Rainbows are produced when sunlight hits raindrops. We see a bow because the Earth gets in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle. When passing over clouds, the plane's shadow appears neatly in the centre of the effect. 
4 Mr blue sky 
Sunlight is white, containing all the colours of the spectrum but, as it passes through air, some of the light is scattered when it interacts with the gas molecules. Blue light scatters more than the lower-energy colours, so the blue appears to come from the sky. 
5 There's life out there 
Apart from clouds and other planes, we don't expect to see much directly outside a flying aircraft's window, but the air is seething with bacterial life - as many as 1,800 different types of bacteria have been detected over cities and they can reach twice the cruising height of a plane. 
6 Turbulence terror 
Even the most experienced flyer can be turned green by turbulence. The outcome can be anything from repeated bumping to sudden, dramatic plunges. The good news for nervous flyers is that no modern airliner has ever been brought down by turbulence. People have been injured and occasionally killed when they are not strapped in, or get struck by poorly secured luggage - but the plane is not going to be knocked out of the sky. 
7 In-flight radiation 
When body scanners were introduced at airports there were radiation scares but the level produced is the same as passengers receive in one minute of flight. The Earth is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays, natural radiation from space that has more impact at altitude. 
8 You can't cure jet lag 
The world is divided into time zones. The result is that long-haul travel results in a difference between local time and your body's time, causing jet lag. However, its effects can be minimized by keeping food bland for 24 hours before travel, drinking plenty of fluids and living on your destination time from the moment you reach the aircraft. 
9 Supersonic 747s 
Many of us have travelled faster than sound. There are a number of jet streams in the upper atmosphere, notably on the journey from the US to Europe, where a temperature inversion causes a corridor of air to move as fast as 250mph. If an airliner with an airspeed of 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be to fly at 800mph, above sound's 740mph. 
10 Flying through time 
Time zones provide an artificial journey through time - but special relativity means that a flight involves actual time travel. It's so minimal, though, that crossing the Atlantic weekly for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future. 
11 Terrible tea 
Don't blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn't great. Water should be just under 100degC when it is poured on to tea leaves - but that isn't possible on a plane. It's impossible to get water beyond 90degC during flight - so choose coffee. 
12 I can't hear my food 
Airline food has a reputation for being bland and tasteless. Some of the problem may not be poor catering, though. A plane is a noisy environment and there is evidence that food loses some of its savour when we are exposed to loud noises. 
13 Needle in a haystack 
With modern technology, it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear without a trace - yet, finding a missing aircraft is a needle- in-a-haystack problem. The plane knows its location, both from GPS and inertial tracking, but this information is not relayed elsewhere in real time. That would be perfectly possible. Ocean- going ships have had tracking since the 1980s - the limitation is not technology but a lack of legislation requiring it. 
14 Volcanic fallout 
Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. Glass-like ash particles melt in the heat of the engine, then solidify on the rotors. A clear-skies policy in an ash cloud may be inconvenient - but the risks of ignoring the ash are clear. 
15 The wing myth 
For many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. In fact, almost all a plane's lift comes from Newton's Third Law of Motion. The wing is shaped to push air downwards. As the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push upwards, lifting the plane. 
16 Forget electric planes 
When we see ultra-light, experimental, electric planes, it's easy to assume there will soon be clean, green, electric airliners, but it won't happen any time soon. Aircraft fuel packs in a remarkable amount of energy. Batteries are much less efficient. To provide the same energy as a tonne of fuel would take 100 tonnes of batteries - and a 747 uses 150 to 200 tonnes of fuel. Unless battery technology is made vastly more efficient, electric airliners won't get off the ground. 
17 Beware the vortex 
Pilots often wait a long time to get clearance. This is to allow the air to settle after a previous take-off, as a plane's wingtips generate vortices in the air, which can take two or three minutes to disperse. If the following aircraft set off immediately, the rapidly moving air would make the plane difficult to handle. The delay gives the air time to recover from the miniature whirlwinds caused by the preceding plane. 
18 The doors aren't locked 
In practice, the doors on a plane don't need to be locked. If you watch an aircraft door being opened, it swings in an unusual way. It first has to be opened inwards before manoeuvring it out of the way. Once the plane has taken off, a significant pressure difference soon builds up between the inside of the plane and the outside. This differential forces the door into place. To open it, you would have to pull against the air pressure, well beyond the capabilities of human muscles.

"Transformers actress Megan Fox said yes to ex-fiance Brian Austin Green's marriage proposal, just four months after calling off a two-year engagement with Green, her publicist confirmed.
Fox, 24, was so excited when Green, 36, popped the question on a Hawaii beach that she dropped the 2-carat diamond engagement ring into the sand, Us Weekly magazine reported.
Despite a lengthy search by hotel staffers, the ring was never found, the magazine reported.
Fox and Green began dating six years ago and became engaged for the first time in 2007. They broke it off last February.
Marriage may be easier for Fox now that she's out of the Transformers franchise. Director Michael Bay announced this month that she is being replaced as Shia LaBeouf's love interest by model-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for Transformers 3. 
Fox portrayed Mikaela Banes in the first Transformers and its sequel Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. 
Green spent a decade playing David Silver on the hit TV series Beverly Hills, 90210 until it was canceled in 2000.

"Labor Day is observed on the first Monday of September. It is a holiday meant to honor the contributions, both economic and social, of U.S. workers. It has been an official federal holiday since 1894, meaning that government offices including post offices and schools are closed.
 
It is also widely thought that Labor Day was created as an alternative holiday to May Day. May Day, especially in the 1800s, had become a protest day, when workers marched to demand better rights and working conditions. There were often strikes that ended in violence. At the time, the U.S. government was afraid that May Day was being led by communists and was having a bad influence on workers. Some people feel September was also chosen since there are no other holidays between Fourth of July and Thanksgiving in November.
On Labor Day there are usually parades in major cities around the country. Politicians and labor leaders make speeches and hold press conferences. Labor Day is also considered the unofficial end of summer. Many people celebrate Labor Day with trips to the beaches, picnics, and barbecues. Many towns and cities host fireworks on this day. Many people also take their last summer vacations around this time. Labor Day is also the beginning of the professional and college football season in the U.S.
Labor Day has also become an important retail holiday. Many stores have Labor Day sales to coincide with the start of the school year for many children in the U.S. This means that many store workers, while their holiday is being celebrated, have to work long hours.",B2
"It's well known the fashion industry is one of the toughest to break into. To conform to the traditional stereotype of a model you need to be skinny, stunning and have legs that go on forever, right ?
Try telling that to Refilwe Modiselle -- she's breaking all the rules while sashaying down the catwalk as Africa's first albino model.
 I was being tenacious and saying no, wait a minute. This is a different representation of what African beauty is, Modiselle tells CNN.
 You 're told that a black child should be brown-skinned, but what do you then call a girl like myself ? I 'm not tall either. But there I was modeling with the likes of your Adiambo's, your famous models that have really done well. 
In 1999, Modiselle was just 13 years old when she was first approached to do a five-page shoot for a youth magazine aiming to showcase how the African fashion landscape would change with the turn of the millennium. It was her first taste of fashion, but she got the bug.
Yet it would n't be until she finished her high school education and entered college -LRB- at the behest of her mother -RRB- that Modiselle found herself in front of a camera again.
Redefining beauty
The move kickstarted her career and soon the South African student was staring back at herself from glossy magazine pages and gliding down runways at high-profile events, like Mercedes Benz Africa Fashion Week.
 I was defying everything about what society says defines a model. I 'm basically saying OK, let's teach our kids a different definition of beauty, or a definition that's always been there but has just always been disregarded. 
Albinism is an inherited condition caused by a lack of melanin, a pigment in skin, hair and eyes. While it is fairly common globally -- one in every 17,000 people are born with some form of the genetic disorder -- albinos across Africa are often subject to discrimination and even, in some countries, hunted and killed because of their appearance.
 People with albinism are often not given the opportunity to get into such industries because we 're not known as extroverts, we 're not given a chance to be identified in society as people who have the potential to represent something, she says.
Identity crisis
But Modiselle does n't just have to live with the unspoken threat of discrimination hanging in the air. Born in Soweto, the feisty, young model has, at times, struggled with her identity.
The 28-year-old explains: South Africa has a history of apartheid, where race is such a big segregation. How do you then place yourself ? You are a girl who is born in a black society: the township. And now you have to fit into a world where, you 're told: this is black, this is white and you 're in a country that is constantly fighting these aspects. It's something that is not easy because people try and place you and identify you in a specific way. 
Cementing her status as a household name, she also spends one day a week filming a current affairs talk show with fellow South African television personalities Masechaba Lekalake and comedian Tol Ass Mo..
Participation in the show allows Modiselle to reveal more of her personality to the country, and to show she's more than just a clothes horse. Though she's not even 30, Modiselle is already thinking about her legacy.
 I will teach through the things that I do. -LRB- My -RRB- plan for the future is just to grow myself as a brand and as an entity: to touch the world in different places and to be able to be a huge representative for Africa.

"Stepping on the London subway train five years ago, the thirtysomething marketing manager never imagined her morning commute might eventually lead to the Paralympic Games. Now, that's exactly where Britain's Martine Wright is setting her sights.
Wright lost both legs when a suicide bomber blew himself up on a subway train near London's Aldgate station on the morning of July 7, 2005. She also suffered a fractured skull and severe arm injuries.
Though she was one of the most seriously hurt that day, Wright is now aiming for a spot on the British Paralympic volleyball team in 2012.
 I would love, absolutely love, to be part of the Paralympics in 2012, Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month. I mean, if you had said that to me five years ago, I would have thought that you were absolutely mad. But to go back to London, where I was born, and to do something so positive -- after I left on such a negative -- would be absolutely amazing. 
Four bombs were set off that day in July, on three subway trains and a bus. Fifty-six people were killed, including the four bombers, and more than 770 were wounded.
The bombings happened the day after the International Olympic Committee announced London would be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012.
Wright said she made a promise to herself and her family after the attacks to grab every single opportunity that she could.
 I think I 've done more now than what I did before, she told ITN. I 've learned to fly planes, and I 've jumped out of a plane, learned to ski again. 
She competed for -- and won -- a place on Britain's sitting volleyball squad. The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
Some 640 athletes from 20 countries are taking part in the event, the biggest major international competition before London 2012, according to Lisa Wainwright, chief executive of Volleyball England, the sport's national governing body.
John Bestebroer, the head coach of the women's team, calls the championships a great training opportunity for 2012. 
Sitting volleyball is a version of the sport that allows anyone to participate, including those with a disability. The men's event has been part of the Paralympics since 1980 and the women's since 2004, according to British Volleyball.
International volleyball rules apply in the sitting version, with certain amendments for disabled players: During play, a player must touch the court with some body part between the buttocks and the shoulders, and players are allowed to block serves. Also, sitting volleyball is played on a smaller court with a lower net.
Wright told London's Evening Standard that the 2012 Games will have an added poignancy because her last real memory before the bombings was celebrating with colleagues when London was chosen to host the Olympics.
She was the last person pulled from the station that day, and Wright said she feels she's one of the lucky ones.
 Even on your darkest days, there will always be someone that's worse than you are, unfortunately, Wright told ITN. There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, 'cause I 'm still here.

"A 4-year-old Ohio girl who vanished more than three weeks ago was found alive and in good condition, halfway across the country in southern California, authorities said.
Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter.
Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said. He was being sought by the U.S. Marshal's Service.
Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said. She was doing well but may have chicken pox, he added.
 We understand she is healthy and happy and I believe, waiting to come back to her grandmother here, he said. Watch authorities announce their find 
The journey west took them more than two thousand miles from Mansfield, the north-Central Ohio city where the girl and her mother live.
 I am very happy that my granddaughter's coming home, said Mary Watson, Haylee's grandmother. And I just want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart. 
Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and held by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. When asked their reaction, Elliott said, I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them. 
Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said.
Watson's hair was a bit darker and Potter also changed his appearance slightly.
Authorities had feared Haylee was endangered. Potter, a sex offender, had escaped a half-way house on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight.
Countless tips came in while they were missing but one in particular led to the breakthrough on Tuesday, Elliott said without elaborating.
But a tip from members of the ranch could have lead to the raid and arrest, a ranchmember told CNN.
Kevin Carlin, a member of the ranch in the neighborhood of Valley Center, told CNN in a telephone interview that ranch members became suspicious when a former ranch guest saw billboards urging help in finding Haylee and the two adults.
Elliott also praised intense national news coverage from programs such as HLN's Nancy Grace and Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell, as well as local media and Clear Channel, which put up missing child billboards across the country.
When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said. The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 27-year-old Potter.
Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation. He is a convicted tier three sex offender, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, a unit of the Justice Department.
While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield. Haylee was not on that video.
Adding to concerns, Watson's roommate, Samantha Covert, said last week in an interview on Nancy Grace that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared. Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing, pillows and blankets.
Watson will likely face state charges, including harboring a fugitive, according to Elliott.
In addition to other charges, he said Potter may be prosecuted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a multi-year felony sentence if violated.
On its Web site, the Morning Star Ranch describes itself as a community of growers of organic, pesticide-free avocados, grapefruit, persimmons, nuts, and other produce. 
Elliot said he believed it is a rehab facility and also called it a Christian retreat.

"Two of Turkey's main political parties are pushing for a constitutional amendment to lift bans on headscarves at public universities, a move that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.
The lifting of the ban on headscarves has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the move, saying it would create equality in Turkey's higher education.
The constitutional commission will discuss the proposal -- submitted by the AKP and MHP parties -- in the coming days before sending it to the floor for a vote.
If approved, it would need President Abdullah Gul's approval, which is expected.
Under the proposal, veils, burqas or chaddors -- all of which cover a woman's face -- would not be allowed.
Bans on headcoverings were imposed in the early 1980s by Turkey's universities because they were seen as political symbols and conflicted with Turkey's secular governing system.
The proposal to change Turkey's constitution sent chills through Turkey's secular population. Women's groups went to parliament Tuesday to voice their rejection.
 This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations, said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP.
Another CHP lawmaker said she fears that if the proposal is enacted, parents will feel pressure to have their daughters wear headscarves, even in elementary school.
Mustafa Akaydin, head of Turkey's Higher Education Commission, is against the proposal. He said that allowing headscarves would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government.
 It is an attempt to create a counterrevolution, Akaydin said. It will be a breaking point. 
He said a majority of female high school students at one school were wearing headscarves during last weekend's entry exams -- a rarity in Turkish schools.
The Higher Education Commission will meet Friday in Ankara to discuss the proposed changes. E-mail to a friend

"Long before the women's movement of the late 1960s and 70s, lived a 19th Century woman by the name of Susan B. Anthony. Anthony was fighting for women's rights long before the social revolution 50 years ago. She was born in 1820 to a Quaker family. Quakers are a close-knit, faith-based group of people who live a very simple and strict life. It is a traditional way of life where gender roles are clearly defined.
 
She spent much of her early life fighting for social change. She was an anti-slavery abolitionist, teacher, author, and was a leading figure in gaining women the right to vote, and to hold office. The suffrage movement was designed to gain voting rights for women who previously had no voice in government. Another social cause Anthony was heavily involved with was the anti-slavery movement. Anthony made her family farm available for like-minded people to have anti-slavery meetings. She was involved in the abolitionist movement until the end of the American Civil War, when slavery was abolished. She then turned her attention to women's rights.
Anthony founded a weekly publication called ""The Revolution"", which she used to publish women's rights literature. The newspaper's motto was ""Men their rights, and nothing more; women their rights, and nothing less.""
In 1872, after touring the country trying to build momentum for women's rights, she illegally voted in the presidential election. She was arrested and fined, even though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to bring more awareness to the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good fight until her death in 1905 at the age of 84. She is honored today by the United States mint with the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin.",B2
"Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated by many people in the United States and Canada. In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.
 
Most people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together. Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year. People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal - Thanksgiving dinner.
What most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call Thanksgiving Day ""Turkey Day"". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing. Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato, apple, pecan, and pumpkin.
Thanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street.",B2
"Father's Day is a holiday observed in the United States to honor fathers, fatherhood, and other paternal figures like grandfathers, stepfathers, and uncles. It is observed on the third Sunday in June.
 
In the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed almost 400 men. A push for a day to remember the men killed, who were mostly husbands and fathers, was the start of a push for a national holiday. This was in 1908. It wasn't until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a national holiday. This is due in part to the fact that people were resistant to what they saw as another overly invented holiday meant to just make people spend money. It wasn't seen as a way to remember the dead or to honor living fathers and father figures. People weren't entirely wrong. Organizations representing men's clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for the holiday to become popular.
Like Mother's Day, it indeed is a holiday that has become highly commercialized. There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores advertise gifts for Dad. These gifts traditionally include electronics, ties, and tools. In schools, children often make cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday even though it is widely celebrated. Some of the ways Father's Day is celebrated is with meals, especially barbecues since the holiday falls at the beginning of the summer.",B2
"As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines wo n't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children.
Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy shift in late April with little fanfare.
Previously, families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies.
 We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups, said United spokesman Charles Hobart. The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
 I have to wonder if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families to board, said Brett Snyder of the blog crankyflier.com.
Kate Hanni of flyersrights.org calls the move very anti-family. 
 There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane, said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN. I hope United changes their mind. 
 If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them, Hobart said. That message has been communicated. 
 We 're not going to fly United knowing that we 're going to have to put up with that extra hassle, wrote Steven Manson, a Brooklyn, New York, father of twin 4-year-old boys. Frankly, we always look forward to the preboarding when we fly and try and position ourselves near the gate when boarding begins. It's just so helpful getting the car seat attached and everyone settled before the plane is crowded with passengers, Manson said in an e-mail to CNN.
A guerrilla approach to flying with kids
The policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between United and Continental.
 We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft, Hobart said.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding. However, the airline said it makes an announcement to all ticketed passengers before general boarding asking anyone who needs extra time or assistance to come forward.
 It would not be realistic to preboard that many families just on that sole basis alone, wrote an American Airlines spokeswoman in an e-mail to CNN. It could easily translate into most of the passengers for the flight. 
JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said. Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets. So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under 5 to board early.
US Airways tweaked its child preboarding rules within the past year -- allowing families with kids to get on the plane after the call for Zone 2, but before the general boarding announcement. Previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding. We 're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers, said spokeswoman Liz Landau.

"Miami is well known for its tropical weather, retiree community and Cuban-American population, but not so much as an international art hub. Luckily for downtown Miami, billionaire real-estate developer Jorge Perez wants to change that.
The real estate developer and art lover donated $40 million, half made up from his private art collection, to the Perez Art Museum Miami, known as PAMM, one of the few major institutions in the United States with a Hispanic name.
That's certainly one way to put Miami on the map.
Ancient village found in Miami
Downtown Miami is in the midst of a major revitalization: David Beckham is hoping to build a stadium there for his recently announced Miami soccer team. Within the art world, the international art and fashion extravaganza Art Basel, which has taken place in Miami Beach for more than a decade, is considered to be the country's leading art fair with 130 international museum and institutions attracting tens of thousands of people to the five-day event.
Jorge Perez hopes his museum will help take Miami to the next level.
 Cultural institutions have played a critical role in the growth of Miami, with this museum as a leading example, Perez said in an interview with CNN.
Before Perez was known as the Condo King of South Florida, he started as an urban planner, focusing on low-income housing developments.
Then, he co-founded a real estate development firm, The Related Group of Florida, working in high-end condo construction in the 1980s.
In 2005, TIME magazine named him one of the top 25 most influential Hispanics in the United States.
The 64-year-old billionaire also made Forbes list of 400 richest Americans several times, the only Latino immigrant to do so.
Born in Argentina to Cuban parents, Perez grew up in Colombia before migrating to Miami as a teen. His lifelong passion for Latin American art stems from his upbringing.
In his early 20s, he started collecting paintings by Roberto Matta, Diego Rivera, Wifredo Lam, and Joaquin Torres-Garcia. Now, 110 works selected by the museum from Perez's private collection are available for everyone to see inside the three-story, 200,000-square-foot museum, designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron.
Walk inside the $220 million building and you will be surrounded by tall glass windows that are said to be the largest hurricane impact resistant in the world. Hanging from every side of the museum are 70 self-watering hydroponic gardens, designed by French landscape artist Patrick Blanc.
The museum focuses on international art of the 20th and 21st centuries, and is currently showing Chinese artist-activist Ai Weiwei's According to What ? collection.
PAMM is one of the main attractions in what was known as Bicentennial Park, now Museum Park -- which will also house the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science, set to open in 2015.
The Perez Art Museum had a smooth opening last year except for one slight hiccup: naming it.
While the majority of board members voted in favor of naming the museum after Perez, four resigned in protest. It seems they had their heart set on the Miami Art Museum. 
That's because $100 million of the $167 million raised was city and county taxpayer money and the city of Miami donated the waterfront land where PAMM sits. Some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum.
 I can not speak for others. However, the great majority of the board was supportive. On a board of 47, 43 voted in favor of the renaming, Perez said.
Perez has been involved with the museum since well before the building project began and he said he is honored the board chose to recognize him in that way.
 I think most people want to be remembered with the causes they feel worthwhile and helped promote, Perez said.
It seemed odd that PAMM received its share of strife for naming it after donor when just a few years ago the Miami Science Museum's name was changed to the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science after a generous donor who gave $35 million to construct the new museum in Museum Park.
 The name change has been extremely well received by the community. Patricia and Phillip Frost are very well-liked people and they symbolize what we 're about, said Gillian Thomas, president and CEO of Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science.
When it comes to naming rights, perhaps Miami takes its art more seriously than science.
 People have opinions about art, whereas science is a bit more concrete, so there would n't be backlash for naming a building after a donor, Thomas said.
But, she points out, naming Miami's art museum after Perez carries a sense of pride for the Hispanic community, even though his art donation does n't represent a collection. 
 Jorge Perez is the first major donor from the Hispanic community, Thomas said.
Other American art museums have been named after donors, like The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and have n't stirred any controversy.
 While people may not agree on a name, Thomas said, everyone can see that downtown Miami is quickly becoming a hub for science and art, which means donations are needed. 
So far that does n't seem to be a problem for the Perez Art Museum; it has reached the 90 % mark in its $220 million capital campaign.

"Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western portion of the United States. The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife.
In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shopping, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention.
A stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a visit to many popular cities worldwide. Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important international sites and monuments. These famous landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, Venice, and even ancient Rome.
One day, John took a side trip outside of the city to visit the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World. The canyon offers a breathtaking view of Nevada's ridges and natural landscape. John especially liked the canyon because it was removed from all of the noise and movement in downtown Las Vegas.
John had a great time during his trip to Las Vegas. He did not win a lot of money in the casinos. However, he managed to see a lot of amazing sites during his visit to this city that never sleeps.",B2

"If we look around us at the things we have purchased at some point in our lives, we would no doubt notice that not everything we own is being put to good use: the thick woollen coat which we thought looked trendy despite the fact that we live in a tropical country, the smartphone that got put away when we bought ourselves the newest model, the car that only gets used at the weekends, or even the guest room in our house that somehow got turned into a storeroom.
Those underutilised items may seem useless to some, but could be an asset to others. With the advent of the internet, online communities have figured out a way to generate profit from the sharing of those underused assets. Using websites and social media groups that facilitate the buying and selling of second-hand goods, it is now easier than ever for peer-to-peer sharing activities to take place. And this is known as the sharing economy.
These democratised online platforms are providing a chance for people to make a quick buck or two. To give an example, busy parents previously might not have bothered with setting up a stall at the local market or car boot sale to sell their children's old equipment, but with online marketplaces, parents are now able to sell on those hardly worn baby clothes that their children have outgrown and the expensive pushchairs and baby equipment they have invested in, so as to put some cash back into their pockets.
Businesses have also caught on to the profitability of the sharing economy and are seeking to gain from making use of those underutilised resources. A business model that has rapidly risen in popularity sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service. Companies like Airbnb act as a middleman for people to cash in on their unused rooms and houses and let them out as lucrative accommodation. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time.
This move towards a sharing economy is not without criticisms. Unlike businesses, unregulated individuals do not have to follow certain regulations and this can lead to poorer and inconsistent quality of goods and services and a higher risk of fraud. Nevertheless, in the consumerist society we live in today, the increased opportunities to sell on our unwanted and underused goods can lead to a lesser impact on our environment.",B2
"Rosa Parks is a prime example of how an ordinary American can change the world around her. She was born in 1913, in the southern state of Alabama. Parks became famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as ""Colored Only.""
 
On December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil disobedience. She later said she had grown ""tired of giving in.""
Her arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.
Parks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the ""First Lady of Civil Rights,"" by the United States Congress, and ""The Mother of the Freedom Movement."" She has been honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both before and after her death.",B2
"Samuel Langhorne Clemens, best known as Mark Twain, is an American author and humorist. He wrote two of the most significant novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which provided the settings for his novels.
 
Clemens held a variety of odd jobs as a young man. He was a journalist, miner, printer's apprentice, and typesetter, but journalism was what he liked doing best. His writing style earned him praise from critics worldwide. William Faulkner, another great American author, called him ""The Father of American Literature.""
Twain was already a very successful writer when he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The main character Tom Sawyer was based on his own experiences as a child. His best friends were also based on real-life friends Twain grew up with. Huckleberry Finn, the main character of his finest work, was also based on a childhood friend.
Twain was a prolific writer who penned several books, and other publications. Most of his writing was taken from his life in the western part of the United States while traveling with his brother Orion. He was born Christian, but later in life questioned his faith, and developed negative feelings toward organized religion. He was once quoted as saying, ""If Christ were here, now there is one thing he would not be - Christian."" Twain died in 1910 from a heart attack at the age of 74.

"These days many people attend community colleges with plans to transfer to a four-year college or university to get a bachelor's degree. It's kind of like a stepping-stone. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community college doesn't have that agreement of a guaranteed spot in a four-year college, it has articulation agreements with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student in a community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements make sure that students don't waste time taking classes that won't transfer. Most of these classes one needs to take before transferring are general education classes, like math and English.
 
Another reason why many students start their undergraduate degree at a community college is a financial one. A four-year college or university is much more expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students, who don't qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Also community colleges tend to offer more evening classes so they can accommodate people who have to work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community colleges also tend to be commuter schools, meaning people don't have to live on campus in dorms. Attending a community college means you can still live at home with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.
If a student didn't do well in high school, a community college would provide him or her with another opportunity to enter a four-year university. Community colleges offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you attend a four-year college, you are expected to have those skills already. Community college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school.",B2
"In the United States, 43 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, all have their own lottery. A lottery is used for states to raise money. Licensed stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own numbers. When you let a machine pick your numbers, it is usually called a Quick Pick. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birthdates or other important numbers to them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets goes to pay for schools, roads, bridges, and other public services. Once a week or more, a drawing is held where the numbers are randomly picked. If your ticket has those numbers, you could win a cash prize.
 
There are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto. Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant lottery tickets that are scratch-off cards. The winnings tend to be less money, but they are extremely popular.
In the United States, you can play the lottery, or buy a ticket if you are 18 years or older. If you win, usually you have the option of being paid the entire amount in one lump sum or of being paid smaller amounts over a number of years. Lottery winnings are taxable, meaning the amount you actually get is smaller than the jackpot number. People can buy lottery tickets or play the lottery at many convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular since they advertise. There are many television commercials, radio commercials, and billboards urging people to play.
Lotteries have been controversial since they are essentially a form of legalized gambling. There is concern that it can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling. There are also illegal lottery games, usually run by some forms of organized crime.",B2

"Two days after a Philadelphia woman's abduction was captured on video, police say they have a lead across the state line: Someone used her bank card Tuesday morning in Maryland.
A male used Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at 6:01 a.m. a bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, about a 75-mile drive southwest from the Philadelphia street where she was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters.
Wilson did n't say how the card was used or whether cash was withdrawn. But he said surveillance video showed a male similar to the man who police say dragged and abducted the 22-year-old woman Sunday night.
News of that lead came shortly before Freeland-Gaither's family publicly pleaded with whoever took her.
 Please return her. We just want Carlesha returned to us safely, her grandmother Ana Mulero said at a news conference with Wilson in Philadelphia. Just return her to us. We 're her family. She has a family here. We need her. 
Police did n't immediately release the bank video. But authorities earlier released a video that they say shows Freeland-Gaither being accosted by an unknown man in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area around 9:40 p.m. on Sunday.
That video, released Monday, shows a man approaching a woman near an intersection and then grabbing her and dragging her down a street, toward the camera.
The released footage does n't include audio, but a witness reported that Freeland-Gaither yelled for help, police said.
The video shows Freeland-Gaither tussling on the ground with her abductor and being forced into a four-door vehicle, which police say may be a gray Ford Taurus.
Her glasses and cell phone were dropped onto the road during the struggle. Just before the vehicle pulled away, Freeland-Gaither broke out one of the passenger side windows, police said.
Police described the abductor as an unknown black man of medium-heavy build, 25 to 30 years old. The video shows him wearing a dark jacket with a hood, a dark hat and dark pants.
Freeland-Gaither's family told CNN affiliate WPVI that she worked as a nurse and was just blocks from her home when she was abducted.
Investigators are n't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said. Police have n't publicly talked about a possible motive.
Authorities initially said the abductor's car had a Pennsylvania license plate, but Wilson said Tuesday that investigators are looking into whether a Maryland plate was on the car's front. The plate is n't readily legible in the video, and police said no witness gave them a plate number.
Mulero said her granddaughter lived with her for four years in Maryland before Freeland-Gaither returned to Philadelphia to be with other relatives and pursue a career.
Officials are offering rewards of $42,000 for information leading to the case's resolution, including $25,000 from the FBI, which is assisting in the investigation, Wilson said.

"Pop-country singer Patti Page died on January 1st in Encinitas, California. She was 85.
Born Clara Ann Fowler, Page was the best-selling female artist of the 1950s and had 19 gold and 14 platinum singles. Page landed on the charts 111 times, and her blend of genres made her a traditional-pop icon. She scored her first million-selling track in 1950 with With My Eyes Wide Open, I 'm Dreaming, and sang hits like -LRB- How Much Is That -RRB- Doggie in the Window and Old Cape Cod. Her signature track, Tennessee Waltz, later became an official state song of Tennessee, and her popularity led to her own TV shows on CBS, NBC and ABC in the Fifties and film roles in the Sixties.
Ravi Shankar, Temptations to get Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards
Page received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Country Walk of Fame. She also won a Grammy in 1999 for her first live album, Live at Carnegie Hall: The 50th Anniversary Concert, and continued to tour until her death. The White Stripes covered her 1948 track Conquest on their 2007 album Icky Thump.
Before her death, Page was announced as one of this year's recipients of the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Awards at this year's Grammy ceremony. She is survived by her two children, Daniel O'Curran and Kathleen Ginn, and sister Peggy Layton. Memorial services have not yet been made.

"Madonna Louise Ciccone is a popular singer, songwriter, and actress in the United States. Madonna, as she is commonly known, burst onto the music scene in the early 1980s with a style that had never been seen before. Her sexy, and scantily clad costumes and performances both delighted and aggravated the American public for years. She excelled at pushing the boundaries of what most Americans perceived as acceptable in her music videos and live performances. Madonna did not shy away from controversial subjects, either.
 
Madonna was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1958. She moved to New York City to pursue a career in dancing as a young woman. She began her music career with a couple of club bands in New York, but was soon noticed by music industry executives. In 1983, she released her first album titled simply, ""Madonna."" This was just the beginning for the superstar. She followed her initial success with several hit albums and singles such as Like a Virgin, and Into the Groove. She coupled her commercial success in music with successful performances in a series of movies such as Desperately Seeking Susan, and Evita. It seemed there was nothing Madonna could not do.
One of Madonna's defining characteristics is her ability to reinvent herself. Many artists find success in the very competitive, entertainment industry, but most are only successful for a short period of time, but not Madonna. She has sold more than 300 million records worldwide to date. She ranked second only to the Beatles on Billboard's list of Greatest Acts of the 20th Century.
Madonna's career has not been without controversy, though. She has been the subject of several lawsuits for her acts, but she survived, and thrived through it all. She is still one of the best female artists in the United States today.",B2
"Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail raked up by the car on its way up to the Big House. The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter didn't come out here unless he had to, which was just fine by Sam. The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job.
Carter came by later while Sam was chopping wood. Carter lifted his hat as if he were waiting for an appointment with the town priest, and then removed it completely as if he were talking to his mother. He pulled out a pile of paper from his back pocket and held it out.
'Don't pick up your mail often, do you?'
Sam took it without a glance and dropped the envelopes onto the bench.
'Never,' he replied and waited for Carter to say why he was here. The fact it was Carter's house was no explanation and they both knew it. Carter twisted his hat round and round, licking his lips and clearing his throat.
'Nice work fixing those fences,' he said finally.
'I'll be back to the beginning soon,' Sam said. It wasn't a complaint. A fence that took a year to repair meant another year's work to the man who did it well.
'Don't you ever want to take a holiday?'
'And go where?' A holiday meant being back out in the real world, a place even people like Carter travelled to escape from. Sam's escape was his reality and he wasn't going back.
Mr Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.
'I've brought my son with me on this trip. He's had some trouble at school.' Mr Carter's eyes flicked up, blinked rapidly and then shifted back to the hat occupying his hands. 'Not much trouble out here for a young boy.' He attempted a laugh but it came out like a dog's bark.
The two men looked towards the northern end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they stood. However bored and rebellious a teenage boy might get, it wasn't possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest of the horses, kicking at the ground with its heavy hooves. Could the boy ride? he wondered. There was a whole load of trouble a good rider could get into out here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father.",B2
"From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people flock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams). They come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted - the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream. 
Here, at the central African country's first ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple flavours. Toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. Black tea and coffee are also on sale. 
The shop, which has ""ice cream, coffee, dreams"" across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert - and ""changing lives"" in the process, says Inzozi Nziza's manager, Louise Ingabire. 
""Ice cream is important,"" she says between mouthfuls of a honey-flavoured offering. ""Some Rwandans like ice cream, but it's a new thing. We still have some work to do, to tell others that they'll enjoy it."" 
True to Inzozi Nziza's motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. ""I didn't have a job before: I just stayed at home. Now, I have a vision for the future. I am making money and I can give some of it to my family,"" says the 27-year-old. 
Butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, Kigali, is the home of the National University of Rwanda. Inzozi Nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different. 
""It's something uniting people here,"" Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. ""If you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream."" 
Most of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby Nyanza. The vanilla beans and cocoa are imported. 
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese. She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas, co-founders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn, New York, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010. 
""An ice-cream shop, Katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,"" Miesen says. 
At the start, Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-profit. They did not set financial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials. 
The shop's success is no exception, says Fatuma Ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the Rwanda Governance Board. ""Small businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. Women are newcomers to big business,"" she points out. ""We have more women entrepreneurs. It's an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside Kigali."" 
Though ice cream is somewhat new to Rwanda, Ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. ""I think it's great. It requires a lot of skills and changing people's mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. I think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting."" 
The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, Rwanda's first and only female drumming troupe, which was established by Katese ten years ago. 
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. 
Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows, some orphans. Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways. 
Historically, says Ingabire, Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. ""But it's something which brings unity."" 
Ingabire's father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. ""Some of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,"" she says. ""When I'm drumming with them, it gives me power because we're still alive and survivors."" 
The popular eatery features in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman, sibling film-makers. Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers. 
The film, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the US, UK and several African states, premieres in Rwanda in 2014. ""We feel the film is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,"" says Lisa Fruchtman, who won an Academy Award for film- editing in 1984.

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- The family of James McNair, the late comedian known as Jimmy Mack, has settled a lawsuit with Walmart over the auto accident that killed him and injured fellow comedian Tracy Morgan, McNair's family says.
McNair's sister, Pamela McNair, said the amount agreed upon is confidential, but was satisfactory to all parties.
 There is no value, no dollar amount, on my brother's life at all, she said. But in terms of finances, it will assist the family a great deal to continue living life. 
McNair was the father to 26-year-old Jamel and 19-year-old Danita and was the oldest of seven siblings he cared for greatly, Pamela said.
 There's nothing we can do to change what happened, Walmart said. Walmart and the McNair family have worked closely together to reach an agreement. Walmart continues to work with others involved in the accident and we will continue to do what's right. 
Last June, a limo bus carrying Morgan, McNair and their companions was rear-ended by a Walmart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. The crash killed McNair and left Morgan with a severe brain injury and their colleagues with other injuries.
A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board said the Walmart truck was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit, and that its driver was almost at his drive-time limit.
In July, four parties filed suit against Walmart, stating in a complaint that the defendantsnegligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing plaintiffsinjuries. 
Pamela McNair said the family will continue carrying on Jameslegacy as a humanitarian, and the finances from the settlement will help.
 My brother has done a lot for the community. He mentored the youth for the community, he worked at the homeless shelter. Little things that he's done are truly missed, McNair said.
 He was a great comedian, but he was a good family person first and foremost. He loved life and wanted others to love life as well. He was a humanitarian. 
The mayor of McNair's hometown, Peekskill, New York, has named June 12 in his honor, she said.
Tracy Morgan's lawyer told CNN in November that he was still recovering from the car accident that left him with a severe brain injury and is fighting to return to the person he once was.
McNair said her family has not been in contact with the Morgan family.
 It's kind of heartbreaking, McNair said. I understand he has his own medical situation, I want the best for him, I 'm praying for his recovery, but I felt that someone could have reached out to the family.... My brother and Tracy had a very long relationship as friends and it is heartbreaking we have n't heard from anyone.

"Affectionately known in his home city of Madrid as the wise man of Hortaleza, Luis Aragones left the legacy of helping Spain's ascension to the top of world football.
Aragones, whose death at the age of 75 was announced Saturday, coached his national side to the European Championship title in 2008 -- the country's first success at a major tournament in more than 40 years.
That breakthrough was continued by his successor Vicente del Bosque, who continued with the tiki taka passing style Aragones introduced, as La Roja won the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European crown.
 Without a doubt, he marked the road in this final successful phase. I felt a great deal of appreciation towards him, Del Bosque told the national team's official website.
 I knew he had some health problems, but I never imagined it would lead to this. 
 Always with us, Luis, led the website tribute of Atletico Madrid, the club where Aragones played for a decade between 1964-74 and was head coach on four occasions, most recently 2001-03.
He guided Atletico to the La Liga title in 1977 and the Spanish Cup on three occasions.
 Luis Aragones was a great player and coach, but before all that a great person and a friend, said the team's president Enrique Cerezo.
 First and foremost he was Atletico. We want to express on behalf of the whole club our condolences to his family. 
Aragonesfinal coaching job was with Turkish side Fenerbahce, which ended in mid-2009, and late last year he announced his retirement from the game -- in which he started out at Getafe in 1957.
He was reportedly taken to a Madrid hospital last week with a serious illness, from which he did not recover.
Aragones will be buried at a private ceremony on Sunday. Atletico will observe a minute's silence ahead of the home match against Real Sociedad, in which the team will seek to go top of the table above another of his former teams, Barcelona.
 I wish to express our sorrow at the loss of one of football's greatest men and one of the most charismatic and likeable managers we remember, Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu said before his side's 3-2 defeat by Valencia -- its first at home in the league since April 2012.
 As a club, we had the honor of his services, albeit for a very short time, in the 1987-88 season, when we won the Spanish Cup.
 We much appreciate his respect for Barca, its model and our players. Euro 2008, with Puyol, Xavi, Iniesta and so many others, is a great example. 
Aragonesappreciation of Barca's tiki taka style -- started by Johann Cruyff and developed by Pep Guardiola -- was borne out by the number of the players from the Catalan club he selected for the national team.
But his heart lay in the nation's capital, where he was on the books of Atletico's big rival Real Madrid from 1958-60 as a player -- though he spent most of that time out on loan to other clubs.
 The loss of Luis Aragones saddens all of us who love football, said Real president Florentino Perez.
 Today is a day of mourning for this sport, but it should also be a day of recognition for a legendary figure who was vital in giving us a glorious period with our Spanish national team.
 He ennobled this sport and all Spanish fans owe him gratitude and respect. His personal and professional career was always characterized by honesty and hard work. 
The only blot on his international career was an incident in 2004, when he was accused of making a racial comment -- which was caught on television cameras -- about France striker Thierry Henry while he was trying to motivate his players in training ahead of a World Cup qualifying match.
Aragones was fined by European football's ruling body UEFA and subsequently apologized to Henry, insisting he had not intended to make a racial insult.

"Five years ago, telling a friend that you interact regularly with a verbose orange traffic cone might earn you a pitying hug and a quick trip to the sanatorium.
But these days, your friend might respond that they trade barbs with Rick Santorum's sweater vest.
Welcome to the age of novelty Twitter accounts, where animals, inanimate objects and other nonhuman entities speak their mind regularly: A pigeon with a foul mouth and a fouler demeanor. San Francisco's famous fog. Even the universe. On the social-media platform, users can express themselves creatively and get laughs by giving voice to those things that ca n't speak for themselves.
Novelty nonhuman accounts have been a Twitter staple since Sockington, a Boston-area housecat, joined the service in March 2007 on his way to 1.4 million followers. But they 've been in the news again recently after one user created @olympicseat, a tongue-in-cheek response to the curiously vacant seats at Olympic venues in London. In the span of a few days, it has amassed more than 21,000 followers.
Another Olympics-related feed celebrates the star-spangled towel that American gymnast Danell Leyva drapes over himself between events. It has more than 12,000 followers -- not bad, considering the average Twitter user has 126.
Most of the people in this group of noteworthy Twitterers say their primary motivation for tweeting is to have fun. For others, it's a chance to make their mark in the crowded world of the Web.
However, all agree that more thought goes into their 140-character musings than meets the eye.
Cat Food Breath
When the woman behind pet-centric account @CatFoodBreath began her novelty Twitter account in August 2010, she was n't planning on sticking around.
 I figured the best way to test the waters was with a pseudonym, said the Burlington, Vermont, resident who asked that her name not be published to preserve the anonymity of her Twitter persona. I would n't offend friends and colleagues if I did n't follow them, and I could make a polite exit from Twitter when I was done poking around. 
Two years and almost 19,000 followers later, she is still at it. In the beginning, though, she and many other novelty account successes admit they did n't really know what it was.
 At first, I did n't know this account was about a cat, -LSB- but -RSB- as I explored the Twitterverse, I soon realized I had a character that people related to, she said.
Real or not, Cat Food Breath is definitely a character. The cat -LRB- its gender is ambiguous -RRB- writes odes to the couch, gives its owner commands with Garfield-like acerbity and complains about the family dog -- lovingly called Labradum. 
The San Francisco Fog
Other anonymous Twitter celebs began their accounts to educate and bring -LRB- hilarious -RRB- awareness to unappreciated things that ca n't speak for themselves, like the San Francisco fog that brings a chill to summers in that city.
 I love everything about the fog, said the man who created @KarlTheFog in August 2010. I think the way it sneaks over the hills is beautiful, mysterious and even a little romantic. I love how it stops at certain points above the city, creating a wall of clouds. And having moved here from a city where it was 100-plus degrees in the summer, I was mostly excited to not be dripping in sweat for three consecutive months. 
The man, who also requested anonymity, was inspired by @BPGlobalPR, a popular parody response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Through the lens of Karl the Fog, he reports on the public's feelings toward the fog and acts like a PR rep for the maligned form of weather -- with a witty bent. Karl already has more than 5,000 followers.
Giving Karl an identity has brought out emphatic and sometimes cursory responses -- especially when the fog blocked Fourth of July fireworks -- but the Twitterverse has been receptive overall, he said.
 -LSB- I get -RSB- lots of weather puns and haikus. My favorite tweets are when people take pictures of Karl and post them on Twitter or Instagram, the man said. Seeing so many people pick up on it and tag Karl in their pictures has been overwhelmingly cool. 
The Orange Cone
Like Karl the Fog, @TheOrangeCone loves it when followers interact with him online.
The Orange Cone was originally a MySpace account but came to Twitter after its creator discovered the witty tweets of Bronx Zoo's Cobra, last year's famously escaped snake, and motorsports satirist @nascarcasm. Today the Orange Cone keeps a following of more than 20,000 users up to date on NASCAR happenings.
And his followers respond in droves.
 People notice cones in their everyday life and send pictures to me by the hundreds, said the man behind the Cone, who asked that his name not be used. I find that hilarious -- people stopping what they are doing in the real world to take a picture of an orange cone. I love it. 
He added, Whenever the cone is hit during the course of a NASCAR race, my feed blows up. 
When driver Kasey Kahne hit the cone during a February practice in Daytona, the Twitterverse came to Orange Cone's aid.
 Kasey made a Twitter apology and I added about 1,200 followers in the next hour, he said. It was insane. 
Staying in character
For some, the prospect of interacting for real with followers is off the table.
 I am a bit like Banksy. Nobody knows who I am, said the man behind the foul-tempered @PigeonJon bird character, referring to the anonymous Britain-based artist. If possible, I 'd like to keep it this way ? he wrote in an e-mail to CNN.
Apart from that statement, Jon never broke character. Instead, he offered clues to his personality.
 I like Biscuits. I do not like Velcro, he wrote.
The person behind the wildly popular @BronxZoosCobra, which chronicles the exploits of a real-life snake that briefly escaped its enclosure at the New York City zoo, also declined to break character in an e-mail exchange with CNN. The account has more than 200,000 followers.
The strangest thing tweeted at the snake, its creator said, was a request for an endorsement from a high school student running for student government. I endorsed him, she wrote CNN. He lost. Snake bigotry at its best. 
Online alter egos
Many novelty Twitterers with large followings are baffled by their popularity, which has led them to think about the relationship between the Internet and the real world.
 I have a feeling, and I could be wrong, that the people that follow The Orange Cone find it to be more realthan some of the drivers out on the track, its creator said. They can reach out and in most cases get a response. And the fact that no one knows who it is -- which means it could be anyone -- just adds to the mystery and the enjoyment. 
Added the man behind KarlTheFog, I think people in the Bay Area like Karl because the fog was already a character in their lives. In a world that's becoming increasingly personalized, you can surround yourself with a cast of friends on the Internet that match your exact interests and sense of humor. 
Being Karl has challenged him to think about sports, pop culture, and politics in ridiculous ways, he said.
 It forces me to be disciplined by sticking to a theme. Since my job is n't creative by nature, it gives me the chance to be as witty as I want. 
Other Twitter users say that embodying nonhuman entities gives them the chance to create alter egos. The Cone gets to say and do the things I think we all wish we could do, its creator said.
The man behind @WeirdHorse, a decidedly oddball stream of musings about, well, horse life, thinks he knows why his 137,000 followers appreciate his quirky humor.
 It's a breath of fresh air because it's not malicious, he said. It's not forced out by a brand with an agenda or political motive and it's whimsical, throw-away and easy to digest. People respond well to that sort of thing. 
Whimsical, yes. But let's be honest: @WeirdHorse may have one little agenda.
 The recent demand for Weird Horse T-shirts and mugs from my site... has been another perk, he said.

"There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rio's Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was having none of the doom and gloom that preceded some of the build-up to the tournament in Brazil. ""The place is lovely. The people are great. There's a party atmosphere,"" said McDowell. ""The only thing that could be better is the England team.""
He and half a dozen friends are among the multitudes of supporters from around the world who have made the beachfront into a party zone of national colours and chants. Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen. The last time there were so many people here during the daytime, the pope was visiting.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was far from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems that plagued preparations for the World Cup. But, now the football is well and truly under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience. ""If I had known, when I started planning, how complicated and costly it would be, I wouldn't have come. But, now that we're here, it's great,"" said Brian Hill, a retired chief executive from Sunderland.
The trip has not been problem free. Hill travelled for more than 20 hours to get to Rio, then hit long delays on the road from the airport at 6.30am. His son, Andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach. And, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games. But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Even the surliest cynic cannot have failed to be thrilled by Robin van Persie's extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain. Elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the first eight games - almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010. Adding to the carnival mood on the streets, where the majority of fans are from neighbouring nations, Latin-American teams won in every game they played up until the time of writing.
So far, the tournament has avoided the worst Doomsday scenarios, though it is far from trouble free. The stadiums may have been delivered late and - in some cases - not fully finished, but there have been no reports of structural problems or difficulties entering the grounds since the kick off.
As at previous World Cups, ticketing has been a problem, with many empty seats at several games, including the Netherlands against Spain. FIFA spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi confirmed that only 48,000 of the 51,900 seats at the ground were filled. FIFA is also investigating security lapses that allowed Chilean fans to let off fireworks during their victory over Australia.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities. Almost all suffered worse traffic congestion than usual. The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June. In Salvador, some journey times were five times longer than usual. ""Traffic was already bad but this week it is chaotic,"" Jecilda Mello, president of residents' group the Association of Friends of the Historic Centre, told the paper.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray. Since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans. A spontaneous street party of Argentinian fans was dispersed with pepper spray after the fans blocked roads.
The huge distances have led to some sharply contrasting World Cup experiences. The tournament has made only a small mark on Sao Paulo, South America's most populous city, but, far away in Manaus - the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy - visitors said World Cup fever was in full swing with brightly decorated streets and flags fluttering on many cars.
The FA chairman, Greg Dyke, said the shift in mood was palpable. ""We've had a really warm welcome in Manaus. It's a big thing for them, even if it is a bit strange to spend so much on a stadium with no one to play in it. But we were in Sao Paulo for four or five days in the run-up to the opening match and you wouldn't have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on. It was weird.""",B2
"The British tourist who caught a 1-year-old child who fell from the fourth-floor balcony of an Orlando, Florida, hotel was honored by government and business leaders Friday.
Officials credit Helen Beard's quick thinking with saving Jah-Nea Myleslife. Beard was in the pool area of the Econo Lodge Inn and Suites around 9:15 Thursday evening when, after hearing horrific screams, she looked up to see a small child hanging from a hotel balcony.
 We heard shouts and I turned around, said Beard, 44, a mother who was on vacation with her partner, Philip Charlesworth, and her 10-year-old son, Ben. I was able to run over and catch Jah-Nea, she said.
Beard said it appeared the girl slipped through a railing along the balcony walkway, deputies told CNN affiliate WKMG.
See hotel and how far child fell
Just hours later, Beard, a health services analyst, was honored for her heroic actions. She was given a Medal of Merit by the Orange County Sheriff's Department, the International Drive Chamber of Commerce and the state Department of Children and Families for showing unusual instinct and initiative when she leaped into action.
 It all happened so fast, said Beard, who was still shocked by all the attention. I just sat with her and tried to calm her down while everyone was panicking around me. 
Helena Myles, the child's mother, said she left her daughter with a friend in a motel room, according to WKMG. The friend, Dominique Holt, said he went to use the bathroom and then found the hotel room door open after hearing screams, the sheriff's office said.
A woman who was in the hotel room with Holt said she did n't know the child was there, according to deputies.
No charges have been filed in the case.

"Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing.
An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International had reached the disaster zone, but the area's remoteness prevented further contact with headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.
SurfAid had shipped 1,000 shelter kits to victims, and is preparing to send more supplies once communication is established, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said Thursday.
The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, she said.
The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands.
 It's very difficult to reach the region either by boat or road, said Andrew Judge, CEO of SurfAid.
The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies.
The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags.
Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia.
An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said.
 The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there, said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.
The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures.
Monday's quake generated a significant tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament.
Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters -LRB- nearly 20 feet -RRB- high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters -LRB- almost 10 feet -RRB- high.
At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said.
The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers -LRB- 12.8 miles -RRB-, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised upward from a preliminary magnitude of 7.5.
 On Mentawai, a -LSB- tsunami -RSB- warning was issued seven minutes after detection of earthquake, which is what the existing system is capable of doing. Preliminary report indicates the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes.... For Mentawai villagers, the warning is late, as they are very close to the tsunami source, said Sanny Jegillos of the U.N. Development Programme. He oversees the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, including Indonesia.
Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said.
The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis.
On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there.

"Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them.
Khaled AlKhamissi's novel Taxi, first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages. It features 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from his own experience. A new post-revolution English edition has just been published.
Despite the optimism that swept Egypt after president Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February, AlKhamissi said taxi drivers, and the rest of the country's poor, have in fact suffered more since then.
 My taxi drivers are among the 55 % of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day, said AlKhamissi. Those 55 % were not on the streets during the revolution and are without a real voice now.
 They are wise, they are watching, they are analyzing, but they are not acting. 
He added: Life has changed for them in the wrong direction. It's worse for them because we have no security and living on the streets without security is dangerous.
 There is less tourism and more chaos on the streets. 
AlKhamissi said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution.
 We are in the middle of a battle, and during the battle we ca n't see whether life is improving or not, he said.
AlKhamissi, whose second novel Noah's Ark -- also a bestseller -- was published in 2009, said he stopped writing his third novel at the start of the uprising on January 25 this year and has been unable to concentrate on writing since.
 It's impossible to write because my mind is taken with what is happening day after day, hour after hour, he said.
Since January, AlKhamissi has filled his time with a weekly newspaper column, lectures and speaking events. But the author wants to get back to writing fiction.
 Every night I want to write because it is my only job, my only happiness, he said. I have to find a solution soon or I will die. 
 Taxi was credited with single-handedly reviving an interest in reading in Egypt, according to its publisher Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation, but AlKhamissi denies his book is responsible.
He said: Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits.
 Reading has increased in the last six years, but it has taken many social factors. We have had a cultural revolution in the last six years in all matters: Theater, music, fiction and publishing.
 This cultural revolution is related to youth searching for a dream. 
AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his -- or any other -- book.
 They do n't have time to read because they are struggling to survive, he said. When we can increase the quality of education and decrease poverty, then they will be able to read. I 'm not interested in whether they read my book, I just hope they will read anything. 
Another novelist credited with changing reading habits in Egypt is Ahmed Khaled Towfik, a 49-year-old medical professor described by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation as the Arab world's most prominent bestselling author of fantasy and horror. He has written more than 200 books, selling millions of copies.
He said he was among the first Egyptian authors to write for young people.
 Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read, said Towfik. We invented popular literature. I think I made the youth fond of reading.
 I think most of my readers were in Tahrir Square. I changed a part of their thinking, although you ca n't compare that to their economic disappointment or the scourge of the police system. 
Towfik's book Utopia, which has just been published in English, is a grim futuristic account of Egyptian society in the year 2023 with wealthy gated communities insulated from the poverty outside.
Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true.
 The first uprising came from the middle class, but I think another bloodier one could come from the lower classes, like described in my book Utopia.
 I still think there's a danger my book could come true. 
He added: After nine months, nothing has been accomplished except getting rid of Mubarak. We got rid of the head of the snake, but the body of the snake is still ruling everything.

"After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago.
Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing.
Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29.
Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, Yes. 
Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal.
 We do n't believe justice was done, Weinberg said.
Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long pattern of violence involving firearms. Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict 
 This was not an isolated incident, Fidler said, noting Spector's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. The taking of an innocent human life, it does n't get any more serious than that. 
Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna.
Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003.
A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction.
In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector a very dangerous man who has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth. 
Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out.
Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said.
A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict.
 This entire jury took this so seriously, she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that it's tough to be in a jury, because another person's life is in the jury's hands.
Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie Barbarian Queen and appeared in many other films, including DeathStalker,  Blind Date,  Scarface,  Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the spoof Amazon Women on the Moon. She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death.
In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a.38 - caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home.
But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, I think I killed somebody. 
Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector.
Spector's professional trademark was the Wall of Sound, the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict ?
The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called little symphonies for the kids -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes Be My Baby and the Righteous Brothers You 've Lost That LovinFeelin. 
Spector co-produced the Beatlesfinal album, Let It Be, and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year.
Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.

"Having your kid physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a style of parenting that keeps small children as physically attached as possible. This is called attachment parenting.
 
The idea behind attachment parenting is that if a small baby feels protected and safe by physical contact with their parent, especially their mother, that child will grow up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to their babies is by using a sling or a wrap to carry the baby around instead of putting the baby in a carriage. This is often called ""wearing"" your baby. Parents are also encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead parents are told to bring the baby into the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the baby about sleep regulation as well since the baby will learn to mimic adult sleep patterns. This co-sleeping is controversial though. There are concerns that babies sleeping with adults could suffocate, accidentally get crushed, or fall off the bed. There is also concern about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, where babies just suddenly stop breathing.
Another marker of attachment parenting is not worrying about spoiling a baby. Many times parents feel that paying attention to a baby's every cry makes them too needy or spoiled. Attachment parenting feels that every baby's cry should be responded to and that the baby should never be left to ""cry it out."" Instead, the baby should be comforted and crying should be taken as a signal that the baby needs something. Most attachment parents also breastfeed on demand, feeling that not only is this physically healthier, but also promotes a bond between mother and child.",B2
"Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
In an interview with a magazine in his family's native Brazil, Saverin -- a newly minted billionaire after Facebook's public stock offering -- talked about his taxes, his relationship with co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and life after The Social Network. 
Many observers believe Saverin, who, according to the Facebook origin story was slighted by Zuckerberg as the site grew, was a primary source for the book The Accidental Billionaires, on which Social Network is based.
Surprise: The Internet hates rich people
But the end result was fantasy, he said. And, no, he never angrily threw a laptop at Zuckerberg as his Hollywood counterpart, Andrew Garfield, did in the film. It's a statement Fabio Altman, of magazine Veja, writes is instantly believable given Saverin's reserved nature.
 That's Hollywood, not a documentary, the 30-year-old Saverin says in the interview conducted in his multimillion-dollar residence in Singapore.
Saverin filed a lawsuit against Facebook over his reduced stake in the company, and the legal dispute was settled out of court. But despite well-documented friction over the years, Saverin says he bears no ill will toward Zuckerberg.
 I can only speak well of Mark; I do n't resent him, Saverin said. His focus from Day One until today is admirable. He was a visionary and always knew Facebook would only grow if it remained true to its central idea of people presenting themselves truthfully and without pseudonyms.
 That is the great power of Facebook that allowed it to transform into an instrument of protest, as in Egypt, but also as an instrument of business and, beyond that, a natural way to have contact with friends. 
Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years. But he re-entered the public consciousness recently when, days before Facebook stock was due to hit Wall Street, he renounced his U.S. citizenship in favor of Singapore, where he has lived since 2009.
Many saw it as a dodge -- a way to avoid paying U.S. taxes on his share of the company, valued somewhere around $2 billion. He says that's not the case and noted that, as has been reported, he's paying his taxes.
 The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore, he said. I am obligated and I will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the American government. I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S. citizen. 
Saverin's father, Roberto, echoed those thoughts in the article.
 It was hard for me, because of the life I built in the U.S., hearing from Eduardo that he had to give up on his citizenship, he said. But he did this not because he wanted to, but because he had no other choice as a foreigner living in Singapore, where financial transactions are more restricted and bureaucratic for those who hold a U.S. passport. There was no other way. 
Roberto and his family emigrated to the United States from Brazil amid political turmoil, and Saverin's registered place of birth is Miami.

"He's won six medals in the Winter Olympics, including a gold in 2008, and a bronze just a few months ago in Sochi. Bode Miller's methods, however, have never been orthodox.
 I never really worked very goal-oriented, he admits. I think I 've had some great results and I 've had a long career, so, I mean, I 'm happy about that. But I did n't really ever have goals, the way that most people did. 
Miller has always intrigued media and fans alike. An unconventional upbringing in a New Hampshire log cabin with no electricity or running water gave way to a skiing career in which, for Miller, his natural talent and love of the sport always won out over, well, winning.
Indeed, his goal, as stated in his book Bode: Go fast, Be Good, Have Fun was to ski as fast as the natural universe would allow. 
Back home after an emotional Olympics in Sochi, where Miller cried during a live interview with NBC's Christin Cooper when asked about the recent death of his brother, Miller is focusing on another project: his Turtle Ridge Foundation.
Miller began the foundation after close friend Cameron Shaw-Doran suffered a traumatic injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down.
 I was trying to help him get re-involved in sports. He was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting, which is a really tough process when you 're injured like that, says Miller. Just to watch him go through that I saw how hard it was and how little support there was for him. 
The experience motivated Miller to find ways to help get disabled and injured athletes more involved in sports. We provide the sporting equipment for them and the environment that allows them to participate in whatever sport that is, Miller explains.
Shaw-Doran serves as director of equipment development for Turtle Ridge, and Miller has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports.
A major annual event for Turtle Ridge is Bodefest, an all-day ski and barbecue extravaganza on Miller's home turf of Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire, complete with autographs, an auction and a chance for children to race their idol.
Watching Miller hurtle down the mountain, swarmed by a speeding army of tiny Bodephiles, it's a wonder and a testament to his skills that the whole thing does n't end in a giant human snowball.
 All the kids want to try and get on the lift with me for at least one run and there's 400 kids or so. It turns into a bit of pandemonium on the way down, Miller says.
Not only is Bodefest a fundraiser, but it's also an opportunity for adaptive athletes to try some of the new equipment on the late-season snow.
 The program's really just changed my life, says adaptive skier Owen Anketell, who has a condition that affects the muscles in his lower legs. I never thought that I 'd be able to ski even though I 'm in a wheelchair -- or bike -- but this program's really changed my opinion on adaptive sports. 
 The key is empowering, says Miller. When we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life-changing that can be for them, I think it's really -- it's pretty incredible. 
The sentiment seems to fit with Miller's general philosophy of focusing on how the sport makes you feel, rather than the end game, a feeling he believes everyone is entitled to, regardless of ability.
It may not be competition, but it is a goal he can take into retirement -- and still win.

"When Lukas Hartmann, 29, signed up for 23andMe's at-home genetic testing service, there were no surprises in his results.
The Berliner learned he would probably die from a mix of heart attack and prostate cancer, he wrote on a friend's blog, but nothing special there. 
Then a few months ago, he received an update from the company.
Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, he says the site told him. Some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy lose the ability to walk and suffer from serious disability, his results page read.
This ca n't be true, he thought. It must be an error.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool. It can offer information about your family history, tell you how your body might respond to different drugs and identify your risk factors for disease.
It can also be misleading.
The Food and Drug Administration on Monday ordered 23andMe to stop sales of its $99 home genetic testing kits, saying the Google-backed company has not proven the validity of its product.
The FDA warned that customers who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental anguish or undergo unnecessary medical procedures. The government agency has asked 23andMe to revise its marketing strategy to comply with federal regulations.
The action triggered outrage among some of 23andMe's supporters.
 So GMOs, aspartame, artificial flavors & colors, pink slime... no problem ! a poster named Laura Ann wrote on the company's Facebook page. But in no way should we be allowed the right to know our own genetic material as a means for making better decisions about our health. 
In a statement, 23andMe said it has received the FDA's letter and will be working to address the agency's concerns.
There are more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code. Though it's been 10 years since the Human Genome Project was completed, scientists still do n't understand what every gene does, and what a mutation might mean for someone's health.
It's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often. If DNA experts do n't understand 100 % what a gene mutation means, how can we expect consumers to ?
5 cool things DNA testing can do
Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. These are disorders that can be diagnosed based on the mutation of a single gene in the body; some examples include Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis.
But conditions such as Type 2 diabetes or Alzheimer's are more complex. Hundreds of genes may contribute to the development of these diseases, Nagy says, and a person's risk is also influenced by his or her environment. Testing for markers of risk scattered across someone's genome is really only testing for the tip of the iceberg. 
 That's where it gets a little scary, because if a person has a normal test result on 23andMe, they leave thinking they do n't have a risk, she says. It's not that the science behind -LRB- this kind of genetic testing -RRB- is n't good. It's that the science behind them is n't complete. 
The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits -- and 23andMe is n't the only company that sells them -- is that they 've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says. She says she believes most early adopters of the tests are information-savvy and understand the results are n't set in stone.
 I do n't think that anyone thinks that this kit replaces formal testing by a doctor, Heather Armstrong posted on 23andMe's Facebook page. I seriously doubt that a doctor would agree to perform, say, a double mastectomy, based on these results. 
Joseph Stolarski posted, If you find something interesting, you then take it to a medical professional for further evaluation. No one is or should rely on it for medical diagnosis.It's just a tool, like personally checking your heart rate with a watch or checking your weight on a scale. 
But Nagy says she worries about what will happen when the tests become more mainstream.
Giving this kind of information to someone unfamiliar with genetic testing's limitations could prove dangerous.
Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor. Counselors have specialized graduate degrees and extensive knowledge of the human genome. They 're also trained in explaining test results to laymen.
 Our message is to be a smart consumer, Nagy says. Know what you 're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit. 
Hartmann did some intense investigating, saying he looked at the raw data 23andMe provided him. He eventually found he did indeed have two mutations, he says, but they were n't on the same gene. He says he submitted his bug report to the company and it apologized.
In general, Hartmann thinks it's a good thing for every person to have affordable access to his or her genetic data. But he's browsed the community forums on 23andMe. com and has seen how seriously some people take their results -- without fully understanding them.
Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.
 I can live with that, he wrote. For quite some time, I hope.

"In today's world, it is not unusual for people to board a plane, and be halfway around the world within hours. The jumbo jetliners in use today are commonplace in most developed countries, but there was a time, not long ago, before air travel was even possible. That was before Orville, and Wilbur Wright built and flew their first aircraft in the early 20th Century.
 
On December 17, 1903, the brothers made their historic flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, officially opening a new era in travel. Their contributions to the new science of aeronautics continued for at least 10 years after that historic day. What separated the Wright brothers from other aviation pioneers was that the brothers developed an effective mechanism to control their airplane. Their three-axis control system is still in use today, more than 100 years after its development.
The first flight was not a very long one. It totaled only 120 feet long, 10 feet high, and only 12 seconds in duration, but it was flight. Orville piloted the plane, as Wilbur ran alongside. There were only five eyewitnesses to the flight, but one photographer captured the image on film, and the rest was aviation history.
The brothers were very protective of their new invention, and made it difficult for reporters to chronicle their efforts. This led to widespread rumors that the entire thing was a hoax. For the next several years, the brothers worked to refine their flying machine in secret, leading to more doubt. However, in 1908, the brothers took their invention to Le Mans, France to put on an exhibition. Wilbur guided his aircraft making turns and other maneuvers, which amazed the crowd. Soon, the Wright Brothers were famous. They changed the way people travel.",B2
"The New York City Opera needs $7 million in fundraising by Monday or it could be closing its curtains for good.
On top of that money, the opera company wants to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 towards future seasons, according to a press release.
 If we do n't raise the -LRB- $7 million -RRB- by the end of Monday the board is going to begin the process of bankruptcy, spokesperson Risa Heller told CNN on Friday.
The company started a campaign to raise $1 million of that $7 million through an online fundraising site -- Kickstarter.com -- that will end September 30. As of Friday the online campaign had raised only $202,223 donated from more than a thousand supporters.
The organization raised $1.5 million outside of Kickstarter campaign, according to Heller.
 The odds have been against us for a long time, George Steel, general manager & artistic director for the company, said in an online video, but in the face of that difficulty we have made tremendous progress. 
The company, dubbed The People's Opera by former NYC Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said.
Steel explains that in order for the company to break even, it would need to sell every ticket for $600, but instead the starting ticket price is actually $25 to make it more affordable.
The New York City Opera received critical praise in the past for its world premieres of work including Robert Ward's The Crucible and Anthony Davis The Life and Times of Malcolm X. 
The company opened its current season on September 17 with the opera Anna Nicole, and should it fail to raise the necessary funds by Monday, that could be the Company's last production.
 We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year, Steel said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. We need you to come together and carry it forward into the future. I hope we can count on you. 
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943, making it the second opera house in NYC. The Metropolitan Opera was founded over 60 years earlier, in 1880.

"David Goldman says he ca n't understand why he ca n't have custody of his son following his ex-wife's death in Brazil. The U.S. government agrees.
David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth.
Goldman told CNN's Larry King he had no idea when he dropped off his wife and 4-year-old son at Newark International Airport in 2004 for a two-week vacation to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that he was about to become embroiled in an international custody battle.
Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with their son, Sean.
The running custody battle has taken many twists and turns and has gained the attention of the Department of State and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
 A child belongs with his family, and there is no reason why David Goldman should not get his child back, Clinton said in a recent interview on NBC's Today show. And we 're hoping that that will be resolved very soon. Obviously, if not, we will continue to raise it with the Brazilian government. 
For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son. It's a case that has been complicated by Bianchi Goldman remarrying, getting pregnant and dying during childbirth last summer. Sean Goldman is said to be living with his stepfather, who has been granted provisional guardianship.
 I went down... to bring my son home, Goldman said on CNN's Larry King Live Wednesday, figuring his ex-wife's death had made the custody issue a moot point, and we find out that this man does n't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. 
Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government.
 The Department of State is working diligently to ensure that David and Sean Goldman are accorded their rights under the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil right aspect of International Child Abduction, the agency said in a statement. We 'll continue to insist that the Brazilian government fulfill its obligations under the treaty and international law. 
The convention, to which Brazil is a signatory, is a multilateral treaty, which seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return, according to the Hague Convention Web site.
Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings that New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened. As a result, the case remains a stalemate.
 I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him, Clinton said in the NBC interview. His son is the most precious person in the world to him and he has gone not just the extra mile, but mile after mile, back and forth, trying to make it clear that his son Sean deserves to be returned to him. 
But on Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a Bianchi family spokesman, questioned Goldman's fitness as a parent.
 I do n't question the biological right, he said. The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you 're not there.
 And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so, Ribeiro said.
Goldman visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month -- a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when it was time to return to the United States.
 He asked me why I have n't come to see him in all this time, Goldman told Larry King, and that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. I did n't want to tell him that... they 're holding him. 
International custody fights are common and were supposed to be simplified by the 1980 Hague agreement, but conflicting court systems and conflicting accounts of relationships can trump international law. The next step in this case is uncertain.

"Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs. He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases. He tells how in his late teens, after his mother died, he became drawn into a south London gang, which, at the time, helped fill a huge vacuum. 
""They became my new support group,"" he says. ""At first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. They got involved in criminality. That is how it was."" At school Smart failed his GCSEs, then retook them at college and passed the lot. He secured a full-time job in administration and worked as a DJ. But, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang. 
Eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years. Instantly, he says, his sense of invincibility was shattered. ""The first night after I was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,"" he says. ""I had been living a dual life. I had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers' enemies. I spent a long time sorting myself out."" 
Today, Junior Smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. Most of those working there are, like Smart himself, ex-offenders. A few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help. They work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across London. 
For Smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed, from within, a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates. He recalls a drug addict he befriended who, to his dismay, kept returning. ""I was touched by the people who kept coming back in,"" he says. ""I couldn't believe that nothing was being done about it. I was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the 'index' offence."" 
""One guy had a GBP300-a-week cocaine habit, which he funded through burglary. He would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. So although he had a drug addiction, it never got dealt with. The thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door."" 
That case and scores of others persuaded Smart to start working as a prison ""listener"" - an inmate who helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside. From there he developed what he calls his own ""little plan"" to run his own scheme once out of prison - using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. He was released early, after five years. ""At the end of my sentence I got an opportunity to put my little model into practice,"" he says. 
So what does he think now? Does he believe that, after the riots of last August, and the government's promise to crack down on gangs, things are getting better? He is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good. But overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. He agrees with the findings of a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. He says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang. 
He draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad. ""When you arrest the top guy, people start fighting for position all the way up. Who was the most loyal? Who had the most respect? It is a bit like a family. They are more likely to act out, through violence. It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect. They have not even given the community a respite."" 
Can it actually make the streets more dangerous? ""It can do, because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent, creating new lower levels all the way down ... People take sides. If one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder [leader] has been taken out, then they suddenly think that gang's weak ... And so we have inter-estate disputes going on. And what happens when that elder is in prison? He forms alliances with other gang members, or when he gets released he then tries to retake control. That is when violence happens."" 
In order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. The youngest members are called ""tinies"". ""Over the last years we have seen more and more of this. The tinies can be as young as eight to eleven years old."" The young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk. It is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says. 
Smart says that, with a lack of government funding and commitment to long-term rehabilitation, the challenges are immense, particularly in the current economic climate. ""I try to engage a young person who has been earning GBP300 a week through illegal methods. It was hard before, to try to convince him. But with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things tougher."" 
That said, his project, which has well over 1,000 clients, is delivering results. Fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. From personal experience, Smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on. ""I don't think that about anybody,"" he says.

"Johnny Depp is an American film star known for taking eccentric roles that many Hollywood stars would not. He has won two awards for best actor, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actor's Guild Award. Depp has played some of the most endearing characters in modern American film history, making him one of the most popular actors in America today.
 
Depp was born in Kentucky, but raised in Florida. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 to pursue a career as a Rock 'n' Roll musician. He gained very little success as a musician, and was introduced to acting by his former wife while they were visiting Los Angeles.
After debuting in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Depp got his first break when he was cast in the popular TV show 21 Jump Street. The show ran for several years, and Depp began getting noticed by Hollywood producers. His first huge hit was playing an artificial character in the film Edward Scissorhands. This role was the first of many odd characters played by Depp. Edward Scissorhands was critically acclaimed, and won several industry awards.
Depp followed his success in Edward Scissorhands with a series of strong roles. In 1999, he played Ichabod Crane in the movie Sleepy Hollow. His performance was well received by critics, and audiences alike. His most successful role was playing Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, another eccentric character. This role was described as a difficult one that only someone like Depp could pull off.
In 2005, Depp starred in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, playing once again a very eccentric character that lived in a chocolate factory.",B2
"There may be no greater entertainer in the history of music in the United States than the late Michael Jackson. The list of Jackson's peers in the industry is very short, to say the least. Jackson began his career in the early 1970s as the youngest member of the musical group The Jackson 5. Michael was the lead singer, and arguably the most talented of the five brothers who made up the band. He was born on August 29, 1958 as the eighth child of 10 in an African American family from Gary Indiana. The driving force behind the group's success was their father, Joseph ""Joe"" Jackson. The group was very popular in its time, but young Michael would go out on his own career soon after. He was a successful singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, and businessman, but his career was not without controversy.
 
 His album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. It was released in 1982, and was followed by a series of successful albums, films, music videos, and business ventures. In 1993 the first of several people came forward to accuse Jackson of sexually improper conduct on a child. This and other accusations would haunt Jackson throughout his adult life. Jackson also gained a reputation of strange behavior. One of the indelible images often associated with Jackson is when he held his newborn child over a hotel balcony to show it to his public.
It was rumored that Jackson bought the bones of the famous Elephant Man, slept in an oxygen tent, and that he altered his appearance to appear white. His photographs from his childhood and as a young adult show a very different Jackson. He married twice in his life including a brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the equally great musician, Elvis Presley.
Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and even his death was not without controversy. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his doctor, who was subsequently found guilty.",B2
"Mexico City sees its share of protests, but this one was unusual.
One woman wept. Other protesters shouted at the tops of their lungs, demanding answers. Still others showed pictures of their relatives to puzzled passersby.
The protesters who gathered Thursday are relatives of 11 partygoers who went missing more than a week ago from a bar in a posh Mexico City neighborhood known as Zona Rosa, or Pink Zone. The area has a vibrant night scene with bars, nightclubs and upscale restaurants on every street.
The protesters say their relatives were kidnapped on May 26 as they were partying at Heaven, an after-hours bar in the neighborhood. All 11 disappeared between 10 a.m. and noon, they say.
The bar is only steps away from Paseo de la Reforma, an iconic avenue in central Mexico City. The emblematic Angel of Independence monument is nearby, as are the U.S. Embassy and the financial district.
Guadalupe Dominguez, a relative of one of the missing, said a witness told her the 11 people were kidnapped by armed men who showed up in SUVs, but authorities say there's no evidence of such an incident.
 A young fellow who managed to escape was the one who told us about it, but we do n't really know anything else, Dominguez said.
Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing
Most of those hanging out at the after-hours bar were in their 20s, except for Yersi Ortiz, who is 16. Maria Teresa Ramos, Ortiz's grandmother, said relatives are mystified and want answers.
 This supposedly happened on Sunday in broad daylight. This could n't have happened during the day and only a few steps from Reforma Avenue without anybody noticing. There should be surveillance cameras that can show us exactly what happened, Ramos said.
Maria del Carmen Zamudio, another relative at the protest, said the witness told them the young people were all suddenly told to leave.
 The -LRB- bar -RRB- owner apparently told them that there was going to be a police operation and turned the lights off. He told them to get out, and armed men in black SUVs were already waiting for them outside, Zamudio said.
Police say there was no such operation. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said authorities are treating the incident as a missing-person case because so far, there's no evidence the young people were kidnapped.
 For now, we have n't been able to confirm how this happened or the specific location where -LRB- these young people -RRB- were kidnapped. What we have is a missing persons report and the knowledge that they 're missing. We have to do something to find them, Mancera said.
Inside San Pedro Sula, the murder capitalof the world
Mexico City District Attorney Rodolfo Rios Garza said security cameras at the bar were not working, but authorities are relying on city cameras in the neighborhood.
So far, he said, an analysis of video from the cameras does not show any violence in or around the bar where the kidnapping supposedly took place.
Authorities searched the bar and found illegal drugs but no signs of forced entry or anything that would indicate the young people had been kidnapped, Rios Garza said.
More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels, according to Mexico's Interior Ministry. Authorities do n't have data about how many of the disappearances are connected with organized crime.
The 26,121 disappearances occurred during former President Felipe Calderon's six-year administration, which ended on December 1 when Enrique Pena Nieto assumed the presidency.
The bar has been shut down while the investigation into the disappearances continues. The Mexican attorney general's office has also joined the investigation.
Last month, Malcolm Shabazz, the grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, was beaten to death at another Mexico City establishment.
Shabazz, 28, was found just outside the bar by police at 3:30 a.m. one block south of Plaza Garibaldi.
Two bartenders were arrested in connection with Shabazz's killing, the attorney general's office said. Rios Garza said the men work at the bar, The Palace Club, where Shabazz and three people had drinks. An argument ensued when the staff said the bill was $1,200. Shabazz was beaten while another man was threatened and stripped of his belongings, Rios said.

"After a weekend of intense investigation, authorities are piecing together more details about Friday's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, including the suspect's behavior earlier in the week and a warning from his family that may have come minutes too late.
Officers sent to check on Paul Ciancia's welfare arrived at his apartment less than an hour after the shooting started, police said Monday.
Here is a rundown to get you up to speed:
The suspect
Ciancia, 23, of Los Angeles, is charged with murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport.
He was shot by officers Friday and was in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Sunday.
A source said Ciancia was unable to speak to investigators.
Clues about a motive
Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that more investigation is necessary to uncover a motive for the attack.
But a note found on Ciancia indicated that he wanted to kill Transportation Security Administration employees to instill fear in what the suspect called the agents traitorous minds, FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich said.
According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting. He claimed he needed to fly to New Jersey to help his sick father, but he never said what day he needed to leave, the source said.
On Friday, Ciancia burst into a roommate's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately, said the source, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity.
The roommate obliged. Investigators do n't think the roommate had any idea of Ciancia's plans.
The near-save
Around the same time, Ciancia was sending text messages to family members in Pennsville, New Jersey.
One suggested that something bad would happen.
Although Ciancia has no known history of mental illness, he said in the texts that he was unhappy, and the messages were alarming enough that Ciancia's father decided to call police.
 I felt that it was pretty serious. It sounded as if Paul Ciancia in California was thinking about harming himself, so obviously I knew I needed to make a phone call to the LAPD, Pennsville Police Chief Allen Cummings told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday.
Cummings spoke with a lieutenant there, who told him the department was in the middle of responding to a shooting at LAX.
 At this point, we were n't connecting the dots, he said. They did later when a reporter called the police chief, asking him to comment on the shooting.
Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. Andy Smith says police were first called to check on Ciancia at 10:06 a.m. Officers arrived at his apartment six minutes later, according to Smith.
Ciancia was already gone.
The timeline provided Monday by police differed from that offered earlier by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He said police had arrived at Ciancia's apartment about 45 minutes after the suspect had left for the airport.
According to the LAPD account, they arrived 52 minutes after the shooting, which began about 9:20 a.m., according to police. It was not immediately clear when Ciancia left for the airport.
The attack
About 9:20 a.m. Friday, Ciancia walked up to a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint in Terminal 3. He pulled a.223 - caliber assault rifle from a bag and shot TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez at point-blank range, according to a court document filed by an FBI agent.
Ciancia then went up an escalator but returned to shoot Hernandez again, apparently after seeing him move.
He continued walking and shooting. Witnesses said he went from person to person, asking, Are you TSA ? 
 I just shook my head, traveler Leon Saryan told CNN's Anderson Cooper. And he kept going. 
Chaos and terror inside LAX Terminal 3
The victims
Hernandez, 39, was the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was created in 2001.
 He took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission, said his wife, Ana Hernandez.
The couple, who married in 1998, have two children.
Two other TSA officers -- James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 -- were wounded but were released from the hospital.
Grigsby, who was shot in the foot, told reporters Monday he was injured while helping an elderly man move to a safe area.
 I turned around and there was a gunman, he said. Shot me twice. 
A traveler who was shot in the leg, 29-year-old Brian Ludmer of Lake Forest, Illinois, was in fair condition Sunday.
The police response
TSA officers are unarmed. So it was airport police officers who eventually shot Ciancia multiple times in the chest, also striking him in the face and neck.
Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him that his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciancia. He praised their response, even though he acknowledged that he had moved his officers away from positions inside the checkpoints during the past year.
 The threat... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium; the threat exists from the curbline on, Gannon said. So... we have our people stationed throughout the airport. 
Holder said Monday that the investigation will include a review of security measures at LAX and other airports.
 The responsibility for protecting airport security is not a TSA function but something that I think we need to certainly examine, given what happened in Los Angeles, he said.
Travel delays
The incident forced authorities to shut down parts of the airport, evacuate travelers and put a temporary hold on some departures and landings.
More than 167,050 airline passengers were affected by the incident Friday as a result of cancellations, delays or diversions to other airports, according to LAX. One airline, JetBlue, temporarily moved its operations to Long Beach Airport.
On Saturday, an additional 40 flights were affected, including 30 that were canceled, involving about 4,000 passengers, according to Los Angeles International Airport.
According to FlightAware, a flight tracking website, airlines canceled 236 flights into or out of LAX after the incident Friday morning and 27 more Saturday.
An additional 919 flights were delayed over the two days, FlightAware said.
Some of those cancellations and delays may have been caused by problems other than the shooting, however.
The airport was operating normally Monday morning.
Suspect's family responds
Ciancia's family, in a statement read Monday afternoon by attorney John Jordan in New Jersey, said they were shocked and numbed by the tragic events of last Friday. 
 It is most important for us as a family to express our deep and sincere sympathy to the Hernandez family, the Ciancia family said. -LRB- By -RRB- all accounts, Officer Hernandez was an exemplary member of the law enforcement community and a good family man. Our hearts go out to his family and many others who grieve his passing.
 We wish to convey, too, our hopes that those who were wounded during this incident will experience quick and full recoveries. We also regret the inconvenience experienced by thousands of travelers as well as the administration and the employees of the Los Angeles airport. 
The Ciancia family said they would continue to love and care for Paul.
 We will support him during the difficult times ahead. While we do not mean to minimize the grief and distress experienced by many other families, we hope that the public will understand that this is a very difficult time for our family, too, the family said.
What's next ?
If convicted, Ciancia could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole. The U.S. attorney general would decide whether to pursue a death sentence.
TSA Administrator John Pistole said the shooting has prompted a review of security protocol with partner agencies.
McCaul said better coordination with local law enforcement could improve security at checkpoints.
But the congressman acknowledged that it's very difficult to stop these types of attacks. 
 It's almost like an open shopping mall, he said.

"Hi Linda,
How's it going?
Sorry I haven't been in touch for such a long time but I've had exams so I've been studying every free minute. Anyway, I'd love to hear all your news and I'm hoping we can get together soon to catch up. We just moved to a bigger flat so maybe you can come and visit one weekend?
How's the new job?  
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Helga
Hi Helga,
I've been meaning to write to you for ages now so don't worry! How did your exams go? When will you know your results? I'm sure you did brilliantly as always!
As for me, I'll have been in the new job three months by the end of next week so I'm feeling more settled in. At first I felt like I had no idea what I was doing but now I realise it's normal to feel like that. There was a lot to learn - there still is actually - and I soon had to get used to the idea that I can't know everything. I used to work late a lot and at weekends but I'm slowly getting into a normal routine.
Which means I'd love to come and visit! We really need a good catch up! I can't believe we haven't seen each other since Carl's wedding. How does next month sound?
Anyway, I'd better get back to work.
Congratulations on the new flat! Can't wait to see you!
Love,
Linda",B2
"Kenya's national football team may not have made it to the World Cup Finals in Brazil -- but one man will be there for his African nation.
Stepping into the role of representing Kenya is Aden Marwa, the country's first linesman to officiate at the beautiful game's biggest event.
 Football is my life, football has made my life change a big deal, Marwa tells CNN.
Like many a young boy, Marwa became obsessed with football, often walking vast distances so he could get to a TV to watch a match. Yet despite his passion for the game, he wanted nothing to do with refereeing and for good reason.
 Those times it was hard because a match would hardly finish without a referee being beaten, he explains. The fans were rowdy and you know, the facilities were not very good. 
 You were playing in open fields so the referee could be attacked anytime so when I could see that as a young boy, I did n't love it. So I was scared. 
However, by the time Marwa became a linesman in 1998 at the age of 21, the game had changed dramatically as more resources and education had been funneled into the sport.
 Once you decide you want to become a football referee there are three pillars. One is your medical fitness, two is your physical fitness and then three, the technical fitness, so these can not be compromised. 
By 2006, the ambitious referee got his big break refereeing a game in the Kenyan Premier League before making his international debut as an assistant referee for FIFA just two years later.
Today he holds the accolade of best assistant referee in the Kenyan Premier League and his talent has taken him to sun-kissed shores of South America for the 2014 World Cup, where he has been performing as a reserve assistant referee.
The 37-year-old knows this will be the biggest test of his career so far and is prepared to have the eyes of millions of football fans scrutinizing his every decision.
 Referees have to make decisions in the shortest time possible. I see it once but you, on TV, will see it and see a replay and you can even pause with technology and even review, he says.
 As a referee I only have one angle to look at that... so the challenge that we have as referees, the biggest one, is how to place yourself at the right position and the right moment to make that very important, crucial decision. 
Check out the video below to find out how Marwa prepared for his greatest moment to date and earned his dream job officiating at this year's World Cup.

"When Larry Pizzi, a veteran bicycle industry executive, first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: ""Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?"" 
It's a question that still puzzles traditionalists. Bicycle shops have been slow to stock e-bikes, even though they have been around since the late 1990s. Sales in the US have been modest. 
Pizzi, who is now CEO of Currie Technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the US, believes that's about to change. Others in the industry agree. Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and they're betting the market is about to take off. 
""We're on the cusp of mainstream adoption,"" Pizzi said. ""There are more players entering the category, it seems, with every passing month."" 
The US is an outlier when it comes to electric bikes. Nearly 32m e-bikes were sold in 2014, the vast majority in China, where they are primarily used for transportation. They are popular in much of Europe, too. They're common in the Netherlands and Switzerland; German postal workers use them to get around and BMW offers one for about $3,000. 
Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with - or without - assistance from an electric motor. Riding an e-bike feels like riding a conventional bike with a brisk tailwind; the motor helps you go faster or climb hills but it's typically not the primary source of propulsion. Unlike mopeds, e-bicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they can't travel faster than 20mph. 
There's debate about how many electric bikes are sold in the US and there is no official count. 
Estimates of annual sales range from about 50,000 to 175,000. That's comparable to the number of electric cars sold in the US - 118,000 in 2014. Yet, while many people are aware of the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and Tesla, few have heard of e-bike companies Currie, Pedego or ElectroBike. 
To succeed, the electric bike business in the US must clear legal, cultural and financial hurdles. E-bikes are banned in some states, including New York, although the law isn't strictly enforced. Traditionalists who own and staff bike shops don't like putting motors on bicycles, citing, among other things, the added weight. Some e-bikes are close to 30kg. 
E-bikes are also pricey. While low-end models sell for as little as $700, Court Rye, the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. Top-of-the-line models cost more than twice that. 
The companies that make and sell e-bikes say they can overcome those obstacles. 
E-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. ""Batteries are getting smaller, they're getting lighter, they're getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,"" says Don DiCostanza, the founder and CEO of Pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer. 
Companies like Bosch, the German electronics giant, and Shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business, which should help erode resistance from bike shops. ""This has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers,"" says Currie's Larry Pizzi. Pedego and startup ElectroBike aren't waiting for the shops to come around; they are building their own stores. In the meantime, lobbying efforts are underway to permit the use of e-bikes everywhere. 
Perhaps most importantly, as more cities build cycling infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, bicycle commuting has become more popular. As the US Census Bureau reported in 2014, the number of bike commuters grew from about 488,000 in 2000 to 786,000 in 2012. That's a ""larger percentage increase than that of any other commuting mode,"" the report notes. Electric bikes make commuting more practical - and fun - by easing worry about hills, headwinds, fatigue and sweat. 
Most of our customers are ""ageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid,"" says Pedego's Don DiCostanza. ""The main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills."" Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US and it has sold bikes to tour companies in San Francisco and Washington, DC. 
ElectroBike, which operates 30 stores in Mexico, opened its first American store in Venice Beach, California in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 US stores in a year. CEO Craig Anderson says: ""We want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle."" He tells customers: ""Ride this once and try not to smile."" 
Startups like Pedego and ElectroBike will have to compete with big companies like Trek and Currie, which, in 2012, was acquired by the Accell Group, a public company based in the Netherlands that is Europe's market leader in e-bikes. Accell owns the Raleigh brand, as well as Haibike, an award-winning German electric bike. 
""Accell has great expectations about e-bikes in North America,"" Currie's Larry Pizzi says. ""While baby boomers are still a very important segment, we're finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars."" 
Accell's Yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rear rack. ""You can carry two children,"" says Pizzi. ""You can carry 45kg of shopping. It's a minivan alternative.""

"The balls have dropped down the chute and all six numbers match, so it's time to buy that Audi, book the holiday in the US and phone the estate agent. At least, that's what most lottery millionaires do, according to an analysis of spending and investment by jackpot winners. 
Since its launch in 1994, the lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have won more than GBP8.5bn in total, at an average of GBP2.8m each. The trickle-down effect means that between them they have created a further 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, Oxford Economics. 
Most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on doing the day job and 31% do unpaid voluntary work. The good news for the economy is that 98% of winners' spending remained in the UK. Through their spending on property, vehicles and holidays, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a full-time job for a year. 
Winners have contributed almost GBP750m to gross domestic product (GDP), and generated more than GBP500m in tax receipts for the Exchequer. The bulk of the money went on property, with GBP2.72bn spent on winners' main properties, and GBP170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages. 
Maintaining income was a priority, with GBP2.125bn spent on investments. Gifts to family and friends accounted for GBP1.17bn, and GBP680m was spent on cars and holidays. 
The study, commissioned by Camelot, the operators of the UK National Lottery, to mark the 3,000-winners milestone, was based on research from 100 GBP1m-plus winners. It found that in total the 3,000 winners have purchased 7,958 houses or flats in the UK, or 2.7 each, spending GBP3.3bn. Most winners (82%) changed their main residence, spending an average GBP900,000. 
The new home is likely to come with a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. A walk-in wardrobe was a must for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) opted for a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table. 
Larger properties need maintaining, and 30% of winners employed a cleaner and 24% a gardener. A small proportion (5%) employed a beautician. 
Audis were the favourite cars of 16% of winners, with Range Rovers and BMWs also popular purchases (11% each), as well as Mercedes (10%) and Land Rovers (5%). Winners spent GBP463m on 17,190 cars, with the average price of their favourite being GBP46,116. 
Holidays were also a priority. The majority (68%) choose five-star hotels overseas. The US was the favoured destination for 27%, followed by the Caribbean (9%). Closer to home, however, UK caravan sales have benefited. Over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan, generating sales worth about GBP7.4m. 
Some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to do so, and 6% have invested in or bought other people's businesses. Businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study. 
Andy Logan, author of the report, said: ""The effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we anticipated. Not only does it transform the lives of friends and family, but each win has a measurable effect on the UK economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the UK. The use of each win creates a ripple effect across this generation and very often the next.""

"The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship.
The loss did n't go over well with hundreds of mostly young Canuck fans, who took to the streets and set several overturned vehicles afire a few blocks from Rogers Arena where the game was played.
Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames. Others danced on top of another overturned vehicle. A dull cloud of gray smoke choked some areas of downtown.
iReport: Fires, rioting and looting in Vancouver
Aerial footage showed Vancouver police wading into the unruly crowd that continually taunted and threw things at the officers. Members of the crowd leaped over one street fire, and officers wrestled several fans to the ground.
 We 're unable to release anything formal at the moment but officers are busy dealing with a few core groups of people bent on committing criminal acts like mischief, vandalism, and fights, Vancouver Police Media Relations Officer Lindsey Houghton said in a statement.
 We 're working hard to get everyone home safe. 
Freelance Journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that 1,000-2,000 people were on the streets in downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire.
After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period.
The Bruins blew open the game in the second, after rookie Brad Marchand sprung on a rebound off of Canuck goalie Roberto Luongo to put away his second goal of the match.
 We knew the second goal was going to be huge, Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview. It was nice to get that one, and we kept pushing forward after that. 
Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist.
But the game was really decided by Thomas, who polished off his spectacular playoff performance with a Game Seven shutout to take the coveted Conn Smythe trophy. Tim Thomas -- whose unorthodox goalkeeping mystified the Canucks all night -- set the NHL record for most shots faced and most saves in playoff history.
He also shattered Johnny Bower's 1960s record for most saves in a Stanley Cup final.
Coming into the series, Vancouver was considered the superior squad on special teams, especially on power plays. But that was n't the case in this year's Stanley Cup, as Boston put away five power play goals to Vancouver's two. Vancouver was also outscored 10-0 in the second period.
 We finally brought our game from home on the road, Zdeno Chara told Team Radio Canada. We played physical and took care of the puck, played extremely hard and paid attention to the details. 
Patrice Bergeron's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game's outcome, as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series.
The Bruins now have won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth-most among all NHL franchises, but had n't captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972. They had been to the finals five other times since they last won, but this time marked their first appearance since 1990.
The Canucks have been to the finals three times in their 40 seasons in the league, but have never won. Holding the home-ice advantage, they won the first two games of the series, but lost all three games played in Boston before losing at home on Wednesday.
They were seeking to become the first Canadian team to win the NHL title since the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.

"He is in that landing pattern that middle-aged heartthrobs finally come to: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love.
The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married. He's at a particularly pivotal age. Forget about the 50s being the new 40s -- the 50s are really very specific. Even the most youthful people will start thinking about the meaning of life as the years no longer stretch out in a fantasy of infinity. Those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles.
Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality -LRB- perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident -RRB- and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas. With a nod to the motivation most of us mortals have, they are ready for an emotional legacy. -LRB- Hint: watch for children -RRB-
It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable. He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy. But he has been practicing for this life transition in full view. In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important -- Up in the Air,  The Descendents,  Michael Clayton, among others. Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked.
What we know about Amal Alamuddin
If the reports of his engagement are true, this is kind of what Clooney has done, and what a lot of professionally single men ultimately come to do, especially about love. His apparent fiancee, Amal Alamuddin, is an accomplished and wordly lawyer. Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice. He's picking a woman of substance as well as beauty -- the kind of woman you would want as friend and counselor, the kind of woman who would have the genes to be the mother of your children -- and it's now, because it suddenly dawns on you that you have no time to lose.
In this scenario of the chastened older Lothario, the candidate is young enough to lust after and smart enough for impregnation. It's not that women, especially stars, do n't come to the same point as Clooney and end up in the same position. But biology forces them to make the comparable choice at least a decade or so earlier. Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can do the whole settling-down gambit at almost any age. But he probably understood some ages are better for this than others.
I know this is n't very romantic, but the timing is -- whether the 50-something group knows it or not -- guided by the Grim Reaper. If that sounds bad, it's not.
Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction. No matter how bright your star, you know that only so much time is left to have a profound relationship and, perhaps, a family. This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around.

"Yao Ming is one of the most influential individuals ever to live in the United States of America. So, how does a 22-year-old Chinese male, born in Shanghai, become an international superstar, who changes the way both cultures look at each other? Ming stands 7'6"", which makes him one of the tallest players ever to play the game, but that is not the extent of his power. Ming was tall, and talented.
 
Ming started his career in China, where he played for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association. That was the season when the Sharks won a CBA championship. He was able to negotiate a release from his contract with the Sharks, making him eligible for the National Basketball Association draft in 2002. Ming was one of the most sought-after players ever to come from China, and he was eventually drafted by the Houston Rockets.
Ming found moderate success in the NBA. His size and strength made him a formidable presence. He was so big and talented that he could dominate any game just by being on the court. Ming led the Rockets to the team's first playoff appearance in several years, but his statistical totals were not so impressive. Still, Ming was one of the most popular players in NBA history. The fans loved him, and voted him into the All-Star game eight times.
Ming did create some degree of resentment from other players, most notably Shaquille O'Neal from the Los Angeles Lakers. O'Neal was one of the most dominant players in the game for a brief number of years, and in 2003, Ming outvoted O'Neal in an NBA fan vote by more than 250,000 votes. This angered O'Neal, who vowed to outplay Ming whenever the two giants met on the court.",B2
"The United States of America is the only country ever to land a manned spacecraft on the surface of the moon. The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Armstrong set foot on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969, in what was one of the most watched telecasts in the history of the country. Armstrong became an instant celebrity, whose name became a household word for generations to come.
 
The lunar landing mission was carried out on the Apollo 11 Spacecraft. Armstrong was the mission commander for the historic flight, and was the second and last mission flown by him. There were complications involving the landing module that Armstrong dealt with at the time of the landing. The module was coming in faster than planned. It was destined to miss the landing site by several miles, but some quick thinking by Armstrong prevented a potential disaster.
When Armstrong did step onto the lunar surface, his words echoed throughout the country and the world: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind."" Years later, Armstrong and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) insisted that the quote was incorrect, and was obscured by interference. However, the quote is remembered forever in its original form.
Armstrong received the Congressional Medal of Freedom from President Richard Nixon, and was later awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter. The program was discontinued in the early 1970s. Other countries have landed unmanned missions to the Earth's largest satellite, but to date, no other person has walked on the moon since then. Neil Armstrong, a true American hero, died in 2012 folloing complications from a surgical procedure.",B2
"Investigators expanded their search into Texas Monday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma Sunday night.
Authorities also are trying to find the dead woman's estranged husband, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.
The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said.
Her mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night, the bureau said. Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbsestranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's home, the bureau said.
Lester Hobbs, 46, and Aja are missing and are presumed to be in Hobbscar, said investigators who issued an Amber Alert to try to find her. Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said.
Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said. Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport, Texas, and the alert was issued preemptively, she said.
Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night. Authorities did not say how Hobbs died, but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her.
The RV belonged to Lester Hobbs, and was parked at his relativeshome, Richard Goss, agent in charge of the state bureau of investigation's Lawton, Oklahoma, office, told reporters Monday. Hobbsrelatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tanya Hobbs or Aja, and one of them pried open the door and discovered Tanya Hobbsbody, he said. Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.
The Hobbses were separated, but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile, Goss said. The couple had been together for about five years.
A medical examiner was performing an autopsy, the bureau said, and police want to question Lester Hobbs about the death.
He and the girl are believed to be traveling in his car, a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag number 577-BPW. The two-door car has no hubcaps, and the rear passenger window is covered in plastic, the bureau said.
The Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication.
 Our main concern at this time is to find the little girl, Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters. We know that she does need some medication, and authorities were checking leads regarding that, he said. He did not specify Aja's medical condition.
Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history but did not elaborate. The Sheriff's Office said he had prior felony convictions.
Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him.
Aja's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said.
Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said. She has brown eyes, and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black.
Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, with hazel eyes and brown hair, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The agency released a picture of him and said he has a mustache but no longer has a goatee.
Geronimo is about 12 miles south of Lawton, Oklahoma, in the south-central part of the state.

"In Canada's Arctic, summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day. For some, it's a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter. But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset. 
""I haven't fainted once,"" said 29-year-old Abdul Karim, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011. This year, that means eating at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. ""The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health,"" Karim said. Pointing to his sizable frame, he laughed as he added: ""But, looking at my condition, I don't think fasting will hurt me."" 
As the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims around the world, much of the holy month's focus on community work, prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world. But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic, the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached. 
Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa, some 1,300 miles south of the city - following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city. It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015. ""It's long days, but more manageable."" 
Many in the 100-strong community break their fast together, gathering in the city's brand new mosque - completed in February amid temperatures that dropped as low as -50C with wind chill - for nightly suppers. As they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries, the sun shines brightly through the windows. 
It's a scene that plays out across Canada's northernmost mosques during Ramadan, as Muslim communities wrestle with the country's unique geography. The 300 or so Muslims in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan, said Nazim Awan, president of the Yellowknife Islamic Centre, with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill. ""There might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours, but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina."" In recent years, much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta. Some, such as Awan - a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting - follow the timings of Mecca. He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton. 
""If I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times, my son might say, 'Papa, you are really insane. What are you doing?'"" he said. Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun, the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, have also been following Edmonton's timetable. ""We currently have 24 hours a day of sun,"" said Ahmad Alkhalaf. ""There's no sunrise or sunset."" 
The adherence to Edmonton's schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. ""My first Ramadan here was in December. There's no sun at that time; it's dark all day and night. So we used Edmonton time."" At times, it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, Alkhalaf said. ""You're supposed to break your fast when it's dusk and we eat when the sun is out. It's not usual to have iftar [the meal breaking the fast] when the sun is up,"" he said. In Inuvik, where much of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions. The iftar meal includes dates and rich curries - as well as local game such as reindeer, prepared in accordance with Islamic law. ""We make a soup or curry ... but instead of using beef, we use reindeer."" 
In Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that 2016's timing - stretching across some of the longest days of the year - has made it one of the more challenging of recent years. It's particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset. But, his efforts will be rewarded years from now, said Karim, thanks to the lunar calendar. Ramadan will eventually fall during winter, which, in Iqaluit, sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day. ""I'll follow those hours, too,"" he said with a laugh. ""Oh yes, definitely.""

" The Berenstain Bears co-creator Jan Berenstain has died at the age of 88, according to a Facebook page dedicated to the furry characters Berenstain and her husband created.
 It is with very sad hearts we inform you that our dear Jan died on Friday, February 24. We are grateful for all of your very kind thoughts. Please remember her family at this very difficult time, said a statement on the Berenstain Bears Facebook page.
Berenstain and her husband, Stan, were already successful cartoonists when they decided to transition to writing children's books.
According to publisher Harper Collins, The Big Honey Hunt, published in 1962, was the first book starring the bear family.
Since that time, more than 330 Berenstain Bears books have been published over the past 50 years, the publisher said.
More than 260 million copies have been sold, making it one of the best-selling children's book series in history, Harper Collins said.
The Berenstain Bears stories were so popular that the storyline was made into an animated TV show special on NBC in 1979 and then a hit daily TV series that began on PBS in 2002.
After Stan Berenstain died at age 82 in 2005, Jan Berenstain and her son Mike continued to write and illustrate new adventures for the Berenstain Bears, according to the Berenstain Bear Facebook page.
Berenstain lived in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, according to her publisher.

"Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.
Polygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.
A grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith.
On Thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. Those offenses took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment.
Both indictments state that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -LRB- FLDS -RRB-, committed the offenses as an accomplice. 
According to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2 1/2 years in prison.
 The cases involve two separate victims, Smith said in the statement. Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved. 
Jeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.
The trial initially was set to begin in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to recent information in the case, but he did not elaborate.
The judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection.
Utah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape.
During his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffsdefense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual.
The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was so scared during the forced wedding.
 The whole time I was crying, she said. I wanted to die. 
The rape as an accomplice charge is a first-degree felony in Utah, carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison.
Jeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.
Those charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah.
Jeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months.
The FLDS freely practices polygamy in the towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, which straddle the state line. The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico.
The offshoot sect broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy.
The Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffsgroup. E-mail to a friend

"When it comes to deciding where the money goes, the Lotus Formula One team says its main priority is the car -- not the star driver who sits in the cockpit.
Kimi Raikkonen said last week that he decided to leave it and rejoin Ferrari for the 2014 season because Lotus have n't got my salary. 
But the team, owned by Luxembourg-based investment group Genii Capital, has now responded by explaining that it prefers to focus its finances on developing the car, even if it means seeing their driving talent walk away.
Raikkonen has posted Lotusonly victory this year, with himself and the team both fourth in the respective driver and constructor standings.
 Our suppliers and key people who develop the car were our priority -- maybe not Kimi, Lotus team principal Eric Boullier told the official F1 website.
 Kimi was in a similar position last year and it was all settled by the end of the year. And Genii had the plan to do the same this year.
 It is public knowledge by now that we 've been late in paying him, and he got upset.
 To manage the cash flow -- and I do n't mean the money itself or the budget we have, which is guaranteed by Genii, or at least most of it as we do n't have the revenue stream to allow us to live independently from Genii -- this cash flow is an issue if you have fixed costs and want to keep up the development level.
 You have to decide where you want to spend your money. 
Genii Capital took full control of the team -- which has raced in F1 since 1981 under its previous guises Toleman, Benetton and Renault -- from previous owner Renault in 2011.
Ownership by a private investment company, instead of car manufacturers such as Mercedes and Fiat, which owns Ferrari, or a global company such as Red Bull, can provide a more risky financial backdrop for an F1 team.
But Boullier says that Lotusalternative business model does not mean it is mired in a financial crisis, as the rumors circulating in the sport would suggest.
 Red Bull or Mercedes, those companies are sponsoring the teams, said Boullier, whose driver management company Gravity also has connections to Genii. Genii has a different strategy: they loan the money.
 It is part of the strategy that partners join the team and Genii will get back their investment.
 Seventy-five percent of the debt Lotus has comes from Genii. They could write it off tomorrow by saying this money is a sponsorship -- and then our debt would be drastically reduced. Our normal debt is similar to most of the other teams. 
Genii's strategy of choosing to bankroll the team before looking for sponsorship deals to recoup their investment is a gamble.
Having 2007 world champion Raikkonen on board would have inevitably helped attract sponsors, but now Boullier is looking at alternatives.
He says the team plans to emulate the business strategy of some of rivals, including Red Bull and McLaren, by looking for a title sponsor.
 It is no secret that for quite a while Genii have been looking for partners to make sure that we can bring more money to the team and have access to a bigger sponsor portfolio, the Frenchman added.
 We need to secure sponsors, as this is the only way to step up.
 Formula One depends massively on the people -- and to attract the best people to a team you need to have money, to be able to build something for the long term.
 Genii's plan was to bring the team up within five years -- which we are trying to do -- but to move to the next step you need another five-year plan in place. And that is what we are working on.

"One of the darkest days in American history was September 11, 2001. This is ""a day that will live in infamy"" for most Americans. It was the most tragic day in the history of the country since December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. September 11th was the day Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial airliners in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by slamming those jets into four buildings. Three of the four jets reached their targets, while one was stopped by a group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.
 
In the early morning hours on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. A few minutes later, Flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, struck the south tower. Both suicide attacks brought the towers down, but not immediately. It took time for the extreme heat from the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers to their eventual collapse. At about the same time, American Airlines, Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capitol, Washington D.C.
The fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also headed for the capitol city. Most people think its target was either the capitol building, or the White House, the president's home. A group of brave passengers, upon hearing the news of what was happening in the country, decided to take down the giant airplane even though they knew they would not survive. They stormed the cockpit and took the controls from the hijackers. The plane flew out of control, crashing into a field in the state of Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.
In all, about 3,000 Americans lost their lives on that day, but the American spirit was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks were quickly dealt with, and the country soon began its journey to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America will never forget.",B2
"A rich kid gets pulled over driving a yellow Lamborghini in Miami Beach by police and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence while allegedly street racing. It happens, but when it happens to Justin Bieber, it's beyond a big deal.
The teen idol is just the latest young star to run afoul of both the police and public relations folks. But is it to be expected when a teen has both fame and access to so much wealth ?
Tons of young stars with more money than years behind them have run into such troubles before. For many, standing on the precipice of adulthood or just over that line, has appeared to trigger a spate of issues
In recent years, Lindsay Lohan, Chris Brown and Amanda Bynes have dominated headlines with legal issues and rehab stints.
 These kids do n't have their identities set and no one says no, said Sherrie Campbell, a psychologist and author of the book, Loving Yourself: The Mastery of Being Your Own Person. 
 These kids get all this money and they stop feeling themselves so they act out and they act out until they get in trouble, almost in that they have to lose everything in order to experience what they have, she said.
Bieber has had both.
According to Forbes, as of June 2013 the 19-year-old had earnings of $58 million. Since being discovered on YouTube in 2008, the singer had enjoyed an almost squeaky clean image until last year.
Then the dogs from bad publicity hell were unleashed.
From being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and the run-ins with police -LRB- authorities recently swarmed his mansion is Calabasas, California, as part of a vandalism investigation -RRB-, Bieber spent most of 2013 in the news for alleged bad behavior.
His musical mentor Usher Raymond, a former teen star himself, told MTV in December 2013 that his young protege was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight.
 With success comes great responsibility. And being able to grow up in it and unfortunately be analyzed in front of the world for just growing up, I think they will be able to see the truth, Usher said. And they can make an assessment based off of what his reality looks like. 
Lately, Bieber's reality is not looking so great.
Meet Justin Bieber's inner circle
Former child star Danny Bonaduce said on his Seattle radio show on KZOK-FM Thursday that Bieber's recent arrest could be just what the embattled teen star needs right now.
 This is the best thing that could have happened to him, said Bonaduce, who in the past has struggled with addiction and legal troubles. Speaking from personal experience, this could save his life. 
Some of his fellow celebrities have condemned his behavior while others have offered support. Psychologist Sherrie Campbell pointed out that fame is its own addiction and said celebs are often under the pressure of the public's expectations.
 I think sometimes these stars think they have to live up to their own image to the point that they almost becomes fans of their own image, she said.
Bieber arrest: Celebs offer sympathy, but jokes, too
For some young celebs, that type of skid is almost a rite of passage at this point. Britney Spears went from pop princess to investigated mother when in 2006 she was videotaped driving with her then-infant son Sean in her lap. A deputy was sent to Spearshome to investigate, though no charges resulted from the incident.
What followed was a year of outrageous behavior including the infamous hair shaving incident, and Spearsfather being awarded conservatorship over her fortune. Since then, Spears has managed to turn her life around, bagged a gig as a judge on The X Factor for a season, as well as a new boyfriend, album and Las Vegas residency.
Other celebs have not bounced back as well as Spears.
See Britney Spears through the years
Lindsay Lohan recently announced she will be starring in and producing a new film, and there's a six-episode documentary series on the way. But her last film bombed and her career is nowhere near what it once was. Likewise, Chris Brown's reputation has never fully recovered from his 2009 arrest following the attack on then-girlfriend Rihanna just before the Grammys. In October 2013, Brown was arrested in Washington on suspicion of punching a man, and then he was kicked out of a rehab facility for acting violently. 
Now Bieber finds himself a member of the club of Hollywood's young, rich and infamous whose mugshots join their paparazzi shots. His being accused of drag racing in a sports car comes just months after an outpouring of sorrow for Fast & Furious star Paul Walker, who died in a crash where speed was a factor.
It remains to be seen what the singer's response will be to his latest troubles. In the past, he has been less than repentant, telling The Hollywood Reporter in November about those who criticize his behavior, I do n't give a f ***. 
 NotI do n't give a f ***to just be reckless and do whatever, butI do n't give a f *** what they say, Bieber reportedly said.

"Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream? 
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were just 41m subscribers using music streaming services globally in 2014. It might be the biggest revenue growth area for the record business but it is still incredibly niche. Not only that, but a significant number of those subscribers come from bundled deals with mobile phone operators so it is debatable just how ""active"" its users are. Apple's greatest conjuring trick is to take something that already exists in the market - downloads (iTunes), digital music players (the iPod) and smartphones (the iPhone) - and adapt it to make it irresistible to the mainstream consumer. Leaked information recently suggested that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually. To put that in context, the entire global worth of recorded music in 2014 was just under $15bn. Apple is good at mainstreaming products but it's not that good. 
Is this the end of downloading? 
The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 (2004 in Europe) at a time when MP3 piracy seemed insurmountable. Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business, which it dominated, with an estimated 70% market share. Downloads still hold the biggest share of digital income for recorded music, making up 52% of total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI numbers. Apple holds the lion's share of this, making it the single biggest music retailer in the world. But download revenue peaked in 2013 in the UK at GBP283m and fell to GBP249m in 2014. The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn, not only to get into the premium headphone market, but also to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming). Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet - so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker. The vast majority of people out there like music but don't love it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it; a sporadic download purchase here and there will suit them just fine. The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just GBP39.52, according to research. Expecting most of them to triple their annual spend on recorded music is something that even Apple will seriously struggle with. 
Has Apple Connect made Apple the most artist-friendly service? 
Apple have previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform via iTunes. They called it Ping and it didn't work. Apple Connect is something very different, somewhere in the middle of YouTube, Facebook and SoundCloud, letting artists post music, videos, photos and more to their profile pages. It couldn't be any more 2015 if it tried. Apple, partly because of its scale and also partly because it treats music as ""art"" rather than ""content"", has generally had strong relations with not just the music industry but artists themselves and, generally, it has a good reputation among artists. Compare that to Spotify, which has been criticized by artists from Radiohead's Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift. In contrast, Apple comes across as a benevolent uncle. There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure it's on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up. 
Where are the artist exclusives? 
This is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live. Getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming. Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively. Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes. It already has AC/DC and the Beatles' catalogues exclusively for download on iTunes but it remains to be seen if it can persuade these two to make the jump into streaming. It also managed to get the surprise Beyonce album in 2013 before anyone else so it is inevitable that it will want more like that. There is plenty of speculation about Apple looking to get exclusive rights to the new Adele album. 
Giving iTunes the download exclusive on an album was not that big a leap of faith for acts given just how much of the download market it controls but trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing. Add into this the fact that streaming now counts towards the album chart in markets like the UK and US and artists, who still see the chart as a measure of success, will not want to limit their audience by restricting themselves to one service. 
Is this going to kill Spotify? 
Some people are already saying that Apple Music will destroy rivals like Spotify. However, it's not that simple. Apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years. It has a lot of catching up to do. The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service; it will be the company with the most money. Apple's competitors have a head start in the market but they are losing huge amounts of money. Spotify, for example, lost EUR93.1m in 2013. Apple, on the other hand, started 2015 by becoming the most profitable company in corporate history, with $178bn in the bank. If Apple Music loses Apple money, the company will not continue it for long but it will not stop investment without at least trying to beat the competition.

"At 16, my innocence was shattered when two gunmen murdered 13 people at my school and wounded countless others.
Columbine High School promised to be a safe and secure place of learning. And that promise was broken on April 20, 1999.
On that morning, I headed to school worried about my 10th grade math test and my upcoming track meet. Useless worries: The test was never given and we never held the meet.
Scars remain from that day that no one can see. Scars that made my worries about math tests or track performance pale in comparison to whether my science partner would live or whether my classmate's speech would be impaired by the shrapnel lodged in his skull. Today, those mental scars throb in large crowds and force me to scan the room for exits. They make my heart beat faster when I hear the blades of a helicopter overhead.
Now, as a teacher in my eighth year in the classroom, I consider every day that I go to work a privilege. I cherish my studentsjoy and enthusiasm, and most importantly, their innocence.
I believe that it is our job, as a society, to protect these virtues in our young people. I want them to be worried about math tests and track meets and about science fairs and student council elections -- the kind of normal school stuff that builds character. But our epidemic of gun violence is creating a culture of fear in our schools, where students are anxious about safety and intruders. These are worries no student should have.
This becomes even more apparent when we conduct our monthly emergency drill at our school. It's a way to be prepared for the worst, so we practice lockdowns, fire drills and evacuations.
The other day, I was explaining to my third graders that we were going to practice a lockdown just in case a bear happened to be on the playground -- a real scenario for our Colorado school. I have used this example my entire teaching career because it's an easy and nonthreatening reason to practice a lockdown.
One girl raised her hand and asked: Is this what we would do if a bad guy came with a gun to hurt us ? I felt kicked in the stomach when I heard this question. A bear is no longer the worst thing for students to anticipate: They fear what is happening across our nation.
It is a shame that my students must learn these drills at such a young age -- a shame they must learn them at all. I thought to myself, This is a result of the Columbine shootings, along with so many other acts of violence. This is my reality, and now it is theirs too. 
It is a sad reality, but we are not helpless. I teach at a wonderful school, which has done everything within its resources to keep our students safe. But it is not enough. If there were a simple solution, then this epidemic of violence would have ended. The solution is complex, multifaceted -- and achievable. I believe a comprehensive approach can help ensure a safe learning environment.
a $cents Our children deserve more mental health resources to identify, treat and follow up with people who need help.
a $cents Our children deserve enhanced school security: This includes identifying who is in the school and sensible steps to keep the building secure -- without bringing guns into the place of learning or turning it into a fortress.
a $cents Our children deserve common sense gun legislation: I believe this should include a ban on high-capacity magazine clips. And at the very least, it should include comprehensive and enforceable background checks to help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Unfortunately, our Congress refused to take this common sense step and turned this legislation down.
The shooters at my school obtained their guns illegally, through private sales and straw purchases. Today they could easily go online and buy those same weapons without a background check. What is to stop the next person who chooses from doing just that ?
We can do better.
I think I can speak for all of us that the murders at Columbine High School, the Aurora movie theater, Sandy Hook Elementary, and so many others shocked us to our core and created lasting feelings of sadness. But we ca n't let these events create feelings of vulnerability. We have the power to work together to create a safer world for our students.
Learn from my experience -- do not wait until you experience violence first hand to realize that we need to take action. We need to take action now.

"Seven police officers were killed and nine were injured Tuesday in a series of attacks at security checkpoints in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, police said.
The attacks happened in the town of al-Rutba, a predominantly Sunni Muslim community that for a few years was an al Qaeda stronghold after the 2003 U.S-led invasion of the country.
In Tuesday's first attack, a suicide car bombing at a police checkpoint in northern al-Rutba killed four police officers and injured three others, said police officials in Ramadi, the provincial capital.
Gunmen later attacked several security checkpoints in the town, killing three police officers and wounding six, police said.
Information about the attackerscasualties, beyond the suicide bomber, was n't available. Al-Rutba is about 435 kilometers -LRB- 270 miles -RRB- west of the country's capital, Baghdad.
Also Tuesday, a car bomb exploded near a busy market in the central Iraqi town of Musayyib in Babil province, killing one person and injured 11, police in Baghdad said.
Musayyib, a largely Shiite town, is about 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- south of Baghdad.
Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites make up a majority of Iraqis.
So far in 2013, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Iraq. More than 350 of those deaths came this month, and almost 1,000 happened in September.

"Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for her number to be called. She is number 34. 
When it's her turn, Maria is called forward to pick up a brown paper bag filled with essentials including pasta, eggs and cornflakes, and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this week's vegetables. 
Maria is the 34th ""client"" so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world. By the end of the day, the food pantry's organizers expect more than 400 families to have followed Maria through the doors to collect their weekly food parcel to help them get through the cold, dark Long Island winter. 
In the summertime, the Hamptons, a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan, is a billionaires' playground. But, come Labor Day in early September, when the rich and famous shut up their mansions and head back to Manhattan or Beverly Hills, the glitz gives way to the gritty reality of life for the mostly immigrant community who live here all year. ""The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not,"" says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter. 
Maria laughs when asked if she has enough money. ""There is no work in the winter, only in the summertime,"" says Maria, who, like many of the workers in the Hamptons, is from Latin America. ""Here, lots of people live in a single room because they can't pay the rent."" 
She says some families with up to five children are crammed into basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent. ""People come here looking for work but, in the winter, there is nothing."" 
Lots of her friends can't pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town. 
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing. ""Once Labor Day comes and the season is over and people's hours start to be cut back, our numbers go up to about 400 families a week,"" she says. ""When they come to us on Tuesday, they get two to three days' worth of food. Without us, they would struggle that much more."" Littman says it can be hard for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to get by in a place known the world over for its excess. 
""When I discuss with the summer community that comes out here about the food pantries, they're always shocked because there is that glamorous side of the Hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and the mansions that are here. ""But, what people don't realize is that there is that service industry. It's the landscapers, the nannies, the waitresses - they are all relying on that summer income to get them through the winter but people don't see that when they're coming out on holiday. 
""There are seniors who have to sometimes pick between whether they are going to pay for their medications or pay their bills or buy food, and that shouldn't be the case."" 
Littman says the town has lost too many people working key jobs - such as teachers, police officers and even doctors and dentists - because they can't afford to live in the community and the food pantry board is determined to do more to ensure people have a better shot at staying put. Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons. At $147m, the nation's most expensive property is hedge fund manager Barry Rosenstein's 18-acre beachfront estate at 67 Further Lane, a stone's throw from Maidstone Golf Club, which is considered ""the most elite, prestigious and difficult to get into"" of all the Hamptons clubs. 
Larry Cantwell, East Hampton's town supervisor and lifelong resident, says homes regularly change hands at more than $25m and the rapid price inflation at the top end has trickled down to even the town's most modest flats. 
""Finding your first home is a challenge in an area like this,"" Cantwell says. ""Not just people who you would characterize as poor - working- and middle-class families are also having a hard time. If you can find a home to buy anywhere in East Hampton for $500,000, you're very lucky."" Cantwell says more than half the town's homes are empty for most of the year, which causes the population to dwindle to as little as 10,000 in the winter months compared with 80,000 in August. ""It's kind of the tale of two cities. There's certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer,"" says Cantwell, the son of a fisherman father and a house-cleaner mother. ""But, the rest of us live here year round. 
""There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by. You've got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and fishing community of people who lived off the land and the water - a real working-class community."" 
Cantwell says saving up enough money to buy your first house while working as a farmer or fisherman is near-impossible in East Hampton today ""and it's not just the poor - police officers, teachers, young professionals and others all struggle to find a place to live here and many of them cannot afford to own their own home."" 
Being homeless in the Hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus. Various houses of worship have joined together to ensure there is somewhere for the homeless to spend the night over the winter. Churches up and down the north and south fork of Long Island take on the burden one night at a time and roughly 50 homeless people are bussed between them every day. Eddie Vallone, 22, is one of those on the bus every night. ""People look at the Hamptons as some sort of rich town and there's no problems going on. But there are a lot of problems here, especially drugs. 
""It's hard to really grasp -'OK, the summer is coming to an end. What am I going to do for the winter?'"" Vallone says at Maureen's Haven, a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter programme. ""I want to work but there's no work to be done."" 
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well and doesn't impulse-buy, he can make his summer earnings stretch out until November. ""But, work doesn't start again until May or the beginning of June.""

"Why do it? Talking to the men earmarked to be the elite referees of the future, the question elicits a knowing smile. This season, criticism of referees has increased to the point where some former referees have felt compelled to complain about standards. That is quite striking because, the more you talk to referees, the more obvious it is that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental. 
So why do it? Why spend countless hours driving up and down the country to dole out rules, some of which are inevitably going to upset people, trying to climb the ladder until you get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions who scrutinize you and your ability with the aid of umpteen different angles and slow-motion replays? 
A glimpse of an answer appears on the face of Lee Swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 2 -1 win for Grimsby over Woking, a match at level 5 of the English league system. He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match. ""Twenty-two handshakes,"" he explains afterwards, proudly. Symbolically, a full set of handshakes, plus a ""well done"" from both managers, represents maximum satisfaction. ""The buzz,"" as he calls it, of a game that passes smoothly, is something he loves. ""I wouldn't spend so much time away from my family if this didn't mean the world to me."" 
As one of the group that is highly regarded by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) for his potential, Swabey knew he was being watched at that match. PGMOL's chief, Mike Riley, was in attendance, along with Steve Dunn, who is the coach for this level, armed with notes and stopwatch to catalogue every significant move the officials make. 
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress - John Brooks. ""I hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League and officiate some of the top games in this country,"" Brooks says. 
The most the PGMOL delegation got to observe, however, was the way Brooks handled the somewhat tricky situation of calling off the match because of a frozen pitch. It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more high-profile games, the different problems that need dealing with - often, clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement, particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have turned up but will not receive any gate money. 
Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision. A little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time - the match fee at level 5 is GBP95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash. 
Brooks, like Swabey, has clear ambitions to progress. He is under no illusions that developing a thick skin and perfecting strategies to deal with disappointments is a big part of that. How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified? ""Erm ... not great,"" he admits. ""I've been in that situation once where I have made an incorrect decision and it was a deciding goal that was just offside. Your heart sinks. You can't stop thinking about it. 
""I do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in. It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right. In certain situations, you are going to be unpopular but, if you are uncomfortable with that, you are probably in the wrong job."" 
The former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that today's referees have is a world away from what they experienced in their own days. Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all. 
Contrast this with Brooks, who has a coach at the end of the phone. They consult weekly, discuss how his games have gone, study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve. He also has the support of a sports psychologist, Liam Slack, for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game. 
Brooks says psychology is vital in his development. ""One of the things we have talked about is forgetting decisions and moving on,"" he explains. ""There may be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game. Once you have made that, you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision. Liam has taught us some techniques for releasing that decision. Working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness."" 
Jones believes the whole approach can only help. ""I refereed in professional football but, looking back, I was an amateur,"" he says. ""I was going to work - I worked for British Telecom - and I might referee at Newcastle on a Wednesday evening and, 9am the next morning, I was in Leicester trying to speak to customers. I perhaps hadn't slept. Training was ad hoc. We were amateurs in a professional environment compared to now."" 
When the subject of technology comes up, the three former refs are unanimous in their support of it. ""We are all in favour of anything that makes the referee's job better and makes them more effective on the field of play,"" says Riley. Minimizing mistakes is the aim. After all, a bad decision can stick with you for a while. ""The rest of your life,"" notes Jones with a chuckle.

"Yesterday, Stephen returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. His visit took place during the week prior to the Fourth of July. Logically, there were many activities and celebrations in town in preparation for Independence Day. During his stay in the city, Stephen visited a lot of important historical sites and monuments, and he left with a deeper understanding of the political history of the United States.
Stephen spent a lot of time outdoors exploring the important monuments surrounding Capitol Hill. Of course, he saw the White House from its outside gate at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Stephen also visited the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Lincoln Memorial. These statues and pavilions are dedicated to former U.S. presidents. They commemorate the contributions that these leaders made throughout American history. Washington, D.C. also has several war memorials dedicated to fallen soldiers during the major wars of the 20th century.
Away from the Capitol Hill area, Washington, D.C. has many museums and art galleries worth visiting. Stephen enjoyed his visit to Washington, D.C. because he learned a lot more about American history after touring each important landmark.",B2
"One of the most beautiful, and recognizable California landmarks is the Golden Gate Bridge in the city of San Francisco. The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay, and is part of a network of five main bridges that cross the bay in the San Francisco and Oakland area. The region with its bay has one of the most breathtaking views in the world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.
 
It is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable landmark in the entire United States. Construction on the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply mired in the Great Depression. Many people think the bridge was, in large part, responsible for the country's economic recovery because of the number of workers employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to the manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.
The bridge connects San Francisco to the San Francisco peninsula in Marin County through both California State Route 1, and U.S. Route 101. Before the bridge was built, the only way to get from one location to the other was to go around the bay, or to take a ferry across. Construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many thought the project was simply too complex, expensive, and dangerous to build. The construction plan approved concentrated on safety for the workers who would be involved in the construction, and it worked well until February 17, 1937. Remarkably, only one worker had died up to that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed killing 10 men in the tragic accident.
The bridge was completed later that year, and has been in use ever since. It is one of California's great landmarks with people from all over the world drawn to see it.",B2
"One of the greatest barriers in existence during the infancy of air travel was the speed of sound. It was considered impossible to build and fly an airplane that could exceed this speed, but that was before the world was introduced to Chuck Yeager. Yeager was already an accomplished fighter pilot in World War II, but his greatest achievement was after the war when he served as a test pilot for the United States Air Force. It was thought impossible to fly faster than sound during that period, and no one knew if a pilot could survive flying at that speed, or how it would affect him if he did survive. That did not deter Yeager, though.
 
Yeager was born on February 13, 1923 in Myra, West Virginia. He served during World War II as a fighter pilot. He did not start out as a pilot, though. Yeager enlisted as a private who worked as an aircraft mechanic in the old Army Air Forces, where Yeager enrolled into a special program that trained enlisted men to become pilots. Yeager benefited greatly from having superior eyesight. He was considered a natural pilot early in his flight career.
As a fighter pilot in the European Theater, Yeager was shot down in France by German fighter planes. He avoided capture, and helped a fellow pilot to safety after that pilot had lost his leg in the crash. Yeager was awarded a medal for his actions. He demonstrated exceptional talent as a pilot and once shot down five enemy fighters in a single day. After the war, Yeager began a new career as a test pilot, where he flew the experimental aircraft Bell X-1 into aviation history.
On October 14, 1947, Yeager flew his X-1 faster than the speed of sound. He became the first human being to fly faster than sound, and he went on to break more records during his 60-year flight history. Yeager retired from the army with the rank of Brigadier General, and has won many honors for his contributions to aviation.",B2
"The American Revolution was a war of independence fought by those living in the 13 colonies of North America against Great Britain. Those living in the colonies were especially angry about taxes the British were forcing them to pay. People felt taxes were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament. One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials such as newspapers. The colonists called this ""taxation without representation"". Colonists who wanted freedom from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported British rule were known as Loyalists. Before full scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest by patriots, like the Boston Tea Party when Bostonians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor because of a tea tax. On April 19 the first shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the war.
 
Many people were involved in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 4, 1776, patriots declared themselves free. Most people know George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston, and New York.
The British, known as redcoats because of their red uniform jackets, had help from German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. Patriots had support from other Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778. This helped force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However, fighting would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris when Great Britain recognized the United States as an independent nation.",B2
"You could see it in his eyes.
Even before Pope Francis spoke his first words to the throngs in St. Peter's Square, you could look into his eyes and sense the wonder.
The world was looking at him. But he was looking at something, too: at all those upturned faces. At all the eyes staring back at him.
Nothing can possibly prepare a person for such a sight.
In this life, there are moments, and then there are Moments. The first appearance of a new pope on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica has always been a Moment like no other.
Before there was telegraphy, before there was radio, before there was television, before there was the Internet, before there was Twitter, the vision -- the solemn orchestration -- of a newly elected pope stepping onto the balcony was the most dramatic possible way of bringing huge news to the world.
It somehow still is.
 I would like to thank you for your embrace, the new pope said, gazing out at all those eyes.
When authors and orators have searched for ways to express the ultimate example of reverential exaltation, the periodically repeated scene in St. Peter's Square, down through the centuries, has often been the one they have turned to.
Tom Wolfe, in his book The Right Stuff, about the original Mercury astronauts, wanted to describe for readers just what level of devotion the newly named astronauts had received from the American people. The seven pilots had been just that -- fighter pilots, test pilots -- before being selected for the space program. Suddenly, they were something else. People would see them and begin crying.
Wolfe came up with the one ideal analogy to portray the phenomenon:
 The boys would n't have minded the following. They would n't have minded appearing once a year on a balcony over a huge square in which half the world is assembled. They wave. The world roars its approval, its applause, and breaks into a thirty-minute storm of cheers and tears.... A little adulation on the order of the Pope's; that's all the True Brothers at the top of the pyramid really wanted. 
But humility is not required of fighter pilots and astronauts. Nor is it required of rock stars or professional athletes or any of the many other public performers, in disparate venues, who are regularly introduced with carefully planned and marketed majesty designed to elevate them in the eyes of their audiences.
A pope is different, and his introduction to the world is like no other. When Wednesday morning dawned in Rome, a man named Jorge Mario Bergoglio was one of millions of people preparing to commence the new day.
By the time the day was over, he was no longer Jorge Mario Bergoglio, and he was no longer one of millions.
As Pope Francis, he stepped onto that balcony and was greeted by that sight.
From behind his eyeglasses, he took it all in.
The eyes of the world met his.
He asked for prayers.

"Thousands of people protested on Australia's beaches against a shark cull in Western Australia. They asked the state's prime minister to stop the cull, and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson criticized it. Catching and killing sharks longer than three metres began after a number of shark attacks on Western Australia's coast. A 35-year-old surfer, who was killed in November 2013, was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.
But the whole of Australia has had, on average, just one shark-related death a year for the last 50 years. Kate Faehrmann, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said, from a protest in Perth, the state capital of Western Australia: ""We've always said that this idea won't work. Drumlines, which they use to catch the sharks, kill sharks if they're one, two, three metres or more, and also dolphins, turtles and other things. That's why we don't want the cull.""
Thousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of Perth, Sydney and Adelaide, and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland. Faehrmann said the protests showed that Australians wanted sharks to be protected: ""What's amazing is that so many people in Australia love sharks. This has shown that people are scared but thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, 'That's the sharks' ocean. We respect them, we love them and we don't want you to kill them.' Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a shark's mouth, said: ""The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.""
The state government will not say how many sharks they have killed, but some people say that sharks smaller than three metres were released after they were caught on drumlines, floating drums fixed to the sea bed with bait on hooks underneath them. Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no other cull has only used drumlines. Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because Western Australia has the fastest-growing population in Australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.
Richard Peirce, of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would not work and could bring more predators towards the coast. ""The activity in Western Australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks. It is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen a method that is ineffective and counterproductive,"" he said, ""and, even if they monitor drumlines through the day, leaving the lines in at night could attract other predators to the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.""
Worldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks. Seven of the attacks were fatal. This is compared to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year. RSPCA Australia says it believes the cull is wrong. ""There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. We think it is the result of a changing population and changing human behaviour; that is, there are more people in the water,"" it said.
Richard Branson said the idea was not working. ""I'm sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier, Colin Barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. It's going to do the opposite, I think. You're advertising a problem that doesn't exist in a big way and you're going to stop people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it. All you're going to achieve, I think, is to worry people.""

"One of the wealthiest women in the United States is Meg Whitman, Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett-Packard. Whitman is an Ivy League educated individual who is the fourth richest woman in the state of California, and is listed No. 20 on Forbes list of wealthiest women in the United States. She is a graduate of Princeton University, where she earned her Bachelor's Degree in Economics in 1977. After Princeton, Whitman earned her MBA at Harvard Business School in 1979. She originally wanted to study medicine, but changed majors early at Princeton.
 
Whitman has found success wherever she has worked. She began her career working at Proctor and Gamble before joining the Walt Disney Corporation where she served as vice-president of strategic planning in 1989. She also worked for Stride Rite, and Hasbro Corporations. Her biggest success was during a 10-year period working for eBay.
When Whitman took eBay over in 1998, the online auction, and retail business was doing approximately $4 million in sales annually. When she left the company in 2008, the business had grown to an $8 billion giant. EBay went from employing 30 employees in 1998 to employing more than 15,000 during her tenure as CEO at the company. Whitman won several awards for her work at eBay, and Forbes Magazine placed her in the top five most powerful women in the country.
Whitman is a moderate Republican, who endorsed Mitt Romney's failed presidential campaign in 2008. She ran for governor of California in 2010, but lost to Jerry Brown. She hopes to run for president in the future, and is listed as one of the most likely women to become president of the United States.",B2
"Kit Skogsbergh can see it now.
 He would be a sidekick, she told me. He would have a soft and soothing voice.... He would kind of be like Piglet in the Pooh movies because he would be a little cautious and scared of things, but once he knew the plan and how things worked he would warm up to it and maybe by the end of the movie he might not have to roll up into a ball -LRB- and hide -RRB-. He 'd be able to face things head on. 
The 32-year-old from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character out of a pangolin, a little-known, scale-covered mammal that's notoriously shy and, to Kit's point, can protect itself from pretty much anything in the wild -- lions, tigers -- by rolling up into a ball.
The pangolin is being trafficked toward extinction -- sold for its scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for its meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. Pangolins are traded by the ton.
Disney could give the pangolin the celebrity it needs to survive.
I 'd encourage you to sign Kit's petition at Change.org.
If people cared about the pangolin the way they care about tigers or elephants, it easily could be saved from extinction. The trouble: Few seem to realize these awesomely introverted animals exist. They 're little studied and barely understood. They 're also not conventionally cute, which makes it easier for conservation organizations and the public to write them off as expendable. Yet they are essential, valuable creatures.
I recently went to Vietnam and Indonesia as part of CNN's Change the List project to document the massive illegal trade in endangered pangolin species. I had n't heard of pangolins before readers voted for me to cover the illegal animal trade as part of that project; and Kit had n't heard of them until she read the story last week.
 I got about halfway through -LRB- the story -RRB- and my stomach hurt so bad I could n't finish it, Kit told me last week. I had this nagging feeling, you know, to do something about it. 
Kit's petition -- titled Help beautiful and mysterious pangolins by featuring them in an animated movie ! -- had 1,425 signatures as of Monday morning. At least 13 other readers also started petitions urging Disney to put a pangolin character in an animated film or short, according to Pulin Modi, a senior campaigner at Change.org.
Disney and Disney Pixar have the reach to make the pangolin popular. And they do n't have to do it out of the goodness of their hearts. It could be a hit. Pangolins are the ultimate underdog -- lovable and secretive, curious and little-known.
Mother pangolins carry their babies around on their backs; pangolins hang from trees by their tails; and their tongues are longer than their bodies.
Plus, Disney already has a choice of names. CNN readers are voting on a name for pangolin P26, which was rescued from the wildlife trade and was recently released back into the wild in Vietnam. Some of the names would be perfect for an animated character: Pemalu, which is Indonesian for shy ; Bao, Vietnamese for protection. Or Percival, which is alliterative and fun.
 When you introduce a character in a Disney film the animal suddenly gets more recognition and people start talking about it, said Kit, who is a Disney fan.
 That education and awareness is what's going to help shape future generationsminds. Maybe we can start with younger people and they can grow up not wanting to eat the pangolin. 
It might seem far-fetched that any Disney viewer would eat pangolin. But not for Kit, who is Chinese-American and who told me her father likely has consumed endangered wildlife products while doing business in China, possibly including pangolin.
It's been a source of family conflict.
 It's like talking to a piece of cheese, you just do n't get anywhere, she said of her conversations with her dad about the welfare of endangered animals. It's funny to him that people are concerned about what happens to an animal -- because it's just an animal, it's nothing more than that. It does n't offer anything more than food or nourishment or medicinal properties. He laughs and says it makes you live longer or it makes your skin nice. And he 'll say, You 're crazy ! You Americans !
She does n't think she 'll be able to persuade her dad to change, but younger generations may be the ones to save animals like pangolins and rhinos, she said.
And Disney could reach them.
Kit's own story is proof it could work.
Kit was born in the United States, and she developed a fondness for animals when she was young. Her parents valued animals for their function -- Doom the Doberman's ability to protect their home, their duckseggs -- but she saw them as friends.
 Maybe I did n't have enough friends and the animals were always super friendly all the time, she said. I feel like it's pretty easy to make friends with animals. She now has three cats -- Cheezburger, Monster and Ninja -- and a rabbit named Bunny.
She became an advocate for animals because she got to know them.
 As a Chinese-American, I also want to speak up because the demand in China is helping drive the demand for pangolins to be killed for meat and medicines, she writes in the Change.org petition. I can tell you many Chinese citizens do not support this cruelty, and I believe we can bring wildlife advocates from around the world together to ask Disney to take this simple, fun, positive step to help pangolins. 
 It did n't cost me anything but half an hour of my time, she said of the petition.
And it would take far less time to sign it.

"One of the most impactful television series ever to run on American TV was Married with Children. The show aired on the FOX Channel for 11 years, and many believe it was responsible for keeping the news station alive during the early years.
 
In 1987, commercial TV in the United States was dominated by the big three: the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS). When the FOX Channel appeared on the scene, few people gave it much chance to survive in the face of its stiff competition, but Married with Children changed all that.
The show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family that lived in a fictional suburb of Chicago. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was a lovable loser living with his self-centered wife, and bratty kids. Together, the family makes Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and fumbles his way through life. Al works as a shoe salesman that pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.
Al is an endearing character who gained the adoration of the American public for many years. The actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people still approach him to this day calling him Al, or Mr. Bundy. O'Neil also said that playing the character for so many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because people associated him with Al.
One of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was off-limits to the writers. It was a controversial show that dealt with controversial subjects. Many people boycotted the show because of its racy content, but FOX continued on. The show has cultivated a cult-like following that began in the 80s, and continues today.",B2
"The problem with Google Glasses, says Takahito Iguchi, is that they're not cool. He has a point. There's already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. It possibly wasn't Google's smartest move to release the first 10,000 pairs to software developers rather than, say, supermodels or Scarlett Johansson. Search Google Images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. And it's this that Iguchi, a Japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be Google's Achilles' heel. He is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylized. A bit more Blade Runner. A bit more Japanese. 
Iguchi's augmented reality glasses, which aren't really glasses so much as a single piece of metal with a camera and a micro-projector, are called Telepathy One, and, after unveiling them at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. Like Glass, Telepathy One is due to launch in 2014. 
It's a stripped-down, simplified version of Google Glass. Whereas Glass is, he says, ""an egotistical device"" with a range of uses - you can surf the net, read emails, take photographs, do unspecified things with as yet unspecified apps - Telepathy will be ""more of a communication device"". Connected via Bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real- time visual and audio sharing. You'll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email. Or see and speak to a floating video image of a friend. 
""It will help bring you close to your friends and family. We are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,"" says Iguchi, who has worked in the Japanese tech industry for 20 years, most recently developing a location-based phone app called Sekai Camera. 
Of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, I point out. Iguchi shakes his head. ""I'm a visionary. I have a dream that people will understand other people. When I go to London, I am a stranger. Sometimes I feel fear. But I believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. And, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them."" 
Compared to the likes of Google, of course, Telepathy is a minnow. Not that this seems to daunt Takahito Iguchi. In his shared office space in San Francisco - a cool, converted warehouse in the heart of startup land, filled with twentysomethings - he quotes Sun Tzu's The Art of War and points out that even tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty forces. When he was growing up, Japanese technology ruled the world: the Sony Walkman was the iPhone of its day. Now, to compete, he's had to quit Tokyo for Silicon Valley. 
""Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it's still an island. It's isolated. There is not any way to expand. Whereas, in Silicon Valley, everyone is from everywhere. It's where you come to connect globally."" The hardware will be made in Japan, while he is putting together a team of software engineers in the US to develop its applications. On the day I meet him, he's being shadowed by a news crew from Japan who are interested in the new wave of Japanese entrepreneurs being forced to leave their homeland. 
""We are losing our confidence,"" the correspondent, Takashi Yanagisawa, tells me. ""And we need to find a way to regain our power. Iguchi is kind of like the new frontier. We hope he might be a new solution."" Building the prototype of Telepathy One was easy, Iguchi says. ""We have every sort of technology in Tokyo. It is presenting it to the world that is the challenge."" The leading manufacturers are lining up to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. ""There needs to be a story to the product. Like Apple did with the iPod - 1,000 songs in your pocket. And the way they positioned themselves against Microsoft and IBM, it was like the story of David and Goliath. And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle."" 
Maybe. He certainly has the confidence of Jobs, although, with a thick Japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to Telepathy One's conception. When he went to London to present the headset at the prestigious Founders Forum, he stayed in an Airbnb. ""The house owner was not my friend but I talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. That is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. Maybe Telepathy makes that shorter. If you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily. And this man is involved in getting investment from UK to Africa, and he was very excited about Telepathy, that it would be a way of educating people about Africa, of showing them other people's point of view."" 
This is Iguchi's fondest hope - that seeing somebody else's literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. As a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. ""And, one day, I opened the door of my apartment and I suddenly realized that everything is code. That was my enlightenment. Everything is coded and is shareable between humans. And everything can be encoded and decoded. And, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war against each other.""

"Millennials in the workplace
Background
Millennials (those born between the early 1980s and the early 1990s) make up a huge part of our workforce but they seem to lack loyalty to the companies and the leaders they work for. Multinational companies are noticing larger turnover rates of millennials as employee retention rates fall. This report looks at the findings of two large-scale surveys on the mindset of the millennial generation and explores how organisations can strive to address these needs, increase employee engagement and encourage retention.  
Research
In a global survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 millennial (born between 1983 and 1993) and non-millennial responses were collected on the topics of workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work-life balance, etc.
In a separate global survey conducted by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials participated in a study about their perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work.
Key findings
Millennials are as committed to their work as their more senior colleagues.
Millennials value interesting work and a good work-life balance. They do not believe that excessive work demands are worth sacrifices in their personal lives.
Millennials want flexibility in their working hours and are willing to give up pay increases and promotions for a flexible working schedule. They believe that success should be measured by productivity and not by the number of hours they are seen in an office.
Millennials want to feel supported and appreciated by their company and their superiors.
Millennials want more opportunities to develop their skills. These include technological skills, teamwork and interpersonal skills.
Millennials believe that businesses and business leaders should contribute to the improvement of society and they are more likely to be loyal to a company with strong ethics.
Recommendations
Organisations and managers wanting to retain millennials should consider:
monitoring their workload and satisfaction levels with their work-life balance
creating a flexible work culture where employees have more control over their working hours and their work location
providing meaningful work and interesting opportunities
offering help and support in continuing professional development
changing the organisation's goals from being mainly about profit-making to motives that address social concerns and solve wider societal problems.",B2
"Robert Myslajek stops dead. Between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track, the scientist finds what he is looking for. ""Droppings!"" he enthuses. Wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of their faeces marks a good day, even for a seasoned tracker. 
But it is getting easier. There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland. The number has doubled in 15 years. Wolves are - along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine - Europe's last large predator carnivores. Conservationists from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands are beating a path here to find out how the country has saved this protected species, slandered even in fairy tales. 
Bits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces. ""It ate a red deer,"" says the University of Warsaw biologist. ""In my lab, I can tell you all about this wolf - not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections."" 
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers. ""One wolf reached the Netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car. They have a tremendous range. They need space. The average territory required by a Polish pack is 250 sq km,"" said Myslajek. 
""Is there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to Scotland?"" asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a field trip to southern Poland from his college in the UK. The animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruce-clad Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians. 
Their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the British Isles for the first time since the 18th century. 
As the guest of a British charity, the Wolves and Humans Foundation, Myslajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 and took questions from villagers about the Polish experience. ""The big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork. We do not have many sheep here. 
""The similarity is that we have a lot of animals - 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. In Poland, we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar - about 200,000 - and these are ravaging farmers' cereal crops. Here, wolves are part of the solution,"" he says. 
The scientist, who is a familiar face on Polish television, says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt. ""The Beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. This year, we have recorded five cubs, two yearlings and two adults. 
""We track them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow. In each family group, only one pair reproduces, once a year. All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion."" 
Mys lajek, the son of a shepherd, is puzzled by wolves' bad reputation. ""Why does one speak of a 'lone-wolf gunman'? Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood?"" 
He is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs. 
Wolves are not pooches. Myslajek says only scientific arguments - the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population - can save Europe's wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. ""Natural predators balance the ecosystem. They keep herbivores in check, thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in."" 
Shoot the deer? ""It is only a partial solution,"" he says. ""In a diverse environment, you have the so-called 'landscape of fear', where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass. They move away, as a precaution, to avoid being trapped by a predator. This gives the vegetation a chance."" 
The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians came into force in 1995 and nationwide in Poland in 1998. There are now resident packs in virtually all the country's major forests. The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in African safari parks. 
The Polish government pays compensation for livestock killed by wolves. Myslajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences. He has helped revive the use of two deterrents that, for reasons no one quite understands, wolves find particularly scary: red bunting (hung around sheep pens) and the bark of the fluffy white Tatra Mountain Sheepdog. 
The survival and mobility of Poland's wolves has been helped by the country's belated infrastructure development. In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway. Major road projects - requiring wildlife impact studies - began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals. 
Attitudes have also changed. ""For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland. Beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month's salary. It was carnage."" 
Myslajek says the improvement in Polish wolves' survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile. Packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighbouring Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. 
He claims Poland's new government, elected in October 2015, is hostile to wolves. ""The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter. There are 120,000 licensed hunters in Poland and they are influential in parliament. 
""The hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are 4,000 of them in Poland, which is a spurious figure based on an unscientific count. This government is capable of turning back the clock."" 
Being a wolf advocate is not easy. ""It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. They have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell."" 
The 12 British animal science students leave the Polish Carpathians without a wolf sighting; just photographs of paw prints and droppings. Entwisle is convinced that Scotland will never be able to match Poland's success. 
""It would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer. But it would just not be viable because of the roads and sheep. 
""There would be problems with farmers. We had our industrial revolution too long ago. We ruined it for ourselves. In Britain, we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television, said Entwisle.

"The third Monday in January is an American federal holiday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It falls near the birthday of the civil rights leader, who was assassinated in 1968. King, a minister, became known for non-violently protesting the treatment of African-Americans in the United States and laws that discriminated against Blacks. Specifically, King protested segregation that separated blacks and whites in public restrooms, public pools, public schools, on buses, and at restaurants. King led many marches in the United States, especially in the South where segregation was especially practiced and enforced, and in Washington D.C. His march on Washington D.C. was perhaps his most famous one, where he gave the ""I have a Dream"" speech.
 
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, federal, state, and local offices are closed, including public schools and post offices. On the holiday many people participate in marches and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and volunteer in their community by cleaning up garbage in a local park or serving food to the homeless. However, the holiday was controversial. Some states didn't want to honor Dr. King and tried to rename the holiday or combine the day with another holiday.
Only two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a holiday in 1983 after pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to the ones King used to lead. Efforts to create a King holiday began the same year King was killed. The first state to recognize King Day as a holiday was Illinois. The last state to recognize the holiday was Arizona.

"The first time I went to Libya, in 2010, I was arrested just two days into my trip. Filming a documentary for VICE, I was detained for shooting where the authorities thought I should n't, beginning endless rounds of questions, emphatic yelling and head-shaking incredulity at my claims of innocence -- and, of course, the requisite implications that I was a spy. When I was finally released, I swore I would never return to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. But that promise was quickly broken, and I found myself back in the country almost exactly a year later, in the midst of a chaotic and violent revolution.
My second trip to Libya consisted of traveling from the Egyptian border to Benghazi and then onto the front lines in Misurata, embedding with a few different rebel groups along the way. I was shocked by how young many of them were. Barely past puberty and fighting with whatever they could find -LRB- one guy had a spear gun -RRB-, they displayed so much heroism and courage that I would tear up while talking to them. One rebel I spoke with had left the hospital earlier that night -- despite having lost a leg -- so that he could get back to the front lines. He was offered a flight to Germany and a new prosthetic limb by an NGO, but instead snuck out of the hospital to rejoin his comrades.
But the big question looming over everything was: Why are they fighting ? 
Everyone I asked -- bankers, shop clerks, students, construction workers, oil engineers and ex-Gaddafi loyalists -- offered the same answer: Freedom. It was like the end of Braveheart every time a rebel looked into my eyes and said it. One 16-year-old told me, I will die so the others can at least breathe free air. Heady stuff for a teenager, especially when most of the rebels are n't old enough to have known a political system other than Gaddafism. Risking your life for freedom is one thing. But risking it for the concept of freedom is something else entirely.
See the rest of The Rebels of Libya at VICE.COM
When we finally got to Misurata, it was surrounded by Gaddafi's troops and only accessible by sea. We slowly made our way toward the front, stopping periodically to talk to rebels. One 15-year-old boy I met was preparing a Grad-missile truck for battle. Beaming, he wondered whether I could ask Clinton and Obama for new weapons so that they could beat Gaddafi and he could fulfill his dream of playing for the Miami Heat or the Dallas Mavericks. As we talked, it struck me how much had changed in such a short period. This was a different Libya than the one I experienced last year -- a completely new country.

"As outrage grows over a Sudanese woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christianity, the government defended the verdict, but said it's only preliminary.
A Khartoum court last week convicted Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith.
Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, is a Christian, her husband said. But the court considers her a Muslim.
 I 'm so frustrated. I do n't know what to do, said her husband, Daniel Wani. I 'm just praying. 
100 lashes
The court also convicted her of adultery and sentenced her to 100 lashes because her marriage to a Christian man is considered void under Sharia law.
Wani is American, Ibrahim's lawyer Mohamed Jar Elnabi told CNN.
The attorney said he 'll file an appeal within a few days.
Sudanese parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen said the verdict is not final and is in the hands of the judiciary.
The verdict will go through all the judicial stages to reach the constitutional court, the speaker told Um Derman radio station. His comments were cited Friday by the official Sudanese News Agency.
Ibrahim says she was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was age 6, and she was raised by her mother as a Christian.
However, the lawyer representing Ibrahim's family said Sunday that the mother is a devout Muslim.
The court had warned Ibrahim to renounce her Christianity by Thursday, but she held firm to her beliefs.
But the parliament speaker said that claims she was raised as non-Muslim are untrue.
She is a Muslim raised in an Islamic environment and her brother, a Muslim, filed the complaint against her, according to Izz Al-Deen.
The complaint alleges she went missing for several years and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian, according to her lawyer.
However, because her father was Muslim, the courts considered her one too, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void.
Attempts to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister were unsuccessful.
Pregnant with toddler in prison
Ibrahim's husband is struggling to survive.
He uses a wheelchair and totally depends on her for all details of his life, said Jar Elnabi, her lawyer.
In addition to her pregnancy, the couple's 20-month-old toddler is with her in prison, and he is getting regular ailments due to lack of hygiene and the presence of bugs, the lawyer said.
She's having a difficult pregnancy, and a request to send her to a private hospital was denied, the lawyer said.
There also is the question of the timing of a potential execution.
In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende.
Worldwide condemnation
Rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide condemned the verdict.
 The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered, said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
Katherine Perks with the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the verdict goes against Sudan's own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law. 
Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the government to reverse course.
CNN's Catherine Shoichet, Christabelle Fombu, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Mohammed Osman contributed to this report.

"Manchester City crushed Aston Villa 4-0 with Mario Balotelli scoring a hat-trick to go temporarily top of the English Premier League ahead of city rivals Manchester United's 1-1 draw at Birmingham later Tuesday.
Although City were only at the head of affairs for a few hours, the manner of their victory suggested they will be a factor in the title race, but for Gerard Houllier's Villa it was another dispiriting defeat.
Tottenham Hotspur, who won 2-1 at Villa on Boxing Day, beat Newcastle 2-0 in another afternoon kick-off to leapfrog Chelsea into fourth place.
Goals from Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale in the second half maintained Tottenham's impressive recent run and spelt a second straight defeat for Newcastle under new manager Alan Pardew.
Man Utd regain top spot despite draw
Bale scored the clinching second after a trademark surging run after Younes Kaboul had been sent off for the home side after tangling with Cheick Tiote.
At Eastlands, Balotelli proved a real handful for Villa, winning an early penalty after being hauled down by Eric Lichaj.
The Italian got up to convert the penalty and City were 2-0 ahead inside the first 15 minutes as Joleon Lescott headed home Adam Johnson's corner.
Balotelli scored his second from close range before the break and completed his hat-trick in the second half with his second successful penalty after Johnson was fouled by Marc Alrighton.
Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini took a realistic view of their hgih placing.
 I know that we are top but I think it will only be for three hours. It is important to be there at the end of the season, the Italian told BBC Sport.
Elsewhere, promoted Blackpool continued their remarkable season under Ian Holloway with a 2-0 win at Sunderland to go eighth, having been the favorites to go straight back down at the start of the campaign.
Two second half goals from DJ Campbell gave Blackpool three points in their first match since December 11 after their own Bloomfield Road ground was unfit to play due to a frozen pitch.
Chris Baird scored two early goals as Fulham relieved some of the pressure on manager Mark Hughes with a 2-0 win at Stoke, while Blackburn's fans will be happier after Nikoli Kalinic scored twice in a 3-1 victory at West Brom.
Kalinic blotted his copybook by being sent off for a wild challenge in the second half, but it was the first win for new manager Steve Kean, who took over from the sacked Sam Allardyce.
In Tuesday's evening kickoff, West Ham missed the chance to move out of the bottom three when they were held 1-1 at home by Everton.
The Hammers took the lead when Tony Hibbert diverted Radoslav Kovac's overhead kick into his own net.
Everton leveled just before halftime through Seamus Coleman, before Carlton Cole missed a great opportunity to seal victory for the home side after the break.

"Julie was tired of living with her parents. She was 22, and just finished college. She started a new job in an office, and didn't want her parents to tell her what to do anymore, so Julie decided to start looking for an apartment. She started by looking at classified ads in the newspaper and checking on websites like Craigslist.
 
The first apartment she went to see sounded perfect on the newspaper. It was advertised as a cozy one-bedroom apartment with a view. She made an appointment to view the apartment. When the landlord opened the door, Julie was sorely disappointed. The cozy bedroom barely fit a twin mattress and a nightstand. The window actually offered a view of a brick wall.
Julie didn't give up hope though. The next apartment she saw was advertised as having a renovated kitchen. Since Julie loved to cook, she imagined herself cooking gourmet meals on shiny new kitchen appliances. However, the broker showing Julie around explained that the only renovations were new knobs on old wooden cabinets. Julie was beginning to lose hope. She then saw a listing for a basement apartment with access to a low maintenance yard. Julie imagined herself hosting barbecues for her friends until she saw that the low maintenance yard was a tiny slab on concrete.
Julie decided to stop looking for apartments that had features she liked. Instead she was going to look for an apartment close to her job. She read a listing for a studio that was close to a freeway. This meant a shorter commute. When she saw the place, she found that the studio actually overlooked the freeway, and traffic could be heard from the bedroom.
Julie was discouraged. She decided not to move out yet.",B2
"Ronan
I work in a fairly traditional office environment doing a typical nine-to-five job. I like my job, but it's annoying that my commute to work takes an hour and a half each way and most of my work could really be done online from home. But my boss doesn't seem to trust that we will get any work done if left to our own devices, and everyone in the company has to clock in and out every day. It's frustrating that they feel the need to monitor what we do so closely instead of judging us based on our task performance, like most companies do these days.
Jo
I used to do a typical five-day week, but after I came out of my maternity leave, I decided that I wanted to spend more time with my children before they start school. After negotiating with my boss, we decided to cut my working week down to a three-day work week. This of course meant a significant cut in my pay too, as I'm paid on a pro-rata basis. I've since noticed, though, that my workload hasn't decreased in the slightest! I'm now doing five days' worth of work in three days, but getting paid much less for it! I find myself having to take work home just so that I can meet the deadlines. It's wearing me out trying to juggle work with looking after my children and my family, but I don't dare to bring this up with my boss because I think he feels as if he's made a huge concession letting me come in only three days a week.
Marcus
I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home. That means that I don't waste time commuting or making idle chit-chat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. It can also get quite lonely working on my own, and I sometimes miss sharing ideas with colleagues.
Lily
I'm a freelancer and work for myself. This is great because I am in control of what I do and how I spend my time. At first, I was working from home, but I found it really hard to concentrate. There were just too many distractions around: housework that needed doing, another cup of tea, my family members wanting my attention for various things. So I started to go to a nearby cafe to work, but the Wi-Fi connection wasn't ideal and I found myself drinking too much coffee. In the end, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers like myself. I liked getting dressed to go to work in the morning and being able to focus in an office environment. The other freelancers do similar kinds of web-based work to me and so it's nice to have workmates to bounce ideas off as well.",B2
"The small space is set up to look like a classroom. Its corrugated iron walls are hung with educational charts - illustrated letters of the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh. 
But, the constant sound of hammering and the chemicals in the air that catch in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it hard to concentrate. The children who learn in this three-square-metre room are the lucky ones, however. They have escaped working in the factories opposite. 
For 14 years, SOHAY, a grassroots non- governmental organization (NGO) funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child labourers into school. It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions - in aluminium and plastic factories, and tanneries. 
The classroom is one of 23 urban development centres that SOHAY has set up across the capital. The centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. Once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centres, with help from their peers. 
Alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centres. His father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. They are all happy that he's now in school and away from hazardous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. ""I like school,"" he says. 
""The urban development centres aim to create an education-friendly environment in the communities and change their cultural mindset towards the children,"" says SOHAY's programme manager, Mohammed Abdullah al-Mamun. SOHAY also runs sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income. 
""Getting working children into formal education is really very challenging,"" says Mamun. ""Their psychological and physical condition is not like other children in society. After they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. It is also very challenging to ensure they stay in school - the dropout rate is very high for these children. In this context, it's important to work with schools so they have more sensitivity and care about them."" 
Seven-year-old Zhorna Akter Sumayya has two older brothers, both of whom are in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). But, after being introduced to education at one of SOHAY's centres, she now goes to a state primary school. Her family live in the slum and her parents can't survive without the income their sons bring home. Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they were keen for their daughter to go to school. 
In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 vulnerable children - those in danger of entering work - into school. About 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. The organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under Bangladesh's 2010 child labour elimination code of conduct. The policy aimed to eradicate all forms of child labour by 2015 but that target was missed. 
The Labour Law of Bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but, according to the UN children's agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries. 
""It was difficult to get them into school without any compensation for their time,"" says Sadia Nasrin, who runs Sonjag, another Dhaka grassroots NGO. ""To overcome this challenge, Sonjag started working closely with the community in the slums where the children live."" 
The organization talked to community members about why it was important to get children into school. They selected community volunteers who were motivated to change children's lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government. 
""The groups play a vital role in motivating employers to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to ensure a safe workplace for the children. The ultimate change-makers are the community people,"" says Nasrin. 
She adds that people living in slums face threats of eviction, police raids and displacement. ""The national plan of action for children does not recognize the needs of street children,"" says Nasrin. ""Legislative measures are limited."" 
When the children have missed starting school at five years old, it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without an education. ""After they cross their school age, it is really very difficult to admit them into school,"" says Mamun. ""Children are just passing their time without education and waiting to become involved in hazardous work. We are working to block the child labour flow.""

"Carl Sagan was possibly the most famous American astronomer ever. He was an astronomer, scientist, author, cosmologist, and television host. His landmark show ""Cosmos"" was one of the first science shows to gain acceptance by the general public in the United States. Sagan challenged Americans to think about their place in the universe like no other person before him. Using the scientific method, Sagan challenged long-held beliefs about the genesis of life on earth. This he has done to the enlightened scientific community, and to the anger of the religious community. Many of Sagan's teachings contradict the creationist belief of the beginning of life. He was also interested in the search for life beyond the planet earth, and participated in the only human message sent into space intended for an alien race.
 
Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1934. His interest in science began at an early age. He wrote and co-wrote 20 books, and had more than 600 scientific research papers published. His most popular work was ""Contact"", which tells the story of first contact with an intelligent alien species. The book was made into a movie in 1997 starring Jodie Foster. The book and movie angered many religious groups because of its message that human beings are not alone in the universe.
Sagan earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him into developing the television series ""Cosmos"". It was one of the most watched science series, and has been recreated and is currently on the air. His work on the Galileo project lives on today. The spacecraft is speeding its way through infinite space today with his message of greeting to whatever race of beings finds it. Sagan died at the age of 62 from complications resulting from pneumonia.

"America is known as the land of opportunity, where one could achieve anything they put their mind to, no matter who they are. Thousands of people immigrate to the United States every year from different parts of the world to have access to these kinds of opportunities. This is what is known as ""the American dream"". One of the many reasons America is such a great country is the diversity you see all around. America is one big melting pot of citizens from different backgrounds.
 
America is also home to many of the world's top colleges and universities. The California Institute of Technology is a top world-ranked college that focuses highly on science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is another top world-ranked college that you might be familiar with. The buildings at Harvard date all the way back to the year 1636, making Harvard the oldest university in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of California, Los Angeles is another institute worthy of recognition. Located next to Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due to the number of people who apply for admission throughout the United States. The universities mentioned are but a few of the many other excellent schools that make the United States so outstanding.
America is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality. Although our history may be contradictory to these ideals, we have progressed and now live in a land of equal opportunity.

"The worst kept secret in Formula One is finally out -- Fernando Alonso is leaving Ferrari and will be replaced by Sebastian Vettel.
Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with the Scuderia, the oldest team in F1, from 2015.
After ending his five-year stint at Ferrari, Alonso remains coy on where he will be driving next season.
The double move by two of the sport's high profile world champions is the most significant in the driver market this season.
But in the fickle world of F1 there are no guarantees it will work out for either of the ambitious racers.
There are still seats to be filled at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso. With the curtain about to fall on the 2014 season at Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, hopeful drivers have just one more chance to stake their claim for the remaining seats.
Where will Alonso go ?
Alonso is regarded as the best all-round driver currently racing at the elite level of motorsport, a fact many of his peers are even happily willing to acknowledge.
The Spaniard -- a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the F1 driver market.
The 33-year-old made it clear he wanted to leave Ferrari, even though he had two years left to run on his contract with the Italian team, but he has yet to confirm where he will go next.
A return to McLaren seems most likely, despite his acrimonious departure from the team after just a single season as Lewis Hamilton's teammate in 2007.
McLaren is about to embark on a new phase after reigniting its relationship with engine manufacturer Honda.
Alonso is expected to lead this new era at McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the Honda engine is going to be a success.
Keeping the media guessing about his future -- and maybe his future employers too -- seems to have provided Alonso with plenty of sport off track.
Speculation in the media has seen Alonso linked with buying the Lotus team, joining forces with German sports car specialists Audi and even ousting Nico Rosberg or Hamilton at Mercedes.
Alonso remained typically tight lipped about his future plans when he was questioned by the media at the Abu Dhabi season finale.
Has Vettel made the right decision ?
Vettel has endured his worst season at Red Bull in 2014, failing to win a race compared to three victories for his rookie teammate Daniel Ricciardo.
Since his full debut season for Toro Rosso in 2008, the German has won at least one race a year, not to mention winning four straight world championships between 2010 and 2013.
The 27-year-old is now hoping to succeed where Alonso failed at Ferrari by adding to his collection of world titles.
 The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true, Vettel said.
 When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honor to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari.
 I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen. 
Vettel will partner Kimi Raikkonen -- the last man to win a world title with Ferrari in 2007 -- in 2015 but there are no guarantees the car and its Ferrari engine will be any match for the might of Mercedes.
Who will drive for McLaren ?
McLaren has tried to dampen speculation over just who will be in its cars in 2015 in the build-up to this weekend's season-ending race.
 We know you 're awaiting news on our driver line-up. We 'll announce after December 1 -- you 'll hear it here first, the team said on Twitter.
Alonso remains the red-hot favorite to take one of the seats but the future of current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen remains unclear.
Button -- the 2009 world champion with Brawn Grand Prix which has since morphed into Mercedes -- has remained sanguine about his future and has even explored the idea of moving to sports car racing.
Danish rookie Magnussen is fiercely passionate about staying with McLaren, the team which gave the 22-year-old his F1 debut in 2014.
 There is no Plan B, the Dane told CNN when asked if had explored his options if he was n't retained by the eight-time world champions.
Which other teams have seats to fill ?
Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus and Sauber have all confirmed their driver pairings for 2015. There are still seats on offer at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso.
Force India has already announced it will retain German Nico Hulkenberg for 2015 but Mexican Sergio Perez has not had his position with the team confirmed.
There's also only one seat up for grabs at Toro Rosso, who will blood 17-year-old Max Verstappen as the youngest F1 driver in history next season.
Junior Red Bull driver Carlos Sainz Jr is in pole position for the second seat -- and the Spaniard has been named as a test driver for Red Bull at the end of season test in Abu Dhabi -- although Toro Rosso may still retain French racer Jean-Eric Vergne.
Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr as its 2015 drivers in November much to the chagrin of current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for next season.
Ericsson and Nasr are both pay drivers, backed by sponsors who bring an estimated $30m funding to the Swiss team.
Grid shrinks to 18 in 2015 ?
The F1 market may be flooded with plenty of eager racers but the number of seats has been squeezed.
The financial pressures on the Caterham and Marussia teams, which both went into administration in October, means there are, in theory, only 18 spots on the F1 grid in 2015.
After missing the U.S. and Brazil grands prix, Caterham has used crowdfunding to help finance a return in Abu Dhabi.
Japan's Kamui Kobayashi retained his drive while the team has also handed Briton and former tester Will Stevens his F1 debut.
Both Caterham and Marussia remain on the official entry list for the 2015 season but their future is dependent on a hard winter drumming up funding to stay in the sport.
With teams spending a minimum of $70m per season, employing a driver who offers pace, performance and a pot of personal talent is more important than ever for those teams for ca n't afford super-talents like Alonso.

"The greatest boxer of the modern era is Muhammad Ali. There is generally no question about this in the boxing circles. However, there are those who would argue that there were others who were just as great. Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and was first called Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., but changed his name in the late 1960s after adopting Islam as his religion.
 
Ali was not only one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever to step into the ring, but also a deeply spiritual person who defied the United States government by standing on his ethics. He was a controversial and divisive man who elicited great emotion from those who loved him, and those who wanted him jailed.
Ali was on top of his profession in the late 60s when his draft classification was changed. He was ordered to enlist in the Army, but he refused. He claimed that he could not go to war because of his religious convictions. Many saw this move by the U.S. government as a way to silence the outspoken boxer because he was well beyond the age most young American men were being drafted at the time. Ali was stripped of his title, and was banned from boxing, while his case went through the U.S. court system. Ali was inactive during his ablest years from the age 25 to almost 29. There is no telling how many more victories and titles he could have won during his stolen prime.
Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8 - 0 decision in Ali's favor, overturning his conviction of draft evasion. His stance was not popular at the time among conservative Americans; many people disliked him very much, but his determination and moral principles held up his decision. He is now regarded as one of the most influential persons in the history of the U.S. He was named ""Sportsman of the Century"" by Sports Illustrated magazine, and ""Sports Personality of the Century"" by the BBC.",B2
"The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith. 
The man who has produced and worked with most of the western world's biggest music stars, from the Who, the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti, said the biggest problem was a dire lack of major new bands to succeed the old ones. 
""The festival circuit has peaked,"" he said, speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Powys, Wales. ""It really peaked about two years ago. There's too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them. That is a big, big problem in our industry. And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts - the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys - that can headline."" 
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. ""Music festivals have probably run their course. What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isn't just music but, like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra - not people standing around in a massive great field unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band."" 
Clearly, the way music is being delivered has changed, he said. ""People don't seem to want to listen to a body of work, an album, any more. And, most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work - they might take three albums to really hone their art, to become great, but young people don't want that. They home in on a track, a sound, then, ping, off again to the next one. Pop pervades, not that there's anything wrong with pop. I think it will come round again but it will take time."" 
Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Who's 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, which is due to be finished in time for the first stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016. 
De Levita would, said Goldsmith, be bringing his experimental SceneAround concept to London - theatre that puts the audience seating on a turntable that rotates round a series of scenes built around its circumference, accompanied by projections on panel screens. The concept was pioneered in an aircraft hangar outside Amsterdam and has proved hugely successful. 
Goldsmith, who is already planning to bring a production of the Anne Frank story to the as-yet-unnamed venue, said: ""It's a whole completely different way of producing shows."" 
During his Hay appearance, the impresario also revealed some of the ""access-all-areas"" secrets from his long career in the music industry, talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet in an effort to unblock it and witnessing the paralysing stage fright that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led to him being dragged, vomiting, out of his dressing room and shoved out on stage. ""It's the most bizarre thing, really, how common that is among artists. It's odd how stricken with fear they'll get but, as soon as the first chord is hit, they're fine,"" he said. 
He also laid to rest a long-running rock'n' roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America. Presley's long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him over tea, he said, that the real reason why Goldsmith's attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parker's own uncertain immigration status. 
""He explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant. He didn't want to risk leaving the US - it was him, not Elvis,"" said Goldsmith. 
And, his ultimate rock'n' roll performer? ""Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer we've ever had. At Live Aid, he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it."" 
But, the next Queen was still far from being formed, he said. ""We're not producing a new generation of this kind of act. Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago. There isn't much out there that looks like it is forming the next generation of heritage artists. 
""So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. Glastonbury has got to the point where it can't find any more big acts and that's the pinnacle of the festivals. They are really over.""

"The graph illustrates trends in music buying habits between 2011 and 2018. It presents three different methods: streaming, downloading and buying CDs.
Overall, both downloads and physical sales of music have steadily declined. The latter has slumped since 2011, while the downturn for the former began in 2014. However, there has been a sharp rise in people streaming music since 2013.
In 2011, the majority of music sales were of CDs, at 55% of all sales. In contrast, streaming was not common at all at only 5%. Also, although people had started to download music, it only represented 35% of sales. As sales of CDs began to fall, downloads started to rise. They rose steadily and downloads overtook physical sales in mid-2013. During the same period, streaming doubled to 10% but then it started to grow more dramatically.
Downloads peaked in 2014 at about 43% of sales but fell to 30% by 2018. This was slightly higher than physical sales, which shrank to 25%. Streaming, on the other hand, overtook both of them and accounted for just over 40% of sales in 2018.",B2
"Fashion during recession
Current economic trends present an opportunity
for many people to look at fashion in a way they
haven't before.
Many consumers are looking for fashion that is
not only affordable, but stylish as well. According
to some fashion experts, this has forced
designers and retailers to lose the excess fluff
and get back to the meat and potatoes of their
lines and offerings. That can mean clothes with
a better fit and designs that are more in tune
with their target markets, says Amanda Lovell,
department chair of Fashion Design at The Art
Institute of New York City.
""By making less and offering less, there is a
stronger focus on producing items that are
known sellers,"" Lovell says. ""Designers and
retailers need to get the most out of every
purchase a customer makes, due to the fact
that customers are thinking twice before buying
excess pieces.""
Each fashion brand, designer, and retailer has
items that are known sellers, Lovell explains. ""For
example, the Gap most likely sells their shortsleeve Crewneck or V-neck, black fitted T-shirts
for both men and women season after season
regardless of the economy or forces in the trend
cycle,"" she offers.
Designers also have responded by offering
lower-priced bridge lines, adds Mary Hall,
who provides money-saving tips on fashion,
dining out, and entertainment in her blog The
Recessionista.
""There are fewer and fewer high-end collections
with high prices coming out,"" says Hall, a Los
Angeles marketing manager. ""Now we have
Norma Kamali at Walmart, Vera Wang and
Dana Buchman at Kohl's, and the annual H&M
designers. It makes fashion so much more
accessible to consumers.""
And as fashion focuses on getting more bang for
the buck, shoppers are on the hunt for versatile
clothing items that have a long shelf life.
""We all just got a little wiser and started
exercising the power of the purse,"" Hall states.
""We are shopping smarter. The new differentiator
is value along with the best price.""
Lovell agrees. ""I believe from a consumer point
of view, they are looking for pieces to add to their
wardrobes that will take them further and have
more staying power,"" she offers. ""Classic pieces
have been trending well.""
To keep them looking up-to-date, many
designers just give them a slightly newer spin.
""Pieces such as the basic cardigan are receiving
a face-lift with added bobbles and trimmings and
simple touches in updating the buttons, or the
cut,"" Lovell comments. ""This is an example of a
classic piece that women can wear and depend
on year round. I see customers buying these
pieces that they can get more wear out of.""
Classic items aren't the only things popular in the
down economy. Many thrift stores are seeing a
boost in sales. According to a member survey by
the National Association of Resale & Thrift Shops,
slightly more than 64% of stores had an average
increase in sales of 31%.
Lovell also says there's a resurgence of people
mending their clothes and accessories before
replacing them with new items. ""For example,
shoe repair shops have noticed an increase in
business, as consumers bring in their shoes to be
repaired as opposed to purchasing a new pair,""
she explains.
""Overall, trends in consumer buying behaviors
change with what is going on socially, politically,
and economically in the world. The fashion
industry just needs to ride out this wave and
consumers will soon be spending in excess as
before,"" Lovell opines.
However, some say the recession has prompted
them to become more responsible in their
spending habits - a change that could be
permanent for many consumers.",B2
"Ryan Braun must now sit at home in shame. If press reports are accurate, Alex Rodriguez and about a dozen other Major League Baseball cheaters might do that too. But the homes they sit in are million-dollar mansions. That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal.
Sure, they look bad. But both Braun and Rodriguez have millions of dollars to fall back on. What's most troubling about this affair is how many of today's young people believe cheating might be the only way to break through in sports.
In a recent Zogby poll, nearly half of males ages 18 through 25 thought that taking performance-enhancing drugs is critical to making it in professional sports or helping one's athletic performance. And well more than half of those polled thought that at least one-third of the major leaguers in the recent All-Star Game had used performance-enhancing drugs, often called PEDs, to get where they are.
The problem is, for every Braun and A-Rod, a thousand young men will never make the majors -- but are willing to risk their health, even their lives, by taking PEDs. These young athletes need to hear more about Taylor Hooton than Ryan Braun.
Taylor Hooton was a star high school pitcher who turned to steroids to get to the next level. Although the steroids bulked up his body, they wreaked havoc on his emotions until one day he hanged himself. His father, Don Hooton, has committed his life to trying to help other young athletes steer clear of steroids.
Tragic decisions come when you combine motive with opportunity. That's what we have here. Young athletes see juiced-up athletes in a number of sports get fame and glory and multimillion contracts. They want to be like them. They can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other PEDs online.
They do n't have to find a shadowy figure lurking on a corner in a long overcoat. Teenagers know how to find just what they think they need on YouTube, eBay and other websites that parents have n't even heard of. But these children know nothing about the dangers of even the purest of steroids, not to mention those that are contaminated with dangerous substances. The Taylor Hooton Foundation has found PEDs that contain contaminants such as lead and other heavy metals, liquid mixers such as cooking oil, horse urine and other filthy contents.
What can parents do to keep their kids safe ?
Pay attention to sudden fluctuations in weight and muscle growth. If your son or daughter suddenly bulks up, it could be cause for concern. Additionally, pay attention to an extreme shift in personality. Teens are prone to mood shifts, but if suddenly your teen athlete is filled with unexplained rage, speak to him or her about what may be causing the extreme emotions.
It's also important to pay attention to Internet and credit card use. Many teenagers have credit cards, which can be easily used to purchase PEDs online. Recently, the consumer group I head, Digital Citizens Alliance, made four purchases online, and the illegal drugs arrived in just under a month.
Talk to your teenagers regularly about why they should n't be using PEDs. To use them is cheating, they are illegal to possess without a prescription, and they can do serious damage to teensbodies and their minds. It's a sad fact that if they play high school or college sports, these youths probably already know of someone who has taken PEDs. Do n't assume it's someone else's problem.
Most important, do n't ignore the warning signs, even if it leads to a tough conversation. Make sure young athletes hear the whole story.
Most of the media coverage around the MLB scandal is whether the PED use is worth the risk of millions of dollars in lost salary and the shame that comes with getting caught. But the real risk for young athletes is their health. The young athletes who appear to be our fit and finest could be facing decades of health trouble -- including liver abnormalities and tumors, increased risk for heart attacks, depression and more -- from taking PEDs.
Make sure that for every story about A-Rod, they hear about Taylor Hooton. Let them know that fame and money -- and the risk of shame -- are not what really is at stake here. When they use PEDs, they are risking their lives and their health. And that is never worth the risk.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Galvin.

"Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the most famous Americans ever. He was a pastor, and a humanitarian, but is known mostly for being a civil rights activist. King was the leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 60s. His use of non-violent protest to affect social change was based on his Christian beliefs. King was born Michael King, but his father changed his name in honor of the German reformer, Martin Luther.
 
King lived during the most divisive era in American history. The white and the southern culture in the United States wanted nothing to do with social change during the 60s. Segregation laws were in place that prohibited black Americans from eating at the same restaurants as whites, or to ride in the same section on public buses with white Americans. King led the famous 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott in reaction to Rosa Park's refusal to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger as was required by law in Montgomery, Alabama at the time.
King started his activism while serving as a Baptist minister for the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. He believed strongly in the Christian belief that loving thy neighbor as yourself, which was a philosophy he used throughout his civil rights years. He was also a great speaker. His ""I Have a Dream"" speech is regarded as one of the most famous oratory in American history. In it, he speaks of how his dream is for white and black Americans to walk together hand in hand as brothers. The speech also declared how it was his dream for all Americans to be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
On October 14, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in combating racial inequality in the United States. He was assassinated in April, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee at the age of 39.",B2
"Fernando Torreshighly-anticipated switch to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday transfer window closed in a deal that his former team Liverpool said had broken the British record.
Chelsea's website reported that the Spain striker had signed a five-and-a-half-year contract, but did not disclose the fee -- which British media speculated would be about # 50 million -LRB- $80 million -RRB-.
However, it was still well short of the world-record $130 million that Spain's Real Madrid paid English club Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.
In another deal confirmed late on Monday, Benfica said that Brazil defender David Luiz had joined Chelsea in a deal worth $34 million that saw Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic sign for the Portuguese club.
 I am very happy with my transfer to Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates this season and for many years to come, 2010 World Cup winner Torres told the London side's website.
 Having played against Chelsea many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place in the team. I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season. 
The 26-year-old scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League appearances for Liverpool after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2007 in a # 20 million deal, netting 81 in 142 games in all competitions.
Torresmove followed the news that Liverpool had agreed a club-record fee for Newcastle's England striker Andy Carroll, who handed in a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved bid.
Just before the 2300 GMT deadline, Liverpool confirmed that the 22-year-old had signed a contract until 2016. The fee was not disclosed but it reportedly surpassed the previous British record of # 33 million -LRB- $53 million -RRB- that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008.
Will deadline-day spending buck the trend ?
Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has been relatively quiet in transfer market for the past two seasons, but has this time backed coach Carlo Ancelotti with two marquee signings as his club languish fourth in the table -- 10 points behind leaders Manchester United.
The London team also announced on Monday that the Chelsea FC plc made a loss of # 70.9 million -LRB- $113 million -RRB- for the year ended June 30, 2010.
 The reduction in operating losses and increased sales in 2009-10 shows that we are moving in the right direction especially when viewed against the difficult macroeconomic environment, chief executive Ron Gourlay told Chelsea's website.
 The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA financial fair playinitiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013. 
Latest transfer rumors on Twitter
Carroll joined Uruguay World Cup striker Luis Suarez at Liverpool, with the 24-year-old completing his $36 million transfer from Dutch club Ajax earlier on Monday to become Kenny Dalglish's first major signing in his second stint as manager.
The 24-year-old has scored 111 goals in 159 games for the Amsterdam side.
Another high-profile striker on the move Monday was Tottenham's Robbie Keane, who has agreed a loan switch to London rivals West Ham until the end of this season.
The move is likely to become permanent should the Hammers, currently bottom of the EPL, avoid relegation to the second flight.
Blog: Who will be the best signing of the transfer window ?
Manager Avram Grant said after the 3-2 FA Cup win Nottingham Forest that he hoped the Republic of Ireland international would provide the spark to get the club away from the drop zone.
 He is not just a good player, he is a good character that we need in the next 14 games, the Israeli told the UK Press Association.
Tottenham, who face AC Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, were linked with a bid for Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero.
But the Argentina striker has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract extension with the Spanish side until 2014 and told the La Liga outfit's official website: I 'm staying here because I want to. 
Spurs manager Harry Redknapp would not confirm his interest in Aguero or other reported targets in Spain as he arrived for Monday's training session, but told Sky Sports that former England defender Jonathan Woodgate would not be leaving on loan.
Woodgate, who has returned to fitness after long-term injury, is needed as defensive cover after captain Michael Dawson was banned for three matches after being sent off in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat to Fulham, while French fellow center-back Younes Kaboul needs an operation, said Redknapp.
United States international midfielder Michael Bradley has joined English club Aston Villa from German side Borussia Monchengladbach on loan until the end of this season.
Villa boss Gerard Houllier told reporters: We 've got to prepare for the future and Michael is 23 and a very hard-working midfielder who can score goals. 
Villa allowed Irish midfielder Stephen Ireland to join Newcastle on loan for the rest of this season, almost six months after he arrived from Manchester City.
Houllier also said that the club had received no bids for England winger Ashley Young.
Turkey international striker Tuncay Sanli has moved from English Premier League side Stoke to Wolfsburg in a $7 million deal, the German club announced on their official website.
The Bundesliga side also announced the arrival of attacking midfielders Koo Ja-Cheoul of South Korea and Venezuelan Yohandry Orozco, plus Bayer Leverkusen's Germany international striker Patrick Helmes and Czech midfielder Jan Polak.
The 21-year-old Koo -- who scored five goals in six matches at the recent Asian Cup -- signed a three-and-a-half-year deal from Korean side Jeju United, while 19-year-old Orozco signed from Venezuela's Zulia FC until 2015.
Stoke also allowed former Chelsea and Barcelona striker Eidur Gudjohnsen to join English rivals Fulham on loan, with the Iceland international having failed to win a regular place since his pre-season move from Monaco.
German rivals Schalke signed Iran international midfielder Ali Karimi, who worked with coach Felix Magath when they were both at Bayern Munich, plus clubless Greece striker Angelos Charisteas -- who scored the winning goal in the final of Euro 2004.
Serie A leaders AC Milan confirmed on their website the signing of 34-year-old Italy defender Nicola Legrottaglie from league rivals Juventus, on a contract until June this year.
Italian champions Inter Milan have signed Japan leftback Yuto Nagamoto on loan from Cesena on loan for the rest of this season, with 20-year-old Italy international defender Davide Santon moving in the opposite direction.
The 24-year-old Nagamoto set up the only goal of the Asian Cup final against Australia on Saturday which sealed a record fourth title for the Blue Samurai.
Inter coach Leonardo has allowed Colombian defender Nelson Rivas to join Ukrainian side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on loan, with a view to a permanent deal.
Brazil-born Italy international striker Amauri has returned to Parma on loan from Italian rivals Juventus, who have replaced him with Cagliari's Alessandro Matri.
English club Birmingham City signed Nigeria international Obafemi Martins in a six-month loan deal from Russian side Rubin Kazan, after the former Newcastle striker was granted a work permit.
Portugal international striker Liedson has returned to the country of his birth after joining Brazilian club Corinthians from Sporting Lisbon in a $2.9 million deal.
The 32-year-old qualified for Portuguese nationality in 2009 and played for his adopted nation at last year's World Cup finals in South Africa.
Ecuador midfielder Jefferson Montero has swapped Spanish clubs after joining struggling Levante from Champions League hopefuls Villarreal on loan.
Dutch club Feyenoord have signed Denmark international striker Soren Larsen from French side Toulouse on loan for the rest of this season, along with Arsenal's new 18-year-old Japanese forward Ryo Miyaichi and Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Marcel Meeuwis.

"Born in the small town of Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Aaron Presley grew up in poverty. His working-class parents moved frequently throughout the state, going from job to job. Presley grew to be one of the most recognizable and famous American celebrities the country has ever known. He recorded countless records, starred on the big screen, and his songs were heard on the radio by more fans than any other artists in history.
 
Presley received his first guitar at the age of 10, and soon began a musical career that would last more than 25 years. His first success was winning a high school talent contest in Memphis, Tennessee, while still in school. Shortly after graduation, Presley was discovered by Sam Phillips, a record company owner. His first commercial success came in 1954 with his hit single That's all Right. Much of Presley's success could be attributed to his unconventional dance, and live performance style. His hip movements and sexually-suggestive moves earned Presley much praise, and controversy.
In 1956, Presley recorded his first No. 1 hit Heartbreak Hotel, and his first No. 1 album, the self-titled Elvis Presley. He also signed a contract with Paramount Pictures Studios, which was, and is still, one of the biggest Hollywood studios in the industry. He went on to star in several movies with Paramount. In 1957, Presley was drafted into service by the United States Army, where he served overseas. His time in the military did not hurt his career. Soon after his service was over in 1960, Presley began recording music, and starring in films.
Presley married in 1967, and had a daughter the following year. Sadly, his marriage ended in divorce in 1973. He fell into prescription drug abuse, and put on a great deal of weight. He died in August, 1977, resulting from complications of his drug abuse. He still remains one of the most profitable artists in the world today.",B2
"1. On the 21st June 1986 - the date of the summer solstice - Larry Harvey and Jerry
James invited a few friends to Baker Beach in San Francisco to celebrate the longest
day of the year. They marked the event by setting fire to a nine foot wooden model
of a man and a dog. As they watched the flames consume the crudely made figures,
none of them could have known how their small gathering would grow over the next
two decades and develop into an annual seven day experience that has become
known simply as Burning Man. In 2011, so many people wanted to be part of it that
the number of participants had to be limited to 50,000.
2. Even the organisers of the Burning Man project find it difficult to describe the
experience. 'Trying to explain what Burning Man is to someone who has never been
to the event,' says their official website, 'is a bit like trying to explain what a particular
colour looks like to someone who is blind.' Part celebration, part act of rebellion,
part community theatre, the week long event - now held in the Black Rock Desert
of Nevada - attracts tens of thousands of people. They still come to watch the ritual
destruction of a wooden figure (now more than forty feet high), but most of all they
come to take part in a series of spontaneous 'happenings' and to create a temporary
community of like-minded people.
3. Larry Harvey, one of the founding members, is now executive director and has
become the project's official spokesperson. Famous for his grey cowboy hat, which
he wears in memory of his father, he has become a familiar figure in the media,
featuring on television news reports and in newspaper and magazine articles that
appear as regularly as the Burning Man festival itself. The success and the scale of
the Burning Man owe a great deal to Larry Harvey's imagination and sense of vision.
4. Burning Man is often called a phenomenon of the 'Internet Generation' and,
like social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, the festival encourages
the notions of community participation and self-expression. The event is governed
by ten principles which emphasise the key beliefs of self-reliance and communal
responsibility. People are encouraged to take part in the events and - by working with
and helping each other - to discover something about themselves.
5. Although the event takes place in a harsh desert environment, all participants -
called 'burners' - are expected to be able to fend for themselves over the seven day
period. The organisers do not provide meals or accommodation and there are no
conventional shops to buy food at or hotels to sleep in. In fact, Burning Man has its
own distinct economy based on the concept of gift-giving, and the use of money is
forbidden.
6. Burners are encouraged to express themselves artistically through painting,
music, dance, performance and other forms of creativity. Each year Larry Harvey
announces a theme for the event to provide them with inspiration - in the year 2006,
for example, it was 'Hope and Fear'. The theme influences almost everything about
the event - from the clothes the people wear to the vehicles they travel around in.
In keeping with the original idea many of the art exhibits and events revolve around
fire, and specially constructed platforms are erected to ensure that all acts of burning
are done safely.
7. For the duration of the event the burners make their home in a self-built community
called Black Rock City, which regular attendees abbreviate to the letters BRC. The
city is always arranged in a distinctive semi-circular pattern, but its street names differ
from year to year in keeping with the changing theme. Just as it seems to appear
miraculously in the desert, the city disappears with equal suddenness. Following the
principle of 'Leave No Trace', the participants dismantle the temporary structures
that they built for shelter and take them away together with all their litter as they
depart, leaving the desert in the same condition that they found it. Once Burning Man
is over for the year, it is as if it never took place at all.",B2
"The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a son on Monday, 22 July. Third in line to the throne, the baby is destined to be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the English crown in 1066. 
Kensington Palace announced at 8.30pm that the baby was born at 4.24pm in the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, West London. ""We could not be happier,"" the Duke of Cambridge said. 
In a statement, Kensington Palace said: ""Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 4.24pm. The baby weighs 8lbs 6oz. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth."" The duchess experienced at least ten and a half hours' labour, which Kensington Palace said had ""progressed as normal"". 
The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families were informed and were delighted with the news that Her Royal Highness and her child were both doing well. 
It is understood that the couple delayed making the announcement immediately so that they could enjoy some private time with their newborn. William telephoned his family to tell them the good news, speaking to the Queen, his father, Charles and younger brother, Prince Harry. 
The birth of the baby prince means the monarchy has three generations of heirs to the throne for the first time since 1894. 
The baby is the first Prince of Cambridge to be born for more than 190 years since Prince George of Cambridge, a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge. 
In a statement, Prince Charles said: ""Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild. It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy. 
""Grandparenthood is a unique moment in anyone's life, as countless kind people have told me in recent months, so I am enormously proud and happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing the baby in the near future."" 
The newest royal will be called HRH Prince George of Cambridge. When Kate was three months pregnant, a decree issued by the Queen said: ""All the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour."" 
Following tradition, a formal notice was posted on an ornate rococo-style easel - the same used to announce Prince William's birth in 1982 - in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9pm. Within an hour, the numbers had swelled from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists alike keen to share in the historic moment. 
New Yorker, Sharon Surloff, was delighted with her phone picture of the royal bulletin, snapped after she and her niece and mother had squeezed through crowds to take a photograph of the easel. 
""The police were just saying to everyone: 'OK, 20 seconds and then the next person'. It's just great to be here, though. We arrived this morning, at nine in the morning, so it has all worked out beautifully."" 
The palace announced the birth in a press release. Minutes later, as crowds of well- wishers outside cheered, ""It's a boy"", the formal medical bulletin was taken from the hospital to a waiting car by Ed Perkins, Prince William's press secretary. He handed it to a soldier, who then took the notice, which was signed by Marcus Setchell, the Queen's gynaecologist, to Buckingham Palace under police escort. 
The prime minister was one of the first to offer his congratulations. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""It is wonderful news from St Mary's, Paddington, and I am sure that, right across the country, and, indeed, right across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well. 
""It is an important moment in the life of our nation but, I suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy. It has been a remarkable few years for our royal family: a royal wedding that captured people's hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service."" 
Congratulations came from the White House, too, from Barack Obama and his wife. The president said: ""Michelle and I are so pleased to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the joyous occasion of the birth of their first child. We wish them all the happiness and blessings parenthood brings."" 
The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, tweeted: ""Delighted for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. May God bless them all with love, health and happiness."" 
The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said: ""Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I wish them and their son all happiness and good health."" 
The campaign group, Republic, which launched its Born Equal initiative calling for every child to be born equal in political status and rights, said the royal birth raised questions about Britain and democratic values. Chief Executive Graham Smith said the baby should be able to grow up without ""constant interference and intrusion"". He said: ""Here is a new baby whose career, religion, even personal relationships have already been mapped out. Meanwhile, this is an opportunity for the rest of us to consider whether this circus is the best way to run things.""

"It was rush hour on a Tuesday, and Dorothy Otto was sitting in traffic in her Pontiac Bonneville on the lower level of the Cypress Freeway, in Oakland, California, when the voice on the radio said, We 're having an earthquake. 
Suddenly, the concrete around her began to ripple.
There was a giant crash, and a large, heavy beam dropped on the front of her car, crushing the engine, barely missing her face. The car dropped 20 feet, and when it settled, Otto's left foot was trapped.
The double-decker freeway had collapsed, pinning motorists in their cars.
Otto found a pen and decided to write a note to her husband, just in case.
 Jack, earthquake hit while I was under concrete, worst happened, she wrote. It collapsed on car. I 'm alive, just my left foot is stuck under the car. Hope they do n't kill me getting me out. Love you lots, good luck to us both. 
Firefighter Lorenzo Frediani was running out of time as he struggled to free Otto's foot and get her to safety. Each aftershock lowered the upper deck, bringing it closer to crushing Otto and Frediani. Then, Frediani was able to nudge the crushed dashboard just enough. Otto was free.
Her section of the Cypress collapsed 20 minutes later.
That was October 17, 1989. The magnitude 6.9 earthquake, now called Loma Prieta, killed 63 people, 42 of them on the Cypress freeway. The quake caused $10 billion in damage, ultimately inspiring California and the rest of the region to re-examine their safety measures for earthquakes.
Nearby Oregon sits on a huge fault line that separates two of the Earth's tectonic plates. One plate lies beneath the Pacific Ocean, off Oregon's coast, and it is being shoved beneath the North American continent, according to Ian Madin, a geologist and chief scientist at Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries.
Are earthquakes on the rise ?
The fault line, known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, could one day cause an even larger quake.
 As the two plates collide, Madin says, the fault gets stuck, eventually slipping when enough stress builds up to produce a great earthquake. 
With ultra-accurate GPS, Madin says scientists know that the collision is still going on because they can measure the movement. Oregon actually moves about 1A 1/2 inches every year, typical for a region near a subduction zone.
These megaquakes can cause strong shaking over large areas for several minutes. They can also lead to landslides, tsunamis and widespread liquefaction, turning soil to soup.
After the deadly 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011, Oregon legislators commissioned a study on the impact a comparable quake could have on the state. Madin was one of the authors of the Oregon Resilience Plan, which is aimed at reducing risk and improving recovery for the next Cascadia earthquake and tsunami.
Oregon is not prepared for a megaquake, and few areas are, Madin says. He says Japan is the most prepared, and look at the results of their megaquake. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami resulted in more than 15,000 deaths.
Before 1974, there were no specific building requirements in Oregon to make sure structures were built to withstand major quakes, and design codes have only been adequate for the megaquake since 1993, so many structures are not designed to resist such a large earthquake, Madin says.
Earthquake fast facts
 On top of that, we have a lot of mountainous terrain that is highly susceptible to landslides, large areas that are susceptible to liquefaction, and 300 miles of coast that will be inundated by tsunamis that will arrive within 15 to 20 minutes of the earthquake and may locally reach elevations of 100 feet above sea level, he says.
It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worst-case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewer for several months to several years. The damage could result in $30 billion in economic losses. Madin says $30 billion is almost certainly an underestimate, and death estimates could also be off.
Based on the study of geologic features that record prehistoric earthquakes, scientists generally agree that there have been 42 megaquakes along the Cascadia fault in the last 10,000 years, with the most recent in January 1700.
Using historic data, scientists like Dr. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University, can forecast the probability of another great quake.
The Cascadia Subduction Zone is actually made up of different clusters, according to Goldfinger. On the south end of the fault, the data shows that an earthquake with a magnitude between the high sevens and low eights occurs every 250 years.
 We 're 300 years into a 240 year cycle, says Goldfinger.
On the other hand, the north end, with the great population centers, sees a big event closer to every 500 years.
But before Oregonians panic, consider Goldfinger's assessment of the statistics. For the south end of the Cascadia, there is roughly a 35-40 % probability of having a major quake in the next 50 years. On the north end, there is only a 10-15 % probability.
Even if there is still plenty of time before the next big quake, much work has to be done to make sure Oregon is ready.
 The most important thing is to strengthen or replace infrastructure to make sure that our lifeline systems like power and water will not be so severely damaged that they require years to repair. We also need to strengthen or replace critical facilities like hospitals, fire and police facilities and schools, says Madin.
Following on the release of the Oregon Resilience Plan, the Oregon Legislature established a task force to come up with specific recommendations for action for the 2015 legislative session.
Oregon has already turned a corner because institutions are no longer asking, Why should I do anything to prepare and are now asking, How do I pay for the preparation I know I need ?

"Columbus Day is observed on the second Monday of October in the United States, and in some other countries around the world. For a long time it was observed on a specific date, October 12. It is named after Christopher Columbus, the Italian sailor who led three Spanish ships to claim new lands in 1492. There is even a child's poem remembering the date. It reads, ""In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue"". Some people say Columbus ""discovered"" North America, although not everyone agrees with this interpretation. For example, Columbus never landed on North America proper. He only got as far as to the islands in the Caribbean Sea.
 
Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937; government offices, schools, and post offices are closed. Many Italians take the day as a day to celebrate their own ethnic heritage since Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy. Columbus's explorations, however, were conducted in the name of Spain. Major cities, like New York City and San Francisco, host large parades. Some cities, like New York City, also hold a parade celebrating the Hispanic or Latino community.
Not everyone thinks Christopher Columbus should be honored. Some states like South Dakota do not observe the holiday at all. Instead they call the day Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples Day. In Hawaii the holiday is also known as Landing Day or Discoverer's Day. This is because European arrival in North America meant the loss of land and lives for many Native people. Many people hold protests or vigils on this day to remember the Native Americans that were killed or enslaved as a result of the European arrival. Another name for the holiday is ""Dia de la Raza"" which translates into English as Day of the Race.",B2
"Johnny Carson served as host for the iconic, late-night television series The Tonight Show for 30 years. During that time, Carson entertained generations of American television viewers with his down-to-earth style, casual approach, and quick-witted humor. The Tonight Show was already a big success when Carson took over from the retiring Jack Paar, but Carson took the show to the next level. His style, and grace on camera has been mimicked by many late-night talk show hosts, who have credited Carson as their mentor.
 
Carson was born thousands of miles away from the glitz of New York, and Los Angeles, in the city of Corning, Iowa, in 1925. Carson began his entertainment career at the age of 14 when he appeared at county fairs as a magician, which was his first love. His family moved to the state of Nebraska when Carson was a young man, and he served as a communications officer for the U.S. Navy during the tail end of World War II. His broadcast career began in 1950 in Omaha, Nebraska before moving to Los Angeles, and landing a job with a local television station.
Carson officially became host of The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. The show was based in New York City until 1972 when, at Carson's request, the show was permanently moved to the Los Angeles area. Carson hosted his show in Burbank for the next 21 years, where he perfected his style and approach to his guests. It was considered an honor to be invited to The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.
Carson was a true entertainer. He performed many skits during his reign, where he dressed up in costume, and played ridiculous characters, which is something today's late-night hosts do not do. Carson was never afraid to laugh at himself.z",B2
"Dear Professor Henley,
I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I am unable to continue to attend the Logic II course this semester. I would like to request permission to defer as I understand that this is only possible with your approval.
The issue is that I am currently doing an internship with ABC Ltd. It started in July and will continue until the end of the semester. The internship takes up 25 hours per week and I am concerned that it does not leave me with enough time to study. I have already asked if I can reduce my hours there, but this is not possible.
With your approval, I could take Logic II next semester instead. I realise that this would mean a heavier workload than usual next semester, but I assure you that I would be able to manage my time and keep up.
Thank you for considering my request and I would be happy to come in and discuss the matter further.

"Being controversial is a right every American has, and William 'Bill' Maher uses that right about as well as any other person in the country. Maher is an actor, comedian, political satirist, and talk show host. He was born in New York City in 1958 into a Roman Catholic family, but today he calls himself an agnostic. One of the first instances where Maher questioned Catholicism was when his father stopped taking him and his sister when he was 13. He discovered his father was angry at the church because of their stance against birth control. His father has become an outspoken person against all organized religions ever since.
 
Maher is currently the host of the HBO show ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" It is a highly-rated, late night show that has received many Emmy nominations for excellence. It is a controversial show where emotions run high between Maher and his guests. Maher speaks his mind, and this has been a source of trouble over the years, but it has also earned him praise.
In 2001, Maher came under criticism for his comments about the terrorist attacks on the United States in September of that year. President George W. Bush had publicly called the attackers ""cowards,"" to which Maher took exception. Maher stated on his show that the real cowards were the Americans. ""We have been the cowards,"" said Maher. ""Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away; that's cowardly."" He later said he was not criticizing the American military, but only pointing out that America plays a large role in Middle East politics.
Maher has also made enemies among religious organizations. He says he dislikes religion, which he calls an unnecessary bureaucracy between people and God. He was once very liberal about every religion, but has changed his views on Islam saying he knows of no other religion that calls for the death of anyone who criticizes their religion. He has also called the Mormon church ridiculous.",B2

"Anna woke up late one morning. She was supposed to meet up with a group of friends that morning at 8 o'clock. She woke up at 8:15 instead. Anna rushed to get ready. She quickly showered, put on her clothes. Then, she grabbed her tool box and headed out on her bike.
 
Anna and her friends were asked to paint two murals for the city's library. One of the murals was to be located on the outside, and the other on the inside. The owner of the library was the one who requested these murals. The reason was because he was a fan of Anna's art, and was planning to remodel the library.
Both murals were going to be painted with a similar theme. They were both going to be paintings aimed to inspire people to read. Anna already had her ideas for both murals planned out. It was going to be colorful. Her friends were going be there to help paint the large areas of the mural.
Once Anna arrived, she noticed her friends waiting outside the library. Anna apologized for being late. She pulled out her ideas to show to her friends. Her friends were impressed and excited to begin painting. They first started by outlining the images of the ideas onto both walls. Next, they mixed their colors and began to paint. Painting the mural was a lot faster to do when you have the help of your friends. They finished both murals within two days.
The new murals attracted the attention of local visitors to the library. The owner of the library was impressed and happy with the new look of his library. He awarded Anna and her friends with recognition and paid them for their labor. Anna was pleased.",B2
"Two mothers in South Africa have discovered they are raising each other's daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010. 
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and reclaim her biological child, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own, posing a huge legal dilemma. 
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, who cannot be identified because of a court order, described the inadvertent swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending. 
Both mothers gave birth at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, on the same day in 2010. ""Nobody suspected anything,"" Strydom said. 
But, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter. Strydom continued: ""The man denied he was the father. A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby. She was devastated. She didn't know what to do."" 
Eventually, she met the other mother and, since December 2013, they have been attending joint counselling sessions, arranged by the hospital. This has included meeting their biological daughters. 
Strydom said of his client: ""She said there are resemblances to herself. She conveyed to me that it was traumatic. You can see it's not easy for her. She has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else."" 
The woman reportedly became unhappy with the process and approached the children's court in a bid to gain custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused. Strydom agreed to represent the woman, who has one elder child, pro bono. 
""It's a tragedy. She wants the baby back but it seems the other mother is reluctant. It's four years later: you can understand she doesn't want to give up her baby."" 
The High Court in Pretoria has appointed the University of Pretoria's Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children, which is the guiding principle under South African law. It must report back within 90 days. 
Strydom added: ""Your guess is as good as mine what the court may decide. It's a travesty. How do you rectify it after four years? The longer you wait, the more traumatic it will be. But, whatever happens, someone won't be happy."" 
He said at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is currently helping with the case and providing counselling. 
The Centre for Child Law will now interview the mothers and fathers, as well as any other person with a ""significant relationship"" with either of the girls. The children and mothers will undergo ""full and thorough"" clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist. 
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said ""What's going to happen must be in the best interests of the children. Biology is an important aspect but not the only one."" 
The families are of Zulu ethnicity and so Zulu tradition, culture and customary law will be a factor, she added. It is also still possible the ex- partner of the mother taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was switched. 
It is not the first child-swap case to come to light in South Africa. In 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born. 
In 2009, in Oregon in the United States, Dee Ann Angell and Kay Rene Reed discovered that they had been mistakenly mixed up at birth in 1953 when a nurse brought them back from bathing. In 2013, in Japan, a 60-year-old man swapped at birth from his rich parents to a poor family was given compensation. He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological siblings - and the boy brought up in his place - attended private secondary schools and universities. 
Bruce Laing, a clinical psychologist in Johannesburg, said the long-term effects of a baby swap could be ""profound"", ""terrifying"" and ""incredibly traumatizing"". He told The Times of South Africa: ""An increasingly complicated situation is that some resentment towards a child that is not yours might occur. The parents might always be thinking 'What if?'""

"A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows.
Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center.
Police also released two audio recordings Wednesday -- a 911 call preceding the shooting and a tape of a dispatcher asking officers to go to the park.
The shooting happened after a person called 911 to report that a black male -- probably a juvenile -- was pointing a pistol at people outside the recreation center. Twice the caller said the gun might be fake.
The dispatcher radioed to officers about a black male who was pointing a gun at people, but did not mention that caller's belief that he could be a minor and that the gun might not be a real firearm, one of the released recordings shows.
Police previously said it was n't clear if the responding officers received the information about the suspect's age or the gun possibly being fake.
Authorities are investigating the shooting, and the two officers -- identified Wednesday by police as Timothy Loehmann, 26, and Frank Garmback, 46 -- are on leave from their jobs.
Loehmann joined the department in March, Tomba said.
Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba stressed that his department released the video at the request of Tamir's relatives, who had seen it privately with authoritiespermission.
 We are honoring the wishes of the family, Tomba said. ... This is an obvious tragic event. 
In a written statement obtained by CNN affiliate WEWS, the family thanked the police for making the video public.
 It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us, the family said. We ask for the community to remain calm. Please protest peacefully and responsibly. Your prayers, kind words and condolences have meant so much to us.
Video shows officer shoot Tamir
The video shows Tamir walking along a sidewalk and eventually sitting on a picnic table bench under a gazebo Saturday afternoon, sometimes pointing what appears to be a handgun.
Eventually, Tamir emerges from the bench and walks to the edge of the gazebo. A police car drives up to the gazebo, leaving the road and rolling over snowy grass to do so.
One of the officers -- the one in the passenger seat -- told Tamir three times to show your hands, Tomba told reporters.
 -LRB- The officer's -RRB- door was open as they pulled up, Tomba said. He yelled three times as they pulled up. 
The eight-minute surveillance video has no audio.
Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon. The video shows Loehmann, the passenger-side officer, exiting the car, and Tamir falls down, apparently shot.
Between 1.5 to two seconds elapsed from the time the car pulled up to the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said. At that point, only the passenger-side officer was out of the car, the video shows.
One of the officers, radioing to dispatch, reported that a black male, maybe 20, was down, according to the released radio traffic between the officers and dispatchers.
The driver was Garmback, a six-year veteran of the force, according to Tomba.
Chief Calvin Williams said that four minutes after Tamir was shot a detective and FBI agent were on the scene. The FBI agent began first aid and paramedics arrived three minutes later.
Investigators determined that Tamir's weapon was an air gun, and that an orange tip that is meant to indicate that it's not a real firearm had been removed, police said.

"Bill Gates is an American inventor, computer programmer, philanthropist, and businessman, who was born in Seattle, Washington. He is reportedly worth nearly $80 billion, making him one of the wealthiest people in the country. He founded, and was head of Microsoft Corporation for years, and is still on the board for the computer software giant.
 
Gates was born to an upper-middle class family. His father was an attorney; his mother was a banker, who worked for the United Way for many years. He is credited for being the father of the modern computer, and for almost single-handedly starting the personal computer revolution. He studied at Harvard University, but did not graduate because of his desire to develop new software.
As a 13-year-old student at the Lakeside School, which was an exclusive college preparatory school, Gates was introduced to computer programming. That year he developed a program that allowed users to play tic-tac-toe against the computer. Gates was reportedly fascinated by the computer's ability to reproduce software code. In 1975, Gates approached a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). He convinced the owner that he had written a program that would work with his platform. The owner of the company bought into Gates innovations, and the two men reached an agreement to develop software for MITS. The Microsoft Company was born.
Gates went on to develop the Windows operating system with then partner IBM Corporation. The two companies had differences though, and their partnership ended quickly. Gates left Microsoft in 2000, but remains on its board of directors. He remained active with the company for several years before stepping down in February 2014, becoming Technical Advisor for the firm.",B2
"Halloween is on October 31. It is also called All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve. This is because, according to some, the holiday has its roots in a Christian holiday that remembers the dead. Others say the holiday has its roots in the ancient harvest season traditions of Ireland. In the U.S. though, the focus is less on memories of the dearly departed or agriculture. It is about kids dressing up in scary costumes and going door-to-door asking for candy. This is called trick-or-treating. When children knock on the door of a house or ring the doorbell, they usually say ""Trick or Treat"". The ""trick"" part is a fake threat signaling that the kids will commit a prank if they aren't given something delicious. Homeowners then give the children candy, raisins, or some other food treat. Many homeowners decorate their houses to prepare for the holiday and let kids know that they are participating and can ring the bell for candy. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are pumpkins with faces carved into them and candles inside. Jack-o' lanterns were thought to scare away evil spirits when Halloween was first celebrated among the ancient Christians. Also turnips, not pumpkins, were originally used. People often decorate using the colors black and orange.
 
Halloween is not just for kids; adults get in on the fun by attending costume parties. There are often contests for who has the best costume. There are also games bobbing for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a large bucket of water. Other people celebrate by scaring themselves by going to haunted houses, homes where people dressed up as ghosts, zombies, and werewolves and jump out to frighten guests. People also tell scary stories or watch horror movies.",B2

"Scarlett Johansson is suing a French novelist for EUR50,000 in damages, alleging that his work of fiction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life. 
La Premiere chose qu'on regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gregoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the book's lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself. In the novel, the model's looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her. She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and, in the end, dies in a car crash. 
Johansson herself is not flattered by the best- selling literary work. Her lawyer, Vincent Toledano, told Le Figaro that Delacourt's novel constituted a ""violation and fraudulent and illegal exploitation of her name, her reputation and her image."" He said the novel contains ""defamatory claims about her private life"" and has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema. The court case began in Paris on Wednesday afternoon, though neither Johansson nor Delacourt was present. 
""The freedom of expression that she defends as an artist is not in question,"" Toledano said. ""Such activities for purely mercantile ends have nothing to do with creativity."" 
Delacourt has tried explaining that he chose to reference Johansson because she is ""the archetype of beauty today."" He said: ""I wrote a work of fiction. My character is not Scarlett Johansson."" 
The author recently hit out against the actor on French radio, saying the legal action was ""rather sad"". He said: ""It freaks me out to think that, when you talk of a character in a novel, judges can get involved."" 
Delacourt has become one of France's best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a film. But he said he was ""speechless"" when he found out Johansson was suing him. 
""I thought she'd get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her. I didn't write a novel about a celebrity,"" he said. ""I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty, especially interior beauty. 
""If an author can no longer mention the things that surround us - a brand of beer, a monument, an actor - it's going to be complicated to produce fiction. 
""It's stupefying, especially as I'm not sure she's even read the novel, since it hasn't been translated yet."" 
Emmanuelle Allibert, spokeswoman for publisher JC Lattes, said taking legal action was ""crazy"". ""We have never known anything like it. It is all the more surprising for the fact that the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson. It is about a woman who is Scarlett Johansson's double."" 
Delacourt's lawyer, Anne Veil, who is also representing publisher JC Lattes, said the allegations were ""totally scandalous"". ""This is a literary, not commercial, approach. She has not been used as a product,"" she said. ""Gregoire Delacourt is not a paparazzo; he's a writer!"" 
Ironically, the author's legal situation would be far easier had he published the book in Johansson's home country, rather than France. Lloyd Jassin, a New York intellectual property lawyer, told Time that the case would be unlikely to be considered in the United States because the book would be protected by the First Amendment. 
""The First Amendment doesn't look at most books as commercial uses or commercial propositions,"" he said. ""If her name or likeness is relevant, literarily, if there's significance and literary merit to using her name between the covers, the First Amendment steps in."" However, in France, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken ""much more seriously,"" Jassin says. 
""I thought she might send me flowers as it was a declaration of love for her, but she didn't understand,"" Delacourt said. ""It's a strange paradox - but a very American one.""

"Indignant waiters are calling for public support in a battle to hold on to their tips. PizzaExpress branches are to be targeted by protesters as part of an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop creaming off a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will back their demands. 
In a policy that has outraged some employees, PizzaExpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every GBP1 paid when tips are given by card. The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes an estimated GBP1m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite. 
""We believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers,"" said Chantal Chegrinec, campaigns officer at Unite. ""We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are by no means the only offender and we will be turning our attention to other companies after this."" 
The protests are being organized by local branches of Unite, with the first taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London. The union has also written to the restaurant chain's CEO, Richard Hodgson. Unite began the campaign following a survey of its PizzaExpress members after the chain was sold to a Chinese private equity firm, Hony Capital, in 2014. One of the top issues was the 8% deduction from their tips. 
One disgruntled PizzaExpress employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said that the admin fee was costing her GBP3 a night. ""I have worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years,"" she said in a letter to Unite. ""After all this time, I'm still only paid the national minimum wage of GBP6.50 an hour. So you see my colleagues and I are heavily reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages. I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, I get upset."" 
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more. Cafe Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco. 
A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a ""tronc"" - a standard pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff. ""We went to great lengths to set up this tronc system, which is chaired by a troncmaster and run by a committee of waiters and pizzaiolos who independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are subsequently distributed between front- and back-of-house restaurant teams; a system run by employees for the employees,"" she said. 
The chain, which sells 29m pizzas a year through its UK restaurants, denied that it profits from the admin fee. But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. Wagamama, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny's, Chiquitos and Garfunkels, used to charge 10% but dropped this policy several years ago. 
Unite recently targeted ten PizzaExpress restaurants in south London, distributing leaflets to customers who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by the practice. PizzaExpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus but the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, it always came as a surprise. Most would then pay the tip in cash. Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unite's online petition. 
One waiter, who doesn't work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips. He doesn't want to be identified for fear of reprisals. ""I work in a busy London branch and, on an average night, I'll serve 150 people and take home GBP40 to GBP50 in tips,"" he says. ""That might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me as my basic pay is only GBP6.50 an hour."" 
Conservative MP Andrew Percy, who has called for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips, said he plans to raise the issue in parliament after the summer recess.""

"Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, right, meets with Richard Holbrooke in Kabul on February 15, 2009.
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, Karzai said he is very, very thankful that President Barack Obama accepted his proposal to join the review.
Holbrooke is visiting Afghanistan after a trip to neighboring Pakistan. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tapped Holbrooke as special representative for the two countries, a signal of how the new administration considers Afghanistan and Pakistan intertwined in any solution to the war in Afghanistan and the terrorist threat along their shared border.
At the news conference in Kabul, Holbrooke said Sunday that he conveyed the administration's support of the upcoming elections on August 20, a date recently set by Afghanistan's electoral commission.
 President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision, Holbrooke said.
Holbrooke's visit comes as Obama plans to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight what he's called the central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism. 
In an interview on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, which aired Sunday, Karzai said that, with a resurgent Taliban, a still-flourishing drug trade and a border with Pakistan believed to be home base for al Qaeda, his country ca n't afford for U.S. troops to leave any time soon.
 U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over, Karzai said. We have to defeat terrorism. We 'll have to enable Afghanistan to stand on its own feet. We 'll have to enable Afghanistan to be able to defend itself and protect for its security...
 Then, the United States can leave and, at that time, the Afghan people will give them plenty of flowers and gratitude and send them safely back home. 
At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
 It's the question of civilian causalities. It's a question of risk of Afghans. It's the question of home searches, he said. These activities are seriously undermining the confidence of the Afghan people in the joint struggle we have against terrorism and undermining their hopeful future.
 We 'll continue to be a friend. We 'll continue to be an ally. But Afghanistan deserves respect and a better treatment. 
While he said he welcomes additional U.S. troops, Karzai suggested they need to work along the Afghan-Pakistan border and in the poppy fields that fuel a drug trade that threatens to turn the nation into a narco-state -- not in the villages where most Afghans live.
 We have traveled many years on. What should have happened early on did n't unfortunately happen, Karzai said. Now, the country is not in the same mood as it was in 2002. And so any addition of troops must have a purposeful objective that the Afghan people would agree with. 
The Obama administration is conducting several reviews of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, including a review by Gen. David Petraeus, the commander in the region. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said the original mission in Afghanistan was too broad and needs to be more realistic and focused for the United States to succeed.
 If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of central Asian Valhalla over there, we will lose, because nobody in the world has that kind of time, patience and money, Gates said during a recent Senate hearing.
He called for concrete goals that can be reached in three to five years.
Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush a great person, but said he can work with Obama -- despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had not gotten out of the bunker to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
 President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said. The people of America have proven that they can really be the light holders for change and the will of the people in the world.
 And his coming to power by the vote of the American people is a manifestation of that great power of the American people. 
Karzai also acknowledged corruption in the Afghan government, but defended the work he's done to combat it.
 Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country, he said.
 Suddenly this country got so much money coming from the West, suddenly so many Afghans came from all over the world to participate. Suddenly there were projects -- suddenly there were this poverty that turned into some sort form of prosperity for this country, he said.
He said a government department has been created to deal with corruption and that corrupt judges, administrators and other officials are dismissed daily over corruption charges.

"The Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, is located in the state of Arizona. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Formed by over 70 million years of erosion from the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon offers a spectacular view. The canyon spans 277 miles in length, up to 18 miles in width, and it measures over a mile in depth at its deepest points. Carlos always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon, and recently he received the chance to hike some of the trails and take several panoramic photographs during his visit.
When Carlos arrived at the visitor center, he watched a brief movie that taught tourists about the Grand Canyon National Park and the geological history of the canyon's formation. Later, Carlos followed a hiking trail to become even further acquainted with the canyon. While walking through the trails, Carlos saw some tourists riding donkeys to traverse the canyon's ridges. Throughout his hiking expedition, Carlos used a map to find some of the best hot spots for photographs within the canyon. He revisited some areas at different points in the day because sun angles and lighting can make a big difference in the quality of a photo.
Carlos was very pleased that he got to travel to the Grand Canyon. He loves hiking and photography, so this was the perfect outdoor experience for him. He posted all of his best pictures on social media, and his friends were amazed by his breathtaking, panoramic shots.",B2
"William Jefferson ""Bill"" Clinton was the 43rd American president, presiding over the country for eight years from 1993 to 2001. He was the third youngest president to hold the office, behind Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton was a very popular president, who led the country during one of the most successful eras in American history. His economic policies contributed greatly to the country's economic strength during his tenure. Clinton is a member of the Democratic Party, and served as governor of the state of Arkansas for two five-year terms. He is credited with overhauling the state's education system during his tenure.
 
Clinton presided over the longest, peacetime economic expansion in American history. He is married to Hillary Clinton who he met at Yale Law School. Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, after serving as senator of the state of New York from 2001 to 2009. Additionally, Hillary Clinton is considered one of the top prospects to gain the Democratic nomination for the presidential election in 2016. When Bill Clinton left office in 2001, he enjoyed the highest approval rating from the American public in the history of the United States, but his presidency was not without controversy.
Bill Clinton's presidency was marred by the Monica Lewinsky affair. Lewinski was a White House intern who engaged in sexual activity with the president. Bill Clinton denied any wrongdoing, but his political opponents, the Republicans, pursued Clinton in an effort to damage his reputation and the Democratic Party in general. Republican politicians tried to have Clinton impeached from office and dogged him for years. In the end, Clinton survived the controversy, and completed his successful term as president. Hillary stood by him during the dark times, and the couple remains together to this day.",B2
"Hugh Hefner is one of the most controversial public figures in the United States. He is the founder, and president of Playboy magazine, which is a men's adult magazine. From humble beginnings in the 1950s, Hefner has grown his pornographic industry into the multi-million-dollar enterprise, which includes his magazine publication, TV, and Internet media.
 
Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1926, Hefner led an average life growing up in the big city. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and majored in psychology. After serving two years in the United States Military, he began working as a copy editor at Esquire magazine in the early 50s. Hefner quit his job to go out on his own. He was determined to start a magazine that was similar to Esquire, a men's magazine. His first ""Playboy"" was published from his home in 1953, without a publication date. He did this because he was uncertain if there would be a second edition.
Hefner had purchased a nude picture of the famous actress, Marilyn Monroe, and used that image as the centerfold of his first issue. The 50,000 copies sold quickly, and Hefner became an instant success story. During the 60s, Hefner and Playboy were at the top of their popularity. His circulation was now in the millions, and Hefner ventured into new areas for his company. He produced films, started modeling agencies, built hotels and resorts, and hosted two television series. His publication was not without controversy, though.
In 1963, he was arrested and stood trial for publishing a photo of American actress, Jayne Mansfield. The charges were eventually dropped, but it was clear that there would be challenges to his publication because of its content. Hefner permanently moved his headquarters to Los Angeles in 1975 so that he could be closer to the film industry. He has been married three times, and has four children.",B2
"The Mexican national soccer team had just won a match against Croatia in the World Cup. This meant that Mexico advanced to the next round. Mexican soccer fans worldwide are known for loyalty to their team. After this win, however, some wonder if they took their loyalty too far.
 
In Huntington Park, California, fans took to the street after the win. The afternoon crowd grew to almost 200 people. The fans waved flags, yelled, honked their cars, and jumped around the streets. The crowd was so big that they blocked traffic. This caused traffic jams in the area. While most of these fans were just overzealous, a handful were intoxicated. Instead of just celebrating, they began throwing bottles. Some of the fans even began rocking cars parked on the streets. Police were called to the scene. Not only did the local police department send in patrol cars, two police helicopters flew overhead and some police on horseback began to try to disperse the crowd. Someone threw a bottle at a police horse. Police urged shop owners to close their businesses. The police arrested five people. Thankfully no one was hurt.
When Mexico played again the following week, police patrolled the streets in advance. This time they were going to be prepared if Mexico won again. Mexico was playing against the Netherlands. The Dutch team won 2-1. Mexican fans in Huntington Park still took to the streets despite the loss. This time the police were waiting in riot gear. The fans waved flags, chanted, honked horns, rocked cars and even lit firecrackers but no one threw bottles. The police didn't arrest anyone. They did have to close off three blocks to traffic, though. The police were probably secretly glad that Mexico didn't win. In four years, when the next World Cup happens, they'll worry about it again.",B2
"Christina visited Miami during her winter vacation. She is from Boston, where it is cold during the winter months. Miami, however, has a very warm climate. There are many sunny days in Miami, and people can go to the beach all year long. Christina spent a good portion of her trip on the beach to relax and sunbathe. However, she also explored Miami and its surroundings.
Inspired by Miami's proximity to the ocean, Christina visited the Miami Seaquarium to learn about marine life. There, she watched a show using trained dolphins, killer whales, and other aquatic mammals. She took a lot of pictures of the sea creatures jumping out of the water and performing tricks.
Christina also took an excursion to the Everglades National Park. This park is a protected area spanning 1.5 million acres. Because the park is mostly swampland, it is home to many reptiles. Native animals include snakes, alligators, and crocodiles. The park is also great for birdwatching. Christina enjoyed hiking the trails in the Everglades and observing the wildlife in its natural environment.
When Christina returned to the city, she visited Little Havana. This is Miami's Cuban neighborhood. Christina could see that Little Havana's people demonstrated a lot of pride for their Cuban heritage. There were many outdoor shops and vendors, live musicians, and the Cuban cuisine was delicious. Little Havana was Christina's favorite part about her trip to Miami. This neighborhood made Christina feel like she had traveled to Cuba without ever having to leave the United States.

"Levi Aron was arraigned in a New York court Thursday on charges of murder and kidnapping in the first degree in the killing of an 8-year-old boy and remanded under suicide watch until a mental evaluation is completed.
Aron, 35, showed no emotion as he entered the court handcuffed and did not enter a plea. He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Defense attorneys Pierre Bazile and Gerard Marrone told the court that Aron hears voices and requested an exam to determine whether he understands the charges. Aron's next court date is July 28.
Kings County District Attorney Charles J. Hynes had said he would ask a grand jury for the maximum charges permitted by law for the vicious and callous murder and dismemberment of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky. 
Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon.
Kelly called the case heartbreaking. 
 Obviously in this business you see a lot of violence, but there's usually some sort of irrational twisted logic that's given to why a violent event took place, Kelly said.
 Here, I mean it's just, it defies all logic and I think that's what's really so, so terribly disturbing about this case. There's absolutely no reason. There's nothing more innocent than an 8-year-old child and to be, you know, killed in this manner it's just... heartbreaking. 
Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky. Both are members of the close-knit Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn.
Kelly said detectives found the remains in a freezer in Aron's third-floor attic apartment and in a trash bin more than two miles away, wrapped in a black plastic garbage bag inside a suitcase.
A cause of death has yet to be determined but police believe Kletzky was suffocated.
Kletzky was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from his summer day camp, but became lost and asked the suspect for directions, Kelly said.
Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office Monday while Kletzky waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said.
Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said. Police said Aron went to the wedding, but have not been able to confirm that Kletzky actually went with him, as no one has said they 've seen him.
According to Kelly, police showed up at Aron's residence at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday and asked him about Kletzky's whereabouts. The suspect pointed them to the kitchen, where blood was visible on the freezer handle. Inside the refrigerator was a cutting board with three blood-spattered carving knives, Kelly said.
Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said. His only known criminal summons was for urinating in public last year.
Kelly said that statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, as a neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he became panicked and killed him.
 We 're all in shock, said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind of the people in his district. What kind of people are out there that are capable of creating these dastardly acts ? 
Aron's ex-wife, Debbie Aron of Memphis, Tennessee, said she has been in total shock since she heard the news.
She said her children from an earlier marriage lived with her when she was married to Levi Aron and that he helped take care of them. He also enjoyed karaoke.
 I can't believe it. It's definitely not in his character from... the person I knew, she told CNN affiliate WMC. Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong. 
After Kletzky went missing Monday, residents joined with local and federal authorities in a massive search effort.
FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said the FBI assisted in interviewing witnesses and deployed the FBI's Crimes Against Children squad in the case.
CNN's Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.

"Scott received a paintball gun and some paintballs from his mom for his 16th birthday. When his mom gave him the present, she told him that she would take him to a paintball range with some of his friends. The range was in an open field and the company that owned the range provided safety equipment like padding and facemasks. Getting hit by a paintball hurt and could cause serious injury. The paintball range was 20 miles away, and Scott had to wait till the weekend to try out his new equipment. He didn't want to wait that long. He wanted to play with his new toy now.
 
When his mom was taking a nap, he texted a friend who lived down the block to meet him in front of his house. ""I want to show you what I got for my birthday,"" Scott told his friend. He loaded up the paintball gun with the colored balls filled with brightly colored paint. He started shooting it at the trashcans that were on the curb. Just then a police patrol car was driving down the street. Scott missed the trashcans and ended up shooting a paintball right at the police car. The police thought they were under attack. Scott knew he had done something wrong and ran inside the house with his friend. Soon a police helicopter was flying overhead, and Scott could hear police sirens approaching his house.
The sounds of the helicopter and the sirens woke up Scott's mother. She looked out her window and saw a spotlight right on her house, and three police cars arrived. ""What is going on?"" she wondered aloud. She went to the living room and turned on the local news to see if there was any information about what was happening in her neighborhood.",B2
"The military released 77,000 of about 87,000 detainees locked up during the Iraq war because there was not enough evidence to hold them, CNN has learned.
 In most cases, if we do n't have anything, eventually they 'll be released, said Brig. Gen. David Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq.
Quantock said many cases are driven purely on intelligence. 
 Intelligence does not win a fight in a courtroom. It does n't win the fight in a courtroom in the United States. It does n't win in Iraq. 
According to the U.S. military, 76,985 detainees have been released out of the 87,011 captured during the Iraq war.
A CNN investigation found that frustration over the Army's policy on detainees may have led to the 2007 killings of four Iraqi men by three decorated Army sergeants at a Baghdad canal.
Former 1st Sgt. John Hatley, who led the mission that day, told CNN in a letter that the detainee policy has extensive flaws that repeatedly frustrated soldiers.
On Army interrogation tapes obtained by CNN, other soldiers complained about the Army rules for evidence gathering.
Despite the high release rate, Quantock said he has confidence soldiers can take basic evidence from a crime scene in Iraq.
 We 're asking them to take basic evidence, which they 've been trained to do, said Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq. We 've got the greatest soldiers in the world. And I do n't accept that they ca n't take basic evidence off of a crime scene. 
CNN asked Quantock to explain why, if it were so easy to collect evidence, so many detainees have been released.
 It took us a while to realize, it goes back to my point of we were trying to make the fight fit the Army as opposed to have the Army fit the fight, Quantock said.
 I think a lot of times we thought the insurgency would dissipate, we were working closely with the government of Iraq, we were trying to improve the Iraqi security forces, but at the end of the day, it did n't work out very well. We had to get better at taking evidence off the crime scene. 
A January 9, 2005, memo imposed detailed standards of evidence soldiers needed before taking in suspected insurgents in Iraq. Quantock told CNN the rules detailed in the memo were in effect through the end of 2008.
The memo spells out that evidence of criminal activity should include photos of physical evidence,  the detainee at the crime scene or place of capture, as well as photos of the detainee next to the evidence. Other evidence should include statements written by first-hand witnesses to the criminal activity, the memo states.
At the start of this year, the rules got even stricter. A security agreement with the government of Iraq now requires an arrest warrant signed by an Iraqi judge to detain someone.
Asked about the killings at the canal, Quantock told CNN: There's never an excuse to execute anyone. They become judge, jury and executioner.

"U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a tough-minded and pragmatic approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native.
Rep. Rahm Emanuel has experience in the White House, on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill.
Emanuel, a former top aide to President Clinton, has accepted the position in the new administration, Obama confirmed in a statement Thursday.
 I announce this appointment first because the chief of staff is central to the ability of a president and administration to accomplish an agenda, Obama said. And no one I know is better at getting things done than Rahm Emanuel. 
In the job, Emanuel would oversee the White House staff. The chief of staff is usually involved in all the major decisions that the president makes and is responsible for making sure the administration carries out the president's wishes. Watch Emanuel call himself fortunate 
The chief of staff also often is involved in negotiations with congressional leaders when major legislation is under consideration.
Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Emanuel: An excellent choice. 
 Rahm knows the Hill. And he knows the White House. He is a brilliant strategic thinker and someone who knows how to get things done, Manley said.
Manley also rejected the idea that Emanuel is a true partisan that could not work with Republicans.
 That's ridiculous. Rahm understands politics is the art of compromise. He's got a deeply held set of views but he also understands to get things done you have to compromise, he said.
After leaving the Clinton White House, Emanuel, 48, was an investment banker on Wall Street and later was elected to the House of Representatives in 2002 from a heavily Democratic Chicago district. He quickly rose to become the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. Watch what Emanuel brings to the White House 
It is Emanuel's combination of experiences -- plus his strong personal relationship with Obama -- that would make him a strong chief of staff, said CNN political analyst Paul Begala, a fellow Clinton veteran.
 He has spent more time in the White House than President-elect Obama has. That matters a lot. It is a special place with its own rhythms, Begala said. See who Obama may be considering for his Cabinet 
 But, maybe most importantly, he's got the relationship. He has known Barack and Michelle Obama for a number of years. 
Before reports emerged that he had accepted the position, Emanuel told WLS-TV in Chicago that he had to consider the possible impact on his family. Watch how Obama is starting his transition 
 I have a lot to weigh: the basis of public service, which I have given my life to, a career choice. And most importantly, what I want to do as a parent, Emanuel said in an interview that aired Wednesday.
Emanuel added: This is not a professional choice. This is a personal choice about what my wife and I want to do for our family, as much as what to do with my career. 
Emanuel's at-times blunt approach would ensure the White House runs smoothly for the new president, said Mack McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff. Watch as McLarty calls Emanuel an excellent choice 
 Rahm is high energy. He's direct. He's a tough-minded pragmatist. So I think the years have been good to him in that regard, McLarty said. I think the high-energy directness will serve him well.
 Rahm, like a lot of us, made mistakes, but he quickly corrected them. 
However, the lawmaker's direct style has ruffled a number of feathers in Washington, and Emanuel is known as one of the toughest partisan fighters on Capitol Hill.
After reports that Emanuel had agreed to be Obama's chief of staff on Thursday, the top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, questioned the president-elect's pick. Election T-shirt: Obama inspires historic victory
 This is an ironic choice for a president-elect who has promised to change Washington, make politics more civil and govern from the center, Boehner said.
According to a 2006 profile of Emanuel in Fortune magazine, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma warned his fellow Republicans of Emanuel's ferocity in a letter two years ago.
 He's dangerous, Cole told Fortune then. He has a closing intensity. When he's got a political kill in sight, he's absolutely relentless. 
But David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst who has worked in five administrations, said the contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president get things done in Washington.
 They are obviously setting up a good cop/bad cop routine in the White House.... Barack Obama can be the good guy, Gergen said. iReport.com: Who should be in Obama's cabinet ?
Emanuel has made a career of being the tough guy.
In the 2006 Fortune profile, Begala described Emanuel's aggressive style as a cross between a hemorrhoid and a toothache. 
 I love Rahm, but that's a small group of us, he told Fortune.

"The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing and unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon Martin.
 Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of you 're going to die now or you 're going to die tonight, something to that effect, Robert Zimmerman told Orlando news station WOFL. He continued to beat George. At some point, George pulled his pistol. Did what he did. 
In the interview Robert Zimmerman, his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting that has caused outrage throughout the nation, moved President Obama to call it a tragedy and prompted a federal investigation.
Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually.
 He was punched in the nose. His nose was broken, Robert Zimmerman said. He was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him. In the face. In his nose, hitting his head on the concrete. 
Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation.
The elder Zimmerman's account was disputed by Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts.
A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car.
The video, first broadcast Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video did not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face.
 The injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all, said Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial. He moves freely. He moves fluidly, not like someone who has just been through a beating in anyway shape or form, someone's whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described, someone who's nose was broken and bleeding. That tells you a great deal. 
Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly.
 I believe that this video is the icing on the cake, she said. This is not the first part of the evidence that they have had. They have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses. This is in addition to what the Sanford Police Department has always had. There is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested. 
The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, as Martin was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida. He was wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store.
Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community. Zimmerman has not been arrested and authorities have said said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened.
The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest.
Robert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism.
 I never foresaw so much hate coming from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP. Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way, Robert Zimmerman told WOFL. But there's so much hate that I have never been involved in hate and George has n't. It's really unbelievable. 
Robert Zimmerman said her son is not racist and race had nothing to do with incident.
 He would do anything to help anybody at any time. He's color blind when it comes to any race, Robert Zimmerman said.
Tracy Martin, Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son.
In a recording of Zimmerman's call to police, some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur.
Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman used a racial slur.
Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, a family spokesman has said. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag was determined to contain marijuana residue.
Crump, Martin's parentsattorney, said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth.
Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida.
But as more and more information surfaces, the picture of what happened becomes more complicated.
Despite the twists and turns in the case Fulton, Martin's mother, says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case.
 I feel confident that they 're going to do a thorough investigation, Fulton said. We 're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We 're trying to be patient, and we 're trying to press on for justice.

"Tony was really excited to see his friend Kevin. They had been friends since elementary all the way through high school. When they started college, they both headed their separate ways. Tony wanted to study in electrical engineering, and Kevin wanted to become a doctor. Their career choices led them into different directions, but their friendship was still intact.
 
Tony and Kevin had been very close friends in elementary. They started their friendship while doing a small painting assignment. When Kevin noticed Tony painting a really nice rocket, Kevin complimented him on it and the two started talking about their interest in other things. What really kept them together at that moment was when Tony acknowledged Kevin's reaction when Tony accidentally dropped his set of paints on the classroom floor. Tony was embarrassed and terrified, but Kevin wasn't hesitant to help him out by cleaning it up.
Growing up, Tony and Kevin shared similar interests. When they were in elementary, they both shared a dream of becoming astronauts and flying in spaceships to discover unknown galaxies and unknown life forms. In middle school, they both shared the dream of becoming famous basketball players. Then, in high school, they both had the urge to become famous rock stars.
It wasn't always a cheerful friendship. Sometimes, they both fought and shared different views about different things. Despite their differences, Tony and Kevin didn't tear their friendship apart. In moments of grief and doubts, they were there to support each other.
Tony and Kevin have both recently received their bachelor's degree. They have kept in contact up until now, and have decided to get together and catch up on lost time.

"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was one of the most successful and well-liked children's show in the history of Public Television. Public TV differs from the more common commercial television in that it is not funded by advertising revenue. Public Television is a network of television stations throughout the country that is dedicated to bringing alternative programming to the people of the United States.
 
Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood ran from February 1968 through August 2001, and was hosted by the show's namesake, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's show that featured the popular Rogers as host. It is often referred to as the Mr. Rogers show.
Rogers began his show in 1953 on a PBS station in the northeast part of the country as the Children's Corner. He performed as a puppeteer, and it was aired on live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his show went on the national TV stage, and remained there until 2001.
Rogers' style and calm demeanor made him an instant celebrity who was well-liked by both children and adults. In his early life, Rogers studied to become a Presbyterian minister, but didn't like how children's programming was being presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local show on public television. During the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his most liked characteristics.
Rogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights advocate. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the Peabody Award for meritorious public service. Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and has received approximately 40 honorary degrees.",B2
"Former F1 champion Michael Schumacher has been discharged from a Swiss hospital and is returning to his home, where he 'll continue his recovery from head injuries suffered in a skiing accident last year, his spokeswoman said Tuesday.
 Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months, said Sabine Kehm.
 There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead. 
Schumacher, 45, sustained severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29.
His investigative team said it thinks the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face-first onto another rock.
He was treated first at a hospital in Grenoble, in France, and then in June moved to a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the Schumacher family home.
Kehm appealed, as she has previously, for the privacy of his family to be respected as Schumacher continues his recovery.
The German national is a seven-time world champion whose F1 racing career ended in 2012.

"They call him the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out dozens of loans, worth almost half a million euros, with no intention of ever paying them back. Instead, Enric Duran handed the money out to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism. 
After 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could land him in jail. ""I'm proud of what I did,"" he said in an interview by Skype from an undisclosed location. The money, he said, had created opportunities. ""It generated a movement that allowed us to push forward with the construction of alternatives. And it allowed us to build a powerful network that groups together these initiatives."" 
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain. He farmed the money out to social activists, funding speaking tours against capitalism and TV cameras for a media network. ""I saw that, on one side, these social movements were building alternatives but that they lacked resources and communication capacities,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, our reliance on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing."" 
The loans he swindled from banks were his way of regulating and denouncing this situation, he said. He started slowly. ""I filled out a few credit applications with my real details. They denied me, but I just wanted to get a feel for what they were asking for."" 
From there, the former table-tennis coach began to weave an intricate web of accounts, payments and transfers. ""I was learning constantly."" By the summer of 2007, he had discovered how to make the system work, applying for loans under the name of a false television production company. ""Then, I managed to get a lot."" EUR492,000, to be exact. 
Duran was arrested in Spain in 2009, on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money. He spent two months in prison before being bailed for EUR50,000. In February 2013, facing up to eight years in prison, he decided to flee rather than stand trial. ""I don't see legitimacy in a judicial system based on authority, because I don't recognize its authority,"" he said. 
His actions, he said, were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis. The timing pushed the anti-capitalist movement into the light, just as many Spaniards were seeking alternatives to a system that had wreaked havoc on their lives. 
While the same actions would probably be better understood in today's Spain, he said that they would not be needed. The anti-capitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards, he said, evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the Indignados. 
Success has helped the movement become self- sufficient. ""We now have the capacity to generate resources,"" said Duran, adding somewhat ironically that this was exactly what banks issue credit for - ""to advance and generate a situation that allows you to be independent"". Duran is widening his focus to include Spain's justice system, by promoting restorative justice. ""The people in Spain who believe that banks don't work, they think that I don't owe anything. I've already done my work,"" he said. ""But there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and I think I should respond to that."" 
In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently. He could share his thoughts on ""which best practices work and the bad ones that don't,"" he suggested, ""for the general population and for bank workers"".

"Boxing is big in America. The history of the sport precedes the establishment of the United States by thousands of years. The ancient Greeks are said to have included a form of boxing as far back as 600 BC. The modern sport of boxing can be traced to the 16th Century when it became a popular sport in Great Britain. Today, the sport still uses a variation of the Marquess of Queensberry rules that were established in 1867. Boxing is the purest form of competition. It pits one man, or woman, against another in an enclosed ring with only the person's fists as weapons. Early matches in the United States featured bare-knuckle fighting, but today boxers use protective gloves.
 
One of the most successful boxers in America is Mike Tyson. Tyson holds several boxing records. The greatest is possibly when he became the youngest boxer ever to win the heavyweight championship in three different boxing organizations. Tyson was just over 20 years old when he accomplished this feat. He was one of the most feared fighters of his time. Tyson won a total of 50 fights with 44 of those victories coming by knockout.
Twelve of Tyson's knockouts came in the first round, which earned him the nickname of Iron Mike. Eventually, his advancing age and fast living took their toll on Tyson. By the early 90s, his career was virtually over. Even though his boxing career lasted until 2002, Tyson was never the same. He went on to a brief acting career, most notably in the popular 2009 comedy hit The Hangover.
Tyson's post-boxing career had its ups and downs. He appeared on Barbara Walter's talk show with his wife, television actress Robin Givens, where Givens called Tyson a manic-depressive, and that living with him was pure torture. Tyson was arrested in 1991 for raping an 18-year-old girl, and spent several years in jail. He has attempted several comebacks, but has never regained his old glory.",B2
"The Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly called Woodstock, was an American music and art celebration that took place from August 15 - 18, 1969. It was billed as ""3 Days of Peace and Music,"" and was a defining event for the young generation of Americans of the time.
 
The 1960s was an impactful era in American history. Many of the events that took place during those controversial 10 years profoundly affect modern American society today. The war in Vietnam was raging in the 60s, and the popular president, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. These are just two of the events that defined the decade. There were many more historic events during that era that deeply divided the country. Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist with the older generation of Americans by living in harmony with one another.
Although the event did not occur in the town of Woodstock, New York, the city has become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York to witness music history in the making. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of ""the 50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll."" Some of the biggest names in rock history performed at the three-day event, including The Who, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In all, 32 acts performed at the outdoor festival, and it was free of charge to all.
Two soundtracks were released in the following two years. Both albums featured the live performances with introductions. The documentary film ""Woodstock"" was released in 1970, and received an Oscar in the Academy Award for Feature Documentary category. It was also deemed a Culturally Significant, by the United States, Library of Congress.",B2
"Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-Apartheid activist, and human rights advocate, whose life had a profound effect on American culture. Mandela served as president of South Africa from 1994 through 1999, but his story began decades earlier. His life's work was to bring South Africa into mainstream 20th Century thinking by ending Apartheid.
 
Apartheid was a system of South African government that was based on racial segregation between the minority white population and black South Africans. It was a controversial form of government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social turmoil. The system was put into place following World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country. Apartheid separated South Africans by race by placing people into four classifications: white, black, coloured, and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans being the most favored.
From 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million black South Africans were forcibly removed from their homes; in 1970, all non-white politicians were removed from government. Mandela's move to end Apartheid began in 1949 when he supported, and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes, and civil disobedience. He was arrested, and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social uprising, and was eventually jailed for 27 years. During this time, most of the countries in the world called for his release, and placed trade embargos against the white regime.
The country finally gave in to international pressure, and released Mandela. He became an international symbol for peaceful demonstration, and for his humanitarian work and perseverance. He was elected President of South Africa in 1994, serving for six years. Mandela died in December, 2013.",B2
"In the end, it was always Robin.
That was the big bombshell from Monday night's final episode of How I Met Your Mother, which piled on one surprise after another.
When Ted finally finished the story for his kids, they called him on it: His story was n't all about how he met their mother -LRB- she was barely in the story -RRB-, it was about how much he loved Robin.
As many had theorized, the mother of Ted's children -LRB- whose name was Tracy McConnell, by the way -RRB-, had been dead for years by the time he told his story.
So, in the last of many flash-forwards in this finale, Ted went to the street in front of Robin's apartment and showed up with that blue French horn, the same one he stole for her in the first episode.
Robin, of course, had long ago divorced Barney -- the first big shocker of the night.
Barney, however, we would learn, became a father, and in one of several touching scenes from the episode, finally found the love of his life in baby Ellie.
Marshall and Lily, pregnant with their second child in the present day, went on to have a third, but Lily was heartbroken when Robin decided she could n't be as much a part of their gang anymore, due in part to Barney continuing to be, well, Barney around her.
And what about the mother, aka Tracy ? We finally did see that moment of the two meeting at that train station, and it was played perfectly by Josh Radnor and the Emmy-worthy Cristin Milioti.
They would n't get married for several years, having postponed their wedding when Tracy got pregnant with their first child.
Ted shared with his kids that he learned he had to love their mother with everything he had in him, through good times and bad, especially during her illness.
Needless to say, the show stayed true to form, as it had in all its nine years, wearing its heart on its sleeve. And if your eyes stayed dry through the entire episode, you 're probably a stronger person than most viewers.
Of course, the big Robin twist did n't exactly sit well with everyone online -LRB- people such as Rocco Horvath @RoccoRacingAMA, who tweeted, It took me so long to get over the fact Ted and Robin were n't going to end up together and now this ?! Mixed Emotions -RRB-, and the finale seems to have split viewers more than any since Lost. 
Other viewers were more forgiving. #HIMYM creators stayed true to the story, tweeted fan John Eisele. Finale fit the show, even if it is not what I wanted. Ca n't stop thinking about it. #HIMYMFinale. 
What do you think ? Do you wish Tracy had stayed alive and Ted did n't ultimately end up with Robin ? Or do you think it was a fitting ending ? For that matter, what do you think about Barney and Robin splitting up ? Let us know in the comments and give yourself a self-five for making it all the way through nine seasons.

"Gabriela worked for a multinational company as a successful project manager in Brazil and was transferred to manage a team in Sweden. She was excited about her new role but soon realised that managing her new team would be a challenge.
Despite their friendliness, Gabriela didn't feel respected as a leader. Her new staff would question her proposals openly in meetings, and when she gave them instructions on how to carry out a task, they would often go about it in their own way without checking with her. When she announced her decisions on the project, they would continue giving their opinions as if it was still up for discussion.
After weeks of frustration, Gabriela emailed her Swedish manager about the issues she was facing with her team. Her manager simply asked her if she felt her team was still performing, and what she thought would help her better collaborate with her team members. Gabriela found her manager vague and didn't feel as if he was managing the situation satisfactorily.
What Gabriela was experiencing was a cultural clash in expectations. She was used to a more hierarchical framework where the team leader and manager took control and gave specific instructions on how things were to be done. This more directive management style worked well for her and her team in Brazil but did not transfer well to her new team in Sweden, who were more used to a flatter hierarchy where decision making was more democratic. When Gabriela took the issue to her Swedish manager, rather than stepping in with directions about what to do, her manager took on the role of coach and focused on getting her to come up with her own solutions instead.
Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede uses the concept of 'power distance' to describe how power is distributed and how hierarchy is perceived in different cultures. In her previous work environment, Gabriela was used to a high power distance culture where power and authority are respected and everyone has their rightful place. In such a culture, leaders make the big decisions and are not often challenged. Her Swedish team, however, were used to working in a low power distance culture where subordinates often work together with their bosses to find solutions and make decisions. Here, leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thought and expect to be challenged.
When Gabriela became aware of the cultural differences between her and her team, she took the initiative to have an open conversation with them about their feelings about her leadership. Pleased to be asked for their thoughts, Gabriela's team openly expressed that they were not used to being told what to do. They enjoyed having more room for initiative and creative freedom. When she told her team exactly what she needed them to do, they felt that she didn't trust them to do their job well. They realised that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or make changes to her decisions, and were able to explain that it was how they'd always worked.
With a better understanding of the underlying reasons behind each other's behaviour, Gabriela and her team were able to adapt their way of working. Gabriela was then able to make adjustments to her management style so as to better fit the expectations of her team and more effectively motivate her team to achieve their goals.",B2
"Abraham Lincoln is a name that is forever embedded into the collective conscience of every American. It is perhaps the most recognizable name in the history of the country even as his death occurred approximately 150 years ago. Lincoln presided over the country during, what is perhaps, the most divisive era in its history. Lincoln served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at the time, and today, has been huge.
 
During his presidency, the United States was in the middle of a terrible civil war. At the center of the split between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast-growing, industrial region that was more progressive than their southern counterpart. The southern economy was based on cotton production that mostly used forced labor. The north viewed this practice as unethical, and immoral, while southerners claimed it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the election, the southern states began to secede from the Union, and the war began.
Lincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with his wife.",B2
"He arrived - in his own words, in 2005 - as ""a simple, humble worker in God's vineyard"". And on a grey, cold, blustery Monday in February, Pope Benedict XVI signed off in the same fashion: like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back; who can no more count on the strength of his arms. Characteristically for this most traditionally minded of pontiffs, he made his excuses in Latin. The first German pope in modern times timed his departure to the minute. ""From 28 February 2013, at 20.00 hours"", he told a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican, ""the see of Rome, the see of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new supreme pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is."" 
Among those present was a Mexican prelate, Monsignor Oscar Sanchez Barba, from Guadalajara. He was in Rome to be told the date for a canonization in which he has played a leading role. ""We were all in the Sala del Concistoro in the third loggia of the Apostolic Palace,"" he said. ""After giving the date for the canonization, the twelfth of May, the Pope took a sheet of paper and read from it. 
""We were all left ..."" - Sanchez Barba looked around him in the Bernini colonnade that embraces St Peter's Square, grasping for the word, as speechless as the ""princes of the church"" who had just heard the man they believe to be God's representative on earth give up on the job. ""The cardinals were just looking at one another,"" Sanchez Barba said. 
Angelo Sodano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who must have been forewarned, delivered a brief and perhaps hurriedly composed speech. Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals' loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had ""listened to you with a sense of bewilderment, almost completely incredulous "". At the end of his address, the Pope blessed those present, and left. ""It was so simple; the simplest thing imaginable,"" said Sanchez Barba. ""Then we all left in silence. There was absolute silence ... and sadness."" 
John Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the Holy See and whose book, The Vatican Diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had an intuition the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly. A fellow-Vatican watcher confirmed this to be the case. Thavis noted that in the book-length interview Benedict gave to a German journalist, published as Light of the World in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job. ""I asked myself: if I were Pope and wanted to resign, when would I choose? He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground. What is more, there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend. I thought the most likely date was 22 February, which is the Feast of the Chair of St Peter. So I got it wrong."" 
The line emerging from the Vatican within hours of the announcement was that the Pope's decision was a brave one. By this account, Benedict - never one to shrink from utterances and decisions that shocked - had taken it upon himself to bring his church face to face with reality: the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive far beyond the age at which they are up to grappling with the demands of running a vast global organization. Thavis agreed: ""What I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he's doing it because he's tired and not because he's particularly ill."" But is that the whole story? Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public? 
Benedict's own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical, but also his psychological condition: ""In order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me."" Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election. Already there is speculation that something was about to come out about Benedict's past. The Vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with contempt. But they are understandable all the same, for the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated. 
Emerging from St Peter's Basilica, Julia Rochester, from London, who described herself as a lapsed Catholic, was still turning over the implications of the Pope's resignation. ""If you're God's chosen one, how do you choose not be chosen?"" she mused. It is a question many practising Catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead. In his first speech as Pope - humbly disclaiming his fitness for the task - Benedict said: ""I am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools."" At some point in the last eight years, it would seem, he ceased to believe that was true.

"Austrian director Michael Haneke took home the prestigious Palme d'Or prize -- his second -- at the Cannes Film Festival for his film Amour. 
The film, according to the festival's website, is about a retired couple in their 80s and how their bond is severely tested after the woman, Anne, has an attack. It features actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva.
Haneke also won the Palme d'Or at the festival in 2009 for The White Ribbon. That film depicted the cruel punishments meted out at a rural German school before World War I.
 The Palme d'Or is the best prize a filmmaker can win, said Haneke at a press conference following his 2009 award. I am not proud, but I am very happy. In my opinion, it's silly to be proud. 
Another contender for the top prize was Moonrise Kingdom, a film by Wes Anderson that tells the tale of two young lovers who reunite and run away into the wilderness in 1965 after a year apart.
The film stars Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton along with Anderson favorite Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. But it's the two young lovers, portrayed by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, who steal the show.
 My point of view about it was the memory of feeling that way is so strong for me, Anderson told CNN earlier this week. Rather than starting with an idea of a character or characters and a setting, instead I was starting out with a feeling. An emotion. A memory of an emotion that I was hoping to recreate in some way. 
Pictures from 65th annual Cannes Film Festival
 Moonrise Kingdom was one of a handful of American movies in the 22-strong competition section. Others included John Hillcoat's Prohibition-era move Lawless, with Shia LaBoeuf, Gary Oldman and Guy Pearce; Andrew Dominick's thriller Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt; Lee Daniels The Paperboy with Zac Efron, Matthew McConaughey and Nicole Kidman. Also featured is Jeff Nichols Mud with McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon and David Cronenberg's Don DeLillo adaptation Cosmopolis starting Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame and Juliette Binoche.
In addition, Kanye West also premiered a short film/art installation, Cruel Summer, at the festival, which kicked off May 16. It stars Kid Cudi as a car thief who falls in love with a blind Arabian princess, but West also makes an appearance.
And British rock start Pete Doherty, the on-again, off-again lead singer of the Libertines, also made his acting debut in Confession of a Child of the Century, which screened at the festival.
Last year's Palme d'Or prize went to The Tree of Life, a film from American director and writer Terrence Malick.

"""Go ahead, make my day"" is one of the most famous cinema lines ever spoken in the history of Hollywood. The actor was Clint Eastwood, and the film was 1983's Sudden Impact. Eastwood's words became an instant catchphrase that many Americans can recite to this day. Eastwood is quite possibly the epitome of the macho American man. He holds icon-like status among males for portraying the tough guy in nearly all his films.
 
Eastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco before coming to Los Angeles at an early age. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College, but soon dropped out to pursue an acting career. After appearing in a couple of low-budget films, Eastwood got his big break in the old TV western Rawhide. His character Rowdy Yates was an instant celebrity, and it launched Eastwood's incredible career. Eastwood first burst onto the big screen with his roles in three western movies in the 1960s. The so-called Spaghetti Westerns, which were called that because of their ties to Italian cinema, were all very successful, and made Eastwood a household name.
Eastwood followed his success with a string of movies that is unparalleled in Hollywood history. He starred in the very popular Dirty Harry franchise, where he, once again, played the tough guy. In this series, Dirty Harry is a San Francisco police officer who takes matters into his own hands. This troubles his superiors to no end, but Harry always wins. This persona delighted the American movie audiences, especially the men.
Acting was not the only talent Eastwood would eventually display. He became an Oscar-winning director also. Arguably, his best film as a director was Million Dollar Baby, but it is hard to pick one film from his impressive list of movies. He is still active in film at the age of 74.",B2
"A passenger aboard Continental Airlines Flight 1404 described a scene of panic as the plane skidded off the runway while trying to take off and caught fire Saturday at Denver International Airport in Colorado.
Passenger Gabriel Trejos says he saw an engine on fire as the plane skidded to a halt.
 Everybody was trying to get off the plane, passenger Gabriel Trejos told CNN affiliate KUSA. Everybody was yelling, The plane's going to blow up, the plane's going to blow up ! '
Only one of the 38 people taken to hospitals was listed in serious condition and none appeared to be burn victims, said Patrick Hynes, chief of the airport division of the Denver Fire Department. Bone fractures and bruises were the most common complaint, he said.
Trejos said when the plane hit the ground, he saw an engine on fire and seats buckling toward each other.
 It just seemed like it took forever for the plane to stop, Trejos said. On my side of the plane I could see the engine, I noticed it was on fire. I could feel the heat coming from the window. Watch Trejos describe seeing engine on fire 
Airport officials said it was too soon to determine the cause of the accident or the fire.
The flight was bound for Houston, Texas, and was taking off at about 6:20 p.m.
Firefighters found the Boeing 737 on fire, with its wheels sheared off, resting in a ravine about 200 yards from the runway, Hynes said.
 They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them, Hynes said.
Hynes said the entire right side of the jet was on flames and a heck of a firefight followed.
 There was significant extension of fire into the cabin portion, he said. There's significant fire damage inside with the luggage department described as melting and dropping down into the seats. 
Hynes said fuel from the aircraft leaked for several hours after the mishap, but the fire was out.
 As far as we know, there were no fatalities and we believe no critical injuries, Denver International Airport manager of aviation Kim Day told reporters late Saturday. Watch airport official describe scene of accident 
Continental issued a statement late Saturday saying it was collecting information about the accident. The 112 people on the plane included five crew members.
Planes resumed takeoffs and landings at the airport after the incident, although Day said a section of the airport will remain closed into Sunday. She suggested passengers call ahead for Sunday departure times since many flights may be delayed.
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board -LRB- NTSB -RRB- was on its way to the scene to start an investigation.

"Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ as told in the Bible. Christians are found in church on Easter. Some Christians participate in an Easter vigil or nighttime mass, sometimes held by candlelight. Easter is never on a set date. It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes this break is called Easter or Spring break.
 
In the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs. Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny. According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children. Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans, and marshmallows.
Another activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country. The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue and yellow.
In New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade. The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets.",B2
"The 54 men and 14 boys rescued after being found chained this week at an Islamic religious school in Pakistan have been reunited with their families or placed in shelters, authorities said.
The group was discovered in an underground room with heavy chains linking them together.
The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which also was a drug rehab clinic, is in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi.
All 14 boys were returned to their families, senior police official Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN.
Of the adults, 47 had been released to their families, and seven were handed over to a shelter for the homeless, he said.
Three people who worked at the facility were arrested, but the four men who ran the place were still at large, Marwat said.
Officials said the facility was part madrassa and part drug-rehab facility, and the captives were chained at night apparently to prevent their escape.
 The operation was successful, and we plan on continuing our work to ensure that places like this are shut down, Marwat said.
Many of the captives told police their families sent them there because they were recovering drug addicts. During the day, they worked and did religious studies.
But the future of the rescued children was unclear.
One woman told a local television station that she was willing to pay the police to keep her troublesome child. She said she would rather have the facility remain open, regardless of how it treated the children.
Many others, however, said they were in shock and disbelief over the allegations.
One man complained he was deep in debt after paying the school a large amount of money to board his son.

"The Williams sisters continued their march towards more Olympic success with three victories between them in London on Monday.
Fourth seed Serena romped into the third round of the women's singles with a 6-2 6-3 win over Poland's Ursula Radwanska, whose older sister Agnieszka she beat to win her fifth Wimbledon title earlier this month.
The American will next face Russian 13th seed Vera Zvonareva, who knocked out 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone.
Zvonareva, the bronze medalist at Beijing four years ago, triumphed 6-3 6-3.
 It was tough conditions, a little windy. I 'm glad I was able to pull through, said Williams, who faces a possible quarterfinal against former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki or Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova as she seeks the only major title missing from her collection.
Her older sibling Venus, who is in the same half of the draw, bounced back from her early exits at the French Open and Wimbledon by thrashing Roland Garros runnerup Sara Errani 6-3 6-1 in her delayed first-round match.
 Another gold medal would be amazing, said the 32-year-old, who won the singles title in 2000 along with the doubles, which she and Serena won again in 2008.
 I ca n't even imagine the feeling, I think my head would be too big and no one would even like me anymore. I 've got to get there first, I have two chances and I 'll go for it. 
Venus will next play Canada's Aleksandra Wozniak, who progressed into the second round by winning 6-2 6-1 against Marina Erakovic of New Zealand.
If she wins that game, Williams will play either German seventh seed Angelique Kerber or Hungary's Timea Babos for a place in the quarterfinals.
That could mean a last-eight clash with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who survived a second-set scare to beat 79th-ranked Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1 3-6 6-1 in her opening match on Centre Court.
The Belorussian, who lost to Serena in the Wimbledon semifinals, will next face Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain.
Serena and Venus also won their opening doubles match, beating Romania's Sorana Cirstea and Simona Halep 6-3 6-2 to set up a clash with Kerber and Sabine Lisicki.
Lisicki also moved into round two of the singles, coming from behind to beat Tunisian teen Ons Jabeur -- ranked 297th -- and securing a match against Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova.
The winner of that tie will likely face world No. 3 Maria Sharapova, who next plays Britain's Laura Robson.
Former world No. 1s Kim Clijsters and Ana Ivanovic will meet in round three, while Czech sixth seed Petra Kvitova -- whose Wimbledon defense was ended by Serena Williams in the quarterfinals -- will take on Italy's Flavia Pennetta.

"New Year's Day officially begins as soon as people yell ""Happy New Year"" at midnight. Most people continue partying well after midnight into the wee hours of the first day of the new year. In fact, many New Year's parties include breakfast or brunch. Sometimes at the stroke of midnight there will be fireworks and couples often kiss. One of the most famous New Year's celebrations takes place in New York City's Time Square, where a huge cut crystal ball drops at midnight in front of millions of people standing in the cold. Many more millions watch on television. Some groups, called Polar Bear Clubs, jump into the cold ocean water on New Year's Day as a literal way to start the new year fresh.
 
New Year's Day, January 1, is a national holiday in the United States. This means that schools, banks, government offices, and post offices are closed. Given how much people tend to drink alcohol on New Year's Eve, many people wake up on New Year's Day with a hangover. The national holiday is a good day to recover.
Many people go out partying with their friends on New Year's Eve; many people use New Year's Day to visit family members. New Year's Day is also when many people start on their New Year's resolutions. A resolution is a promise to change a lifestyle habit. The most common resolution is to lose weight. Many people also join gyms as part of their resolutions.
On New Year's Day there are also parades such as the famous Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, where all the floats are made of different colored roses and they compete for awards. Many people also watch college and professional football games, including the Rose Bowl, which is also held in Pasadena, California.

"Memorial Day weekend has, over the years, turned in large part into something it was not originally intended to be:
Seventy-two hours of barbecues and ballgames, of swimming-pool openings, of high-decibel sales pitches by merchandisers hoping to cash in on the unofficial start of summer.
Which, to a degree, is understandable. The weather is turning warm, there's a holiday feel to the break from work, and the solemnity and grieving for those who gave their lives in the pursuit of peace seems to sometimes get pushed aside.
But it is that pursuit of peace, with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices, that remains the centerpiece of Memorial Day.
And this weekend it might be worth pausing, if only for a moment, to reflect upon a quotation that has variously been attributed to Winston Churchill and to George Orwell:
 We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. 
Through history, peace in the world has often, of necessity, been attained by the most brutal means available during military conflict. There is a dichotomy intrinsic to wars waged in pursuit of peace -- an uneasy divide between lightness and shadows. Tranquility born of bloodshed; happiness the end result of horror. We do n't like to think too much about that, and no wonder. The truth behind it goes against our better nature.
What is the most beloved image celebrating the joyous end of World War II ?
It's the Alfred Eisenstaedt photo of the sailor and the nurse embracing in Times Square. Even now, more than 60 years later, that photo makes people weep with glad emotion, makes them grin with across-the-generations exultation. That photo, it is often declared, says it all.
But there would be no photo of the sailor and the nurse were it not for scenes no one likes to see in photographs: the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that brought the awful years of war to a close. It is perfectly explicable that we much prefer bathing ourselves in exuberant images of the first hours of peace, rather than the gruesome images of the last hours of war.
One person who was in fact present during those last hours of World War II was Paul Tibbets. During the many days and evenings I spent with him during the final years of his life, there were occasions when the conversation would turn to that photo of the sailor and the nurse. Sometimes, when we were traveling together and he would be attending a military reunion, someone would approach him with a copy of the photo.
Paul would never say anything. He 'd look over at me and merely raise his eyebrows, almost imperceptibly. He was n't the photographer, but Eisenstaedt would have had nothing to photograph were it not for him.
He was the man -- the military aviator -- assigned by the United States government to put together, in utter secrecy, the unit that would carry out the atomic raids on Japan. When the day came, he did n't delegate; he flew the B-29 named Enola Gay -- his mother's name -- to Hiroshima with one goal in mind: to make the war stop. To let the soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines go home at last, to rejoin their families or start new families, to somehow, after all the suffering and all the heartbreak, find peace.
Of course the sailor and the nurse are the preferred visual representation of victory. What Paul Tibbets, navigator Dutch Van Kirk, bombardier Tom Ferebee and their crew were asked to do over the skies of Japan is something that is difficult for many people to think about; it's much more pleasant to smile at the sight of the kiss in New York.
Peace is the sun-dappled result, but getting there can be a path of darkness upon darkness. Which is why, on Memorial Day weekend, it is probably reasonable that some people reflexively turn away from thoughts of battlefields and death. The people who turn away are generally not the ones whose family members have in wartime trod that dark and lonely path.
On the occasions through the centuries when long wars have come to an end, many newspapers have chosen to go with the most glorious single-word, all-capital-letters headline of all:
PEACE !
Is there a word in the English language that is more welcome, more highly cherished ? That is more likely to be greeted with exhilaration and prayerful relief by all who see it ? Nearly every desire a person, or a nation, can have is embodied in that single syllable.
All the lightness and all the shadows, all the wars waged at terrible costs, all in pursuit of peace. To get to such a state of harmony has never been a peaceful journey.
Which is why the word is so beautiful, so yearned for:
Because it sounds so simple while remaining so rare.

"Chanuka, which can also be spelled as Hanukkah, is an 8-day Jewish holiday. It is known as the Festival of Lights, which celebrates the dedication of an ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. According to the Hebrew, or Jewish Bible, a miracle took place then. A one-day supply of oil miraculously lasted eight days. The dates of Hanukkah always change, but usually occur anywhere in late November to Late December.
 
The main way people observe the holiday is by lighting a candle on a candelabra, a special candle holder with space for 9 candles on each of the 8 nights. This candelabra is called a menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people also use oil lamps. The 9th candle space is usually higher than the others and is lit on every night. This 9th candle is there so that people can see the other candles they are lighting. So, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on. Some families have the head of household light the candles. Other families share the responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a window facing the street. The candles are supposed to stay lit for at least 30 minutes after it gets dark. There are also special prayers people say and holy songs sung when the candles are lit.
Schools and government offices are open for Hanukkah since the observances happen at night. Some families exchange gifts on each night of the holiday. Some foods traditionally eaten on Hanukkah include latkes, fried potato pancakes, and doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and remind people of the oil that lasted for 8 nights. Children play with a special four-sided spinning top called a dreidel.",B2
"In the central plaza, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and revelry unmatched by any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say.
But where there was joy now sits a vast settlement of people left without loved ones, without homes, without life's belongings.
Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed. Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information.
But this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation.
Musicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. A month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars plaza is home to the capital's displaced, where thousands of people have eked out a tiny space in which to survive.
Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath
 This is the first time Carnival is not happening, said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice. I do n't even think about music anymore. 
Less than a week ahead of Carnival's start on Sunday, revelry is replaced with mourning. The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They will not be able to play again.
 I do n't think we have time to think of Carnival, Lassegue said. Maybe when we are finished crying. 
Carnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. But this year ? I do n't even remember when it is. 
Instead, the displaced are planning days of prayer.
 We 're living in a city that's like a cemetery, said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the quake. Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night.
 I had four good walls around me. Now I have four sheets, she said. She goes to work with a big, black faux-leather purse containing toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly.
 We do n't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way, she said. I am always stressed. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival ? 
Baduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing.
Nearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal.
They played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance. Now, everything was gone, - including all their instruments that were crushed when band coordinator Ernst Beauvaishouse collapsed.
A small stage emblazoned with the red and white logo of Relax Band now harbors a massive water bladder tank dropped off by an aid group and a few mattresses for slumber under the stars.
 It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country, Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house. He said it was the street band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showcasing their new song. Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival.
On the outskirts of town, the skeletons of three floats sit like ghosts, reminders of what might have come next week.
One of the floats belongs to T-Vice.
Bandmates Roberto Martino and Eddy Viau would have been practicing with the rest of the band for their Carnival performance - -- it's an honor to win top prize.
 If you have a good showing at Carnival, you 're set for the rest of the year, Martino said. This year, the band had planned a soccer-themed show with a song called The End of the Match. 
Instead it recently released Nou Pap Lage -LRB- We Wo n't Give Up -RRB-, dedicated to the victims of the earthquake.
iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti
Martino tried to sing a few verses. There are so many things going through my head, he said. Overcome by emotion, he had to compose himself and start again.
 People are saying Haiti is finished, but no, no, no, we will rise up, he sang softly. We will strive. We will rebuild Haiti. We will stand united. 
 Do n't be discouraged. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. My Haitian people. I will not let go. 
Proceeds from downloads of the song are going to the nonprofit organizations Sow A Seed and MedShare. Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life. But he did n't know when this rare silence would end; when he would be able to write lyrics, put them to melody.
 We 're all so traumatized, he said. Carnival, he said, was Haiti's musical showcase. We 've lost our biggest tradition. Carnival was part of us.

"On one of New York City's most famous avenues, Fifth Avenue, is Museum Mile. Museum Mile is a 23-block stretch that holds some of the most famous museums in the world. Museum Mile begins at 85th Street and Fifth Avenue with the massive Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inside is thousands of years worth of art and artifacts. A visitor can visit an entire Egyptian tomb, sit in a Japanese style garden, view Renaissance paintings, and ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There is even a gallery featuring musical instruments. In the summer, there is a rooftop garden where there are spectacular views of the city, especially of Central Park.
 
The Guggenheim, on 88th Street and Fifth Avenue, looks a little bit like a snail's shell from the outside. When it opened in the 1950's, the swirling architecture, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was thought to be ugly by many. This museum focuses on modern art, but sometimes features special exhibits like one they had a few years ago of ancient Mexican ruins. The National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts on 91st Street and Fifth Avenue is the city's oldest art school, dating back to 1825. The Jewish Museum on 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, tells 4,000 years worth of Jewish History. Up ten blocks on 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue is the Museum of the City of New York, showcasing the history of the Big Apple from its colonial start.

Now it features exhibits focusing on art from all over Latin America. Across the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has a sculpture of three dancing life-size women.",B2
"The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in ""inhumane"" conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C. 
Dancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first-round match against France's Benoit Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park and passed out for a minute, said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players. He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: ""I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy - that's weird.'"" 
""I think it's inhumane. I don't think it's fair to anybody - to the players, to the fans, to the sport - when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,"" he added. ""I've played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, it's not normal. 
""Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it's too hot to play; until somebody dies, they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. I, personally, don't think it's fair and I know a lot of players don't think it's fair."" 
Other players were in broad agreement. The British number one, Andy Murray, said: ""It's definitely something that you have to look at a little bit. As much as it's easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That's not great. 
""I know when I went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.30-3pm were very, very tough. Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. There's been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks."" 
Caroline Wozniacki said: ""I put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. So, you know it was warm."" 
John Isner, who retired from his first-round match with a right ankle injury, said: ""It was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are done. That's what it's like."" 
The defending champion Victoria Azarenka took the same line. ""It felt pretty hot, like you're dancing in a frying pan or something like that,"" she said. 
The tournament's ""extreme heat"" contingency plan was put into force for women's matches on Tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets. Under a change to the rules for 2014, however, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen. Rather than use the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat, organizers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite, which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions. Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped. ""We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time,"" McKewen said in a statement. ""That didn't happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue."" 
Dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, ended up losing 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. ""I was really close to stopping completely,"" he said. ""I wasn't really running too much towards the end. I wasn't tired; I just felt my body temperature was too high."" 
A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonic's 7-6, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts. China's Peng Shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 defeat to Japan's Kurumi Nara. Officials played down health risks, saying the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention. 
""Of course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match,"" Tim Wood, the tournament's chief medical officer, said in a statement. 
Most competitors, though, followed Roger Federer's line that, although conditions were tough, they were the same for both players. ""It's just a mental thing,"" the Swiss said, albeit before Dancevic collapsed. ""If you've trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there's no reason. If you can't deal with it, you throw in the towel."" 
Dancevic disagreed. ""I don't think it's much to do with the shape the players are in. Some players are used to the heat - their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others' can't,"" he said. ""It's hazardous to be out there; it's dangerous. It's an hour and a half since my match and I still can't pee.""

"The roof is plastic held up by a crooked tree trunk and the desks just a jumble of cast-off chairs, but the students inside the Chemin des Dunes school are studying with the same intensity you would find in a seminar at Oxford University. At stake is the hope of a new life in France. 
""The French language is very difficult but we try hard. If we come every day, maybe we can touch our dreams,"" says Kamal, a refugee from Sudan's war-torn Darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day. ""It's a good thing to keep your brain active."" 
The 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of refugees living in the ""jungle"" camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France and are eager to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home. 
Like many of his fellow students, he is frustrated that media coverage of the sprawling tent-village has focused only on those who use it as a staging post for risky nightly bids to sneak on board cross-Channel lorries or trains. 
""I need to tell people in the UK, they think that everyone wants to go there. But there are a lot of people here who want to stay in France,"" Kamal said. 
France is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees, according to United Nations data - the country has taken in more than twice as many as the UK, even though the countries have similar populations. 
There are a further 56,000 asylum seekers waiting for their claim to a French safe haven to be processed - the second highest number in Europe - while, in the UK, there are 36,000. 
While the applicants wait for an answer, though, France does not provide them with any financial support or allow them to work - and the slow process can take many months. The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads so many decide to endure the basic conditions for a few extra months, rather than potentially jeopardize their asylum bid by working illegally. 
The idea for the school was first touted by some of that group at the start of the summer, when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate. It was a reality within weeks, opening on 11 July. 
""We did it to reunite the 'brothers' and, at the same time, they can learn French,"" said Zimarco Jones, the school's Nigerian founder, who arrived in Calais in 2013 and is still waiting for his asylum claim to be processed. ""Now, we need to build another one,"" he says with a grin. 
At its busiest, the tiny classroom holds 30 pupils, crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet. There are also classes in English, art and t'ai chi but the biggest draw is the French lessons, provided by volunteers from Calais and beyond. 
""French is not as easy as English but, two weeks ago, I decided there was no way to get to the UK,"" says George, another Darfur refugee and dedicated student. He wanted to cross the Channel because he speaks fluent English but, with language classes, he says he is happy to settle in France. 
""Anywhere there is peace, I can stay, no problem,"" he says, already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive. 
He admits he doesn't know much about France but says that the classes are slowly helping him understand the country as well as the language. 
Many of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays. 
Jenny Flahaut, 33, who works at a children's home, was inspired to volunteer after seeing an advertisement on Facebook. ""I saw these people in Calais every day and I wanted to do something for them,"" she said. 
She is particularly frustrated by the depiction of migrants in the media and by politicians who have never visited the camp, most recently David Cameron, the British prime minister, who in a much criticized speech talked about ""swarms"" of people trying to reach the UK. 
""They don't know them and have a bad vision but they are not like that,"" Flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson. ""Most of them are very good people. They are welcoming and friendly. They want to improve their life and make it better, and learning is part of that."" 
The teachers and Zimarco are focused, now, on setting up a separate classroom to serve around 200 women and two dozen children. The women are outnumbered around ten to one by men in the Calais encampment and most feel uncomfortable attending classes with male students they don't know, the volunteers say. 
When that is finished, the former hotel worker whose work getting the school off the ground is remembered in its unofficial name - everyone in the camp just calls it ""Zimarco's school"" - has more dreams for making the camp a place to live, not just survive. He wants to set up a football team for migrants, he explains over an instant cappuccino in the immaculate tent he calls home, and even dreams of changing the camp name. He hates ""the jungle"" because he says it implies the residents aren't people. 
""We have a discotheque, a house, a mosque, a school, shops,"" he says. ""We are not animals.""

"The principal of a local college has asked you to write a report on the advantages and disadvantages of working abroad in the summer holidays. She would like to know if the college should recommend 'working holidays' to its students.
A report on students' experiences of working abroad
Introduction
Currently, approximately 25 per cent of Hawthorne College students work abroad during the summer break. This report aims to show the benefits and drawbacks of working overseas in order to decide whether the college should recommend the experience to its students.
To prepare for this report, a sample of 100 students were interviewed, 23 of whom had worked abroad. This is a summary of their comments.
Benefits
According to the students interviewed, working overseas during the summer holidays can bring several benefits. Most of all, students can improve their foreign language skills by working in a non-English speaking country. This may help them get a better job in the future. Additionally, learning about a different culture and way of life makes people more open-minded. A further advantage is that students may become more confident when they learn practical skills to help them live independently later in life, for example, finding accommodation and cooking for themselves.
Drawbacks
However, a large number of interviewees mentioned drawbacks as well. Students who need to study over the summer will find it difficult to do so while working abroad. Most significant of all are finance issues: only a minority of students are able to afford travel expenses, accommodation and visas. In addition, students may have to take low-income jobs if they are not fluent in the local language, so they may struggle to cover their expenses.
Conclusion and recommendation
Working abroad may improve students' language skills and confidence. However, students often need to earn money during the holidays to support their studies and working abroad may not provide the opportunity to save. Also, the cost of travel means that only students who are able to afford it have the chance to do this. Therefore, the college should only recommend working abroad if there is financial support from the college for students that need it.",B2
"An atmosphere of melancholy and changing times pervades the opening to the final series of Downton Abbey. The year is 1925 and there are already the first rumblings of the economic storms that will blight the end of the decade. The neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while Lord Grantham seeks to cut back on servants after declaring that under-butlers are no longer affordable. 
But at the real Downton Abbey, Highclere Castle - a stately home owned by George ""Geordie"" Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon - the financial outlook has rarely been brighter. According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon, the huge global success of Downton has funded a rolling programme of building repairs aimed at safeguarding Highclere for the next generation. 
""It's been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,"" she said. ""It's given us a wonderful marketing platform, an international profile. I'm hugely grateful. My husband and I love the house, and the people here. Now, without doubt, it is loved by millions of other people."" 
Currently, only the ground and first floors of Highclere, on the borders of Hampshire, are used. But, a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842. 
When the Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009, the family faced a near GBP12m repair bill, with urgent work priced at GBP1.8m. But, by 2012, the Downton effect had begun to take the pressure off. Lord Carnarvon said then: ""It was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions. We had been doing corporate functions but it all became pretty sparse after that. Then, Downton came along and it became a major tourist attraction."" 
Visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as Downton Abbey, scripted by Julian Fellowes, came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and, then, in the US. It is now broadcast in 250 countries. The formerly somewhat basic ticketing policy has become a computerized advance booking system, helping to guarantee foreign visitors admission. The accounts of Highclere Enterprises for 2014-15 show current assets have almost trebled to around GBP1m since 2012. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the series, said: ""I think Downton Abbey secured Highclere's future."" 
Peter Fincham, ITV's director of television, recalls the moment when Highclere was booked. ""I thought, 'So what?', because I had never heard of Highclere Castle. One stately home looks much the same as another. How wrong I was. The castle has been one enormous character as well."" 
The Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, include castles and historic houses on their itineraries. Almost half of potential visitors to Britain now say they want to indulge in ""set jetting "", visiting places featured in films or on TV. More than a million embark on a tour of historic buildings each year, spending in excess of GBP1bn. From the biggest emerging tourist markets, 51% of Brazilians, 42% of Russians and Chinese, and 35% of Indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips. VisitBritain's director, Patricia Yates, said: ""The links between tourism, films and TV are potent ones."" She added that period dramas have also raised the popularity of regions outside of London. 
Neame is now an ambassador for the GREAT Britain campaign, which is backed by government departments and the British Council, using it to promote the UK around the world. Events include special Downton -themed receptions at British embassies. 
Neame said: ""They approached me because of the reach. A lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment. In other parts of the world, people revere our actors, our writing and production talent. It is something I am passionate about; I am a really strong believer in soft power. We are not nearly as proud of our achievements as we should be. 
""Downton Abbey is iconic for expressing Britishness. Really, it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. It's the first TV period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture."" 
Lady Carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the long-term future of Highclere is not necessarily secure. ""The bottom line is quite thin,"" she said. ""The programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings, have the follies restored."" 
In the pipeline is a Tutankhamun centenary event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, together with Howard Carter, discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of Egyptology. Another opportunity to keep Highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot ""Capability"" Brown, who designed the grounds. 
""What you do is never sit on your laurels. Every single day, don't take anything for granted,"" said Lady Carnarvon. ""For all these great houses, you have to invest in them. And, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. Perhaps, in the past, an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how Geordie and I seek to support and look after Highclere. 
""From my point of view, I've tried to persuade people it is fun and have specific events they can engage with, not just a wander around a dusty house. We have to compete with attractions like the London Dungeon.""

"""Look up in the sky! It's a bird; it's a plane. No. It's Superman!"" This is one of the most iconic lines in television history. It signaled the beginning of a new episode of The Adventures of Superman. The 1960s show is just one in a series of shows, plays, movies, and comic books that depict the ""Man of Steel."" The most iconic actor portraying Superman was Christopher Reeve. Reeve starred in four movies during the late 1970s and 80s.
 
In the 1978 movie classic Superman, Reeve was cast as the legendary American hero based largely on his physical attributes, although he was an accomplished actor. Reeve had the classic Superman look. He was 6'4"" tall, weighed 215 lbs., with a square jaw, and other manly features that made him perfect for the role. The film won critical acclaim, and multiple awards, including a ""Special Achievement Award for Visual Effects."" One of the selling points for the movie was that the special effects were so good that audience would believe that a man can fly after seeing this film.
Reeve went on to star in three sequels to the original movie, and had a very solid acting career in several movies after that. Tragically, Reeve and his family were hit with a devastating blow on May 27, 1995. Reeve was riding his horse through a steeplechase course jumping over obstacles. His horse suddenly stopped, throwing Reeve to the ground. Reeve suffered shattered vertebrae, and instantly lost the use of his arms and legs.
Reeve refused to give up. He spent the rest of his years advocating for spinal cord injury advancement in treatment and technology. He used his celebrity status to help the cause, but sadly, Reeve died at the age of 52 in 2004 due to complications from his injuries. He will always be remembered to his fans as the Man of Steel though.",B2
"Before there was a Tea Party, there was Mary Rakovich.
Rakovich is an anti-abortion rights, pro-environment vegetarian living in Florida with her husband and nine cats.
Many Tea Party activists believe she was one of the first people to publicly protest President Obama's economic policies.
In February 2009, Obama was in a Fort Myers, Florida, event hall pitching his stimulus plan. Rakovich stood alone outside the hall, speaking against it. For that, she is considered to be a sort of Godmother of the Tea Party movement.
Nine days after Rakovich's protest, CNBC business reporter Rick Santelli publicly mounted his own campaign against the president's $75 billion plan to help struggling homeowners. It happened as Santelli reported live from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on February 19, 2009.
 The government is promoting bad behavior, he said in a tirade, claiming that all Americans would be forced to subsidize the losersmortgages. 
The stimulus bill had nothing to do with job creation whatsoever, Rakovich said in an interview with CNN last summer.
And though she rails against government spending, Rakovich relies on one of the biggest spending programs, Medicare, to care for her two bad hips.
 I do believe that there are times when we need the government to have some type of stopgap measures to help get people back on their feet, Rakovich said. Those types of people need help. I also believe that as an overall system, that Medicare, as well as Medicaid, they 're broken systems -- they are systems that need to be revived and revamped. 
 You know, I 'm very glad that it was there for me and will be there for me.

"Andy Murray's first match since undergoing back surgery in September ended in a straight sets defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi Thursday.
The reigning Wimbledon champion went down 7-5 6-3 to the Frenchman, who himself was plagued by injury at the back end of this year.
Murray, who has dropped to No. 4 in the rankings, lacked sharpness after his layoff and was broken in the 12th game of the opening set to fall behind.
The British star has been training at his base in Florida to prepare for the upcoming season and looked set to even the match up when he gained an early break of service in the second set.
But Tsonga hit back with two breaks of his own to wrap up victory in 72 minutes at the Zayed Sports City complex.
 The courts here are very fast and you have to react quickly, said 26-year-old Murray.
 Jo was sharper than me today, he served very well.
 It's always good fun here. It's great preparation for the season as you have to play against the best in the world. 
The organizers of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship have indeed attracted a stellar field with the top two ranked players, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, in the line-up.
David Ferrer of Spain won the opening match Thursday as he beat Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland 7-5 6-1 to set up a semifinal clash against compatriot Nadal.
Tsonga's win over Murray has earned him a match against Serbia's Djokovic, while Murray will gain much-needed match practice against Wawrinka in the fifth place playoff.
Murray, recently voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year back in the UK, became the first British man to win the Wimbledon title in 77 years when he triumphed at the All England Club back in July, but his season took a turn for the worse as he became troubled by a long-standing back problem.

"The White House Wednesday said it was puzzled by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth.
Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book.
In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war. 
 -LSB- I -RSB- n this regard, he was terribly ill-served by his top advisers, especially those involved directly in national security, McClellan wrote.
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time at the White House sad. Read excerpts from the book 
 Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House, Perino said. For those of us who fully supported him, before, during and after he was press secretary, we are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew. 
McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book.
Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to Bush, said advisers to the president should speak up when they have policy concerns.
 Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues, said Townsend, now a CNN contributor. For him to do this now strikes me as self-serving, disingenuous and unprofessional. 
Fox News contributor and former White House adviser Karl Rove said on that network Tuesday that the excerpts from the book he's read sound more like they were written by a left-wing blogger than his former colleague.
Rove declined to comment to CNN after the Fox News interview.
In a brief phone conversation with CNN Tuesday evening, McClellan made clear that he stands behind the accuracy of his book. McClellan said he can not give on-the-record quotes yet because of an agreement with his publisher. Watch further details emerge from McClellan's book 
Another former Bush aide-turned-critic says the reaction to McClellan's book by his former colleagues has a familiar ring to it.
 They 're saying some of the exact same things about McClellan they said about me, Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief, told CNN.
Clarke left government in 2003. The following year, he accused President Bush of ignoring warnings about the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and of using the attacks to push for war with Iraq.
But Clarke gave McClellan little credit for speaking out now.
 I think the difference with McClellan's book is he's now telling us something we all know -- that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war -LSB- and -RSB- was sold with deception. It's a little different when you say something as I did and a few other people did four or five years ago, when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said. 
Besides his criticism of how the administration handled the run-up to the Iraq war, McClellan also sharply criticizes the administration on its handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in the book.
 One of the worst disasters in our nation's history became one of the biggest disasters in Bush's presidency, he wrote. Katrina and the botched federal response to it would largely come to define Bush's second term. 
Early in the book, which CNN obtained late Tuesday, McClellan wrote that he believes he told untruths on Bush's behalf in the case of CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose identity was leaked to the media.
Rove and fellow White House advisers Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis Scooter Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame -- whose husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, had gone public with charges the Bush administration had twisted facts to justify the war in Iraq.
Libby was convicted last year of lying to a grand jury and federal agents investigating the leak. Bush commuted his 30-month prison term, calling it excessive. At the time, McClellan called the three good individuals and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved.
 I had allowed myself to be deceived into unknowingly passing along a falsehood, he wrote. It would ultimately prove fatal to my ability to serve the president effectively. 
McClellan wrote he did n't realize what he said was untrue until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later.
A former spokesman for Bush when he was governor of Texas, McClellan was named White House press secretary in 2003, replacing Ari Fleischer. McClellan had previously been a deputy press secretary and was the traveling spokesman for the Bush campaign during the 2000 election.
He announced he was resigning in April 2006 at a news conference with Bush.
 One of these days, he and I are going to be rocking in chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as the press secretary, Bush said at that conference. And I can assure you, I will feel the same way then that I feel now, that I can say to Scott, job well done.

"Even in death, peace seemed to elude little Myls Dobson.
On Wednesday evening, one week after the badly beaten and burned boy was found in the apartment of the woman caring for him, his body was claimed at the morgue in New York.
Authorities said the boy was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the bathroom at The Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital.
Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
She has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment. A prosecutor told the court last week that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder and faced additional charges. The indictment will be unsealed February 5.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her. I would tell everyone not jump to any conclusions at this time. On Wednesday, Konoski did not return a call seeking comment.
Mylsfather, Okee Wade, who has a lengthy arrest record, was jailed in New Jersey on conspiracy, theft and money laundering charges just days after dropping his son off with King in mid-December, authorities said. He pleaded not guilty.
The boy's mother, Ashlee Dobson, who faced abuse and neglect charges in both South Carolina and New York City before ultimately losing custody of Myls in 2011, plans a memorial service for her son in Harlem on Tuesday night.
 We 're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect, said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
In the final weeks of his brief life, Myls suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence, according to a criminal complaint.
The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object on his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consistent with being restrained -- lacerations to his fingers, abrasions to his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
King told police that Mylsfather dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the child's primary and sole caretaker until the time of his death, the complaint said.
At a news conference Friday, Herbert said that Dobson lost custody of her son for financial reasons. Herbert and Dobson demanded answers from child welfare authorities.
 The city of New York put the child in the care of the father, who they knew was a felon, Herbert said. You open up a case and then you close it thinking everything is fine ? No. That has to be answered. Who did that, who authorized that ? 
Referring to child welfare authorities, he added, She was in a shelter, they did n't think it best that she would be in that shelter with a baby, so they gave him to the father. 
David Bookstaver, a family court spokesman, said Wednesday that the mother's financial straits or stay at a shelter had nothing to do with her losing custody of the child.
 The record reflected serious mental health issues that would have prevented her from properly caring for the young boy, he said. In fact, she consented to have the father be Mylscustodian, as did the child's lawyer and the Administration for Children's Services. 
At the New York family court hearing, it was mentioned that Ashlee Dobson was arrested after an emergency room nurse at a South Carolina hospital spotted lacerations on the boy and called the police, according to an April 8, 2011, police report from the Colleton County Sheriff's Office.
She told police the injuries happened when Myls ran into traffic in the parking lot of a supermarket. She claimed she scratched the boy when she grabbed him and then fell on top of him, the report said.
 When they got up she stated that she slapped the child with a closed fist on his face because she was mad, the report said.
Dobson told police that Myls later fell down stairs and struck his head. Philip Lights, Dobson's lawyer, said the case was later dismissed after his client agreed to counseling and treatment under the supervision of child welfare authorities.
Last week, Dobson told reporters that she was turning her life around in hopes of regaining custody of her son. She had weekly visitation rights but last saw her son in November.
In tears, she said, I love my son. He always loved me. He always gave me kisses. 
The complaint portrays the finals weeks of Mylslife as a living hell.
King, the baby-sitter, told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said. The next day, she told police, she allegedly struck him about his body five or six times with a belt, leaving bruises and scars.
The complaint said King admitted that from December 30 to January 4, she allegedly tied the boy's wrists and feet together with shoe laces and gagged him with a piece of cloth. She told police that treatment resulted in scaring on his wrists and ankles. On the day she freed him, the complaint said, King allegedly beat him 12 to 13 times with a belt.
On January 7, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said. That same day, she allegedly locked the boy inside a dark bathroom for about three hours.
King told authorities that the boy was being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food, the complaint said. The last time the boy ate or drank anything was on January 3.
Aside from her comments about the child not eating well, King gave no indication in the complaint of what might have prompted her purported actions.
After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office, said an autopsy was performed Thursday, but the cause of death is pending further study.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called Mylsdeath tragic and ordered a full report on what happened by the end of this week.
 Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop, he said. And god forbid when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to every time do better so we can reach more children.

"Some of the most majestic landscape views in California are the great California Redwood and Sequoia trees. These trees can be seen up close at Sequoia National Park in the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range, of Visalia. This central California region boasts more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian. The park is known as the Land of the Giants because of its beautiful trees. The landscape features great mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a large cavern system, and, of course, the world's largest trees.
 
The park sits side by side with King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in the 1890s. It features 14 campsites that include picnic tables, fire rings for outdoor cooking, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family vacation with many of its campsites open year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests. The ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on earth, and draw millions of visitors worldwide. Redwood trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They are closely related to the Giant Sequoia trees, and are often mistaken for each other. They both are uniquely Californian, as they do not grow naturally in any other region in the world.
Redwood trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The Giant Sequoia trees can live up to an astonishing 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its bark can grow to an amazing thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown bark, and look very similar, but the Redwood thrives in coastal climate, while the Sequoia exists in more mountainous areas. In either case, they are a must-see California attraction.",B2
"One of the most well-respected actors in Hollywood today is Tom Hanks. He is one of the most popular actors among American film, and television viewers. He has gained great success as a film actor, having starred in some of the greatest movies of his generation. He starred in films such as Splash, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, and Big.
 
Born in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks began his career in television in the popular TV show Bosom Buddies, where he plays a man living in a women's dormitory. In order to live among the women, he and his roommate must dress in women's clothing during the evening hours after arriving from work. This series ran for three years and made Hanks a legitimate star.
Hanks reached film stardom in Splash, which was a very popular love story involving Hanks as a frustrated bachelor, and a mermaid. The movie launched his film career that featured Hanks in mostly comedic roles. Hanks would probably always be known as a comedic actor if he did not star in his share of dramatic roles. He played a former baseball star in A League of their Own, and a romantic lead in the popular Sleepless in Seattle. In 1993, Hanks won an Academy Award for his portrayal as a displaced worker who gets fired from his job because he contracts AIDS in the film Philadelphia. He lost 35 lbs. for his role as the gay lawyer because he wanted to look sickly. Hanks followed his Oscar-winning performance in Philadelphia with a second Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Forrest Gump. He became only the second actor to win the award in consecutive years.
Tom Hanks has used his celebrity status to address several causes such as same-sex marriage, environmental issues, and the development of alternative fuels.",B2
"Just when cruise lines thought they might be headed for calmer waters...
At least 162 passengers and 11 crew members have reported being ill on board Princess CruisesCaribbean Princess, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The institute said health officers would board the ship in Houston to investigate the gastrointestinal illness, which is causing vomiting and diarrhea.
The news follows reports of sickness this week on another cruise ship, this one from the Royal Caribbean line.
Nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill aboard the Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades, CDC data show.
That ship returned home Wednesday, two days earlier than expected.
To compare the cruises, 5.22 % of passengers on the Caribbean Princess reported being ill, versus 20.5 % on the Explorer of the Seas.
The outbreak on board the Caribbean Princess has been confirmed as norovirus, according to Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Princess Cruises.
Are cruise ships floating petri dishes ?
Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea.
Norovirus is also suspected on board the Explorer of the Seas, though the cause of the illness there has not been confirmed.
Caribbean Princess is expected in Houston early Friday. The seven-day cruise is being cut short by one day.
Sick passengers are being asked to stay in their cabins, while staff disinfect public areas such as restrooms and elevators.
The decision to cut the trip short was made based on forecasts for heavy fog, not the outbreak, Benson said.
CNN first learned of the stricken Princess ship from a Twitter post by the Houston Chronicle.

"Paul Walker's brothers are helping fill in small gaps in Fast & Furious 7 action sequences not finished before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday.
Walker died in a fiery car crash during a Thanksgiving break in filming last November, forcing a halt to production.
 We had to take time to grieve Paul, the brother we love and lost, and to figure out if we should move on with our film, producers wrote to fans in a Facebook post Tuesday.
The decision to resume filming was the only choice, the note said. We believe our fans want that, and we believe Paul would want that, too. 
Walker's dramatic scenes were completed before his death but some action sequences were unfinished, they said.
 We have resumed shooting and now welcome Paul's brothers, Caleb and Cody, into our Fastfamily, the post said. Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining action for their brother and fill in small gaps left in production. Having them on set has made us all feel that Paul is with us, too. 
The movie was to have been released this summer, but Universal pushed it back to April 10, 2015.
 This film is the most important we 've ever done together, the post said. It will allow the character of Brian O'Conner to live on and let us celebrate Paul in his most defining role. 
Walker's O'Conner character is a staple of the long-running and hugely profitable film franchise.

Investigators concluded in a report released in March that speed was to blame in Walker's death.
 Investigators determined the cause of the fatal solo-vehicle collision was unsafe speed for the roadway conditions, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Commander Mike Parker said.
The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees, the final report said. The posted speed limit on the Santa Clarita, California, office park road was 45 mph.
Walker, 40, and friend Roger Rodas, 38, had no drugs or alcohol in their blood, the report said. Both men were wearing seat belts.
The airbags deployed as they should have when the car clipped a light pole and several trees, investigators said. Nothing mechanical went wrong to cause the Porsche to leave the wide road. Investigators found no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision, the report said.
Porsche Carrera GT: 5 reasons the car Paul Walker died in is different
Walker and Rodas, racing team partners, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street.

"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in Talbot County, Maryland in 1818. His exact birth date was lost to history. Many African slaves did not have their birth dates recorded into official records during that time period because they did not have basic human rights. They were considered property owned by their white masters. It was a dark time in the country. Frederick Douglass helped change that.
 
It was illegal in the southern states to educate blacks at that time, but Douglass was fortunate enough to have been educated by the wife of his master, who began teaching Douglass the alphabet when he was 12 years old. He continued his education on his own after that. With his new reading skills, Douglass began teaching other black slaves the New Testament. He had a sympathetic owner, who did not see any harm in this activity, but his neighbors did not see eye to eye with him. It wasn't long before the lessons ended, after violent measures were taken by the white community members.
Douglass eventually escaped slavery, and settled in the state of Massachusetts, where he began his struggle to end slavery. Douglass became one of the most influential people of his generation. He made powerful friends in the U.S. government. During one of his lecture tours in 1843, Douglass was nearly beaten to death by an angry mob, who did not agree with his message of abolition. He fled the country on a couple of occasions to avoid being put into a state of slavery again. While in Europe, Douglass spoke to enthusiastic crowds on the evils of slavery.

"There is no American sports celebrity is as controversial as Lance Armstrong. Armstrong enjoyed years of glory from adoring American public during his cycling career for nearly a decade. Between 1999 through 2005, Armstrong won the famous Tour de France road cycling event seven consecutive years. This is a feat that no other person in the history of the famed race has ever accomplished. He was an American hero who benefited greatly from his fame and fortune. During those years, no other athlete in the United States was more popular than Armstrong.
 
Armstrong was born in 1971 in Plano, Texas. By the age of 12, he had been competing in swimming competitions with great success. At 16, Armstrong began competing in the grueling triathlon races, where contestants must cycle, swim, and run for several miles. His Tour de France records were superior to any other racer in the history of the annual event, which began in 1903. However, Armstrong had a dark side.
After he retired from competition in 2011, allegations of drug use began to surface. The United States Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the cyclist, and eventually found he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his years competing in the Tour de France.
Armstrong denied any wrongdoing, but the USADA stripped him of his titles. He was also barred from ever competing professionally again. This was followed by a lifetime ban from the Union Cycliste Internationale, an international racing organization. Armstrong did not admit to using drugs until January, 2013 on the Oprah Winfrey Show. He claimed that he was not the only athlete using drugs on the tour, and that he was being singled out because of his success. However, that did not matter; this American hero had fallen.",B2
"Much has been said about Kim Kardashian in the weeks leading up to her wedding, and now the reality star is speaking for herself.
The 33-year-old opened up Wednesday on topics ranging from the truth about her wedding dress to racism.
For starters, she posted May 7, she and fiance Kanye West are n't married yet, despite speculation earlier in the week that the two had secured a marriage license.
They 're also not going to film their upcoming nuptials for E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  You will see everything leading up til and after ! Kardashian tweeted. As much as we would love to share these memories on camera, we 've decided to keep this close to our heart & share thru photos. 
There's also been chatter about who will and wo n't be coming to the Kardashian-West wedding -- People magazine has indicated that the Kardashian family will be there, but not West's pals Jay Z and Beyonce -- while others have gossiped about the details of Kardashian's wedding dress.
Yet according to the reality star, her fans should n't believe a word unless you hear it from us. 
 No guest list has been released. Seeing fake ones, she tweeted. Especially not 1600 people invited like I just read. -LRB- The wedding is -RRB- VERY small & intimate. And for that matter, she's seen fake wedding dress pics of me. No one has seen my dress ! Those photos are old or Photoshopped. 
After Kardashian got those wedding-related thoughts off her chest, she turned to a more serious matter: how being a mother of a mixed-race child has affected her understanding of racism.
In a blog post titled On My Mind, Kardashian spoke about how welcoming daughter North with West last June is like getting to see the world for the first time again, but through someone else's eyes. 
 It's amazing how one little person and the love I have for her has brought new meaning to every moment. What once seemed so important, now feels insignificant, she writes. To be honest, before I had North, I never really gave racism or discrimination a lot of thought. It is obviously a topic that Kanye is passionate about, but I guess it was easier for me to believe that it was someone else's battle. 
But with the arrival of her daughter, Kardashian says she's more aware of a side of life that is n't always so pretty. 
 I feel a responsibility as a mother, a public figure, a human being, to do what I can to make sure that not only my child, but all children, do n't have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin, or their gender, or their sexual orientation, Kardashian concluded. I want my daughter growing up in a world where love for one another is the most important thing.

"Evangelical pastor Ted Haggard described Thursday as fundamentally true an assertion that he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old male volunteer in 2006.
Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's Larry King Live that he had a second relationship with a man.
The incident occurred when the two men were in bed together, Grant Haas said in a videotaped interview played on CNN's Larry King Live. 
 He pretty much asked me if it was OK if he masturbated in front of me or masturbated in the bed next to me, Haas said. I told him no, it would make me really uncomfortable. But he grabbed a bottle of lotion and started masturbating. 
Haas added, -LRB- Haggard -RRB- used to say to me, You know what, Grant, you can become a man of God, and you can have a little bit of fun on the side. 
Haggard, 52, said the incident was an indicator of the compulsive behavior that ruled him at the time. However, he said he has been undergoing therapy during the two years since and working it out. Watch Haggard accuser speak out 
Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence.
Haggard initially admitted in interviews that he received a massage from Jones but denied having sex with him. He also said he bought methamphetamine, but threw it away instead of using it.
The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex. Watch Haggard address allegations on Oprah 
Haggard is the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which claims to represent millions of people in 45,000 congregations nationwide. He was also the head pastor at New Life Church.
In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement but who was not authorized to speak on the record.
In the CNN interview, Haggard credited Jones with having helped him by disclosing that information.
 I think he rescued me. I 'm very grateful to him, Haggard said. He said he would have lost the support of his wife of 30 years, Gail, and their five children and been a drug addict had he not been caught.
 I paid a heavy price. It was stupid, he said.
Haggard likened his struggles with his desires to the struggles faced by dieters who say, I 'm not going to eat todayand then they eat. 
 Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it does n't matter, Haggard told Larry King. I 'm guilty enough of so many things. 
He acknowledged that his actions were hypocritical, but said he could not control his urges.
 I felt like God's plan was for sexuality to be in a monogamous, heterosexual marriage, he said. I wanted that. But at the same time, I had these other things going on. 
Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that it did not. It actually made me worse, he said.
Haggard said that, for a time, he lost the ability to read the Scriptures and became suicidal. I think it was divine intervention that stopped me, he said.
Asked if he has engaged in inappropriate conduct with any other men, Haggard did not give a direct answer, saying only, I have thoroughly discussed all of my sexual history with my wife and my therapist and, to some degree, the family, and we think that's an appropriate boundary for that. 
Asked whether he considers himself bisexual or gay, Haggard said that different therapists have described him in different ways. The first said, You are a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.I was n't sure what that meant. 
His current therapist, he said, described him as a heterosexual with complications. 
Haggard said he has, at least, another year of therapy ahead of him.
 I think I 'm still deeply wounded and scarred and somewhat confused, he said. About other men, he added, I have thoughts from time to time, but not compelling thoughts. 
Nevertheless, he said, Today, I 'm 100 percent satisfied with my relationship with my wife, and I have no compelling things in my life toward others. 
He said he initially urged his wife to leave him, but she refused.
 I really do love this man, she told CNN when asked why she did not leave. But it was also her faith that led her to stick with the marriage, she said. The teaching of Jesus is that we forgive and that we love. 
She said the two had a great sexual relationship in our marriage... throughout marriage. 
Though the news of his unfaithfulness came as a shock, it was n't completely out of the blue, she said. I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts. I never knew that he acted on them. 
Marcus Haggard, the couple's 25-year-old son, said he, too, was shocked by the revelations, but was more disturbed to learn that his father had lied. Still, he said the news brought the family closer together.
 He had lived so long on a pedestal, Marcus Haggard said about his famous father. He seemed practically perfect. There was a sense of relief in the fact that we could connect with our dad. 
Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people. I do n't know that that would mean a pulpit, but certainly I 'd be interested in public speaking. 
His appearance Thursday coincided with the debut of an HBO documentary called The Trial of Ted Haggard.

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Craigslist reports about 80 million ads on its site each month, so even if you have n't met a stranger to buy or sell something online, chances are you know someone who has.
The overwhelming majority of transactions go smoothly, but the site has a history of being co-opted by criminals on occasion.
A couple from Georgia was traveling to a Craigslist transaction last month when they left their suburban Atlanta home in hopes of buying a 1966 Ford Mustang. They did everything right -- they went together, and they told their family they were going to the transaction.
Yet the bodies of Elrey Bud Runion, and his wife, June, were found January 26, police said. A South Georgia man has been charged with murder in their deaths.
In a separate incident Friday, two men in Georgia met a seller to purchase a dog. The seller drew a gun on them in an attempted robbery, but one of the buyers was carrying a handgun and fatally shot the seller, police said. The investigation is ongoing.
The recent incidents should remind those engaged in this type of online commerce that it pays to be vigilant. So what can you do to make sure you do n't fall prey to ne'er - do-wells next time you respond to an online ad ?
Philip Holloway is a law enforcement adviser and defense attorney with some tips on things you should remember when buying and selling goods online:
10. Do n't reveal personal information
Remember this is a business transaction, so never reveal Social Security numbers, home or business addresses or banking information.
9. Keep your cell phone close
Have a cell phone in your hand during the entire transaction and be ready to call 911 at the first sign of trouble.
8. Do n't use your personal email
Use an anonymous email address to communicate with the buyer or seller.
7. Disable caller ID
Disable caller ID when calling the buyer or seller on the phone. Most cell phone and landline carriers offer this by dialing * 67 before making the outgoing call.
6. Do n't pay in cash
Do not accept cash and do not offer to pay in cash. Use a cashier's check instead and make it a non-negotiable term of the transaction.
5. If it's a high-priced transaction, do it at a bank
The higher the price of the item involved, the higher the risk of the transaction. Conduct these transactions at a banking facility so a banking professional can confirm the funds have been delivered successfully.
4. Always meet during the day
Never conduct your transactions at night.
3. Never meet at home
Find a neutral site to meet -- never at your or someone else's home.
2. Tell someone
Tell a trusted friend or family member what you 're doing and have another trusted friend or family member accompany you to the transaction.
1. Always meet in a public place
Most police departments will be happy to accommodate you, and they are open 24/7.

"President Obama will place tariffs on imports of some Chinese tires for three years in an effort to curb a surge in exports that has rocked the U.S. tire industry.
The White House announced plans to impose tariffs on some tires entering the United States from China.
The new tariffs will be on passenger car and light truck tires, the White House said in a statement Friday night.
 The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case, the statement said.
The tariffs will start at 35 percent in the first year, then would decline to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third.
Chinese leaders have in the past expressed displeasure about a possible tire tariff.
 We hope the U.S. government will refrain from taking action, for the long-term healthy and stable development of U.S.-Chinese relations, Fu Ziying, China's vice commerce minister, told local media in August.
 The case is neither supported by facts nor does it have valid legal grounds, he added.

"There are many law enforcement agencies in the United States, and especially in California. Some of the largest agencies in Southern California are the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Both of these police forces are some of the largest in the country. They handle a full-range of police duties ranging from traffic citations to murder, rape, and robbery cases. There are also a number of smaller police agencies operating side by side with the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own police force, while smaller cities depend on the Sheriff's Department for their law enforcement needs. Because of the unique nature of the state, California created the California Highway Patrol.
 
The CHP, as it is usually called, is a police agency that is entrusted with patrolling the vast number of freeway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a time of great mobility after the advent of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the state has more freeway miles than any other states in the United States with the exception of Texas. However, California has the most licensed drivers, and by far, the most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to its highways.
CHP officers are endowed with the same powers other police officers have. However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any offense other than traffic-related crimes. Whenever the CHP first responds to a crime that is not traffic-related, its officers perform the same duties a regular officer does. It then turns investigations over to the LAPD, or Sheriff's office depending on the location of the crime. The CHP has a long, and storied history. Many young Californians, both male and female, are attracted to the CHP, and enroll into its academy in Sacramento, the state's capital.",B2
"-LRB- CNN -RRB- A Minneapolis police officer was shot Saturday morning, and Police Chief Janee Harteau said there is little doubt that an officer was the intended target. 
The wounded officer was one of two who had just finished responding to a reported burglary when he was shot just before 5 a.m. -LRB- 6 a.m. ET -RRB-, Minneapolis police said in a statement. His partner promptly drove him to North Memorial Medical Center.
Assistant Police Chief Matt Clark told reporters Saturday afternoon that the officer, who was standing outside his car, was doing well and is in fair condition. 
A man was arrested in connection with the burglary and a reported domestic assault, Clark said. Police took 43-year-old Andrew Neal, who is suspected of violating his probation, into custody.
Detectives are investigating whether there is a link between the domestic violence report, the burglary and the shooting, the assistant chief said.
A woman who reported the alleged assault was cooperating with authorities. She gave us a lot of information -LRB- about the incident and the burglary -RRB-, he said.
Police believe the wounded officer was n't targeted personally, but was shot simply because he is a police officer, police spokesman Scott Seroka added.
According to Harteau, he just happened to be the one who was there. 
 This is a reminder to all that every one of our officers face such danger simply because they choose to wear a uniform, Harteau said. They deserve our support and gratitude. 
The officer who was shot is well-respected by co-workers and does an excellent job, Clark said.

"There comes a time in some men's lives when the days seem darker, mortality more certain, and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar. 
Radical and often ill-advised changes in lifestyle have become the calling cards of the midlife crisis but, if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it. 
Now an international team of scientists claims to have found evidence for a slump in well- being among middle-aged chimpanzees and orangutans. The lull in happiness in the middle years, they say, is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis. 
The study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has raised eyebrows among some scientists but, according to the authors, the findings suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins. 
""There's a common understanding that there's a dip in well-being in middle age,"" Alex Weiss, a psychologist at Edinburgh University, told the Guardian. 
""We took a step back and asked whether it's possible that instead of the midlife crisis being human-specific, and driven only by social factors, it reflects some evolved tendency for middle-aged individuals to have lower well-being,"" he said. 
The team from the US, Japan, Germany and the UK asked zookeepers, carers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals. 
The forms included questions about each ape's mood, the enjoyment they gained from socializing, and their success at achieving certain goals. The final question asked how carers would feel about being the ape for a week. They scored their answers from one to seven. 
More than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups. The first two groups were chimpanzees, with the third made up of orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo. The animals came from zoos, sanctuaries and research centres in the US, Australia, Japan, Canada and Singapore. 
When the researchers analyzed the questionnaires, they found that well-being in the apes fell in middle age and climbed again as the animals moved into old age. In captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. The nadir in the animals' well-being occurred, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans. 
""In all three groups we find evidence that well-being is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that roughly corresponds to midlife in humans,"" Weiss said. ""On average, well-being scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old."" 
The team explains that the temporary fall in ape well-being may result from watching depressed apes dying younger, or through age-related changes in the brain that are mirrored in humans. Weiss conceded that, unlike men, apes are not known to pursue radical and often disastrous lifestyle changes in middle age. 
Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, was dubious about the findings. ""What can produce a sense of well-being or contentedness that varies across the lifespan like this? It's hard to see anything in an ape's life that would have that sort of pattern, that they would think about. They're not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future; that's one of the big differences between them and us."" Alexandra Freund, Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich, was also sceptical. She said the concept of a midlife crisis was shaky even in humans. ""In my reading of the literature, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis. If there's any indication of decline in emotional or subjective well-being it is very small and, in many studies, it's not there at all."" 
But Weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. ""If we want to find the answer as to what's going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,"" he said.

"It is very common to see homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles. This is a problem that has persisted in the city since the beginning of the 20th century. Back in that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in farming, and many young men were hopping on trains from all over the country to arrive in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up finding themselves without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many churches began to establish shelters in the area of Los Angeles that would eventually become Downtown. Even as the farm landscape changed to a big city environment, these shelters remained a refuge for many individuals that found themselves homeless
 
Nowadays, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than just young men looking for work. Many economic and social changes have resulted in both men and women of all ages turning to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them moneyless and jobless. Others are veterans from various wars that cannot find the resources to get back to their normal lives. Additionally, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities that limit them from finding a job or being accepted in the rest of society.
Since there are a lot of different causes that lead to homelessness, it is easy to see why finding solutions to helping all of the homeless people is so difficult. Although there are many programs that focus on providing the homeless food daily, it is much harder to find programs that try to assist the homeless in finding jobs, and stable housing. In order to finally find a solution that will effectively help decrease the number of homeless people in the city, a lot more individualized attention must be placed on individuals based on their physical and mental health, and circumstance.",B2
"Sir Alex Ferguson will retire as Manchester United manager at the end of the season in the 27th year of a tenure that has made him the most successful manager in British football. While he will become a United director and ambassador, the club will now have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, the Cup Winners' Cup, five FA Cups and four League Cups. 
Regarding his decision, Ferguson said: ""The decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly. It is the right time. It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so. The quality of this league-winning squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level whilst the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one. 
""Our training facilities are amongst the finest in global sport and our home, Old Trafford, is rightfully regarded as one of the leading venues in the world. Going forward, I am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club. With these activities, along with my many other interests, I am looking forward to the future. I must pay tribute to my family; their love and support has been essential. My wife, Cathy, has been the key figure throughout my career, providing a bedrock of both stability and encouragement. Words are not enough to express what this has meant to me. 
""As for my players and staff, past and present, I would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. Without their contribution, the history of this great club would not be as rich. In my early years, the backing of the board, and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, rather than just a football team. 
""Over the past decade, the Glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage Manchester United to the best of my ability and 
I have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive in David Gill. I am truly grateful to all of them. To the fans, thank you. The support you have provided over the years has been truly humbling. It has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and I have treasured my time as manager of Manchester United."" 
The sudden nature of Ferguson's departure is in keeping with how the Scot stated he would leave the post after he mentioned a first retirement during the 2001/2 season before performing a U-turn. It is understood he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training on Wednesday morning. In an emotional speech, he announced he was to step down. He then took his backroom staff aside before finally addressing the rest of the staff in the canteen. 
Joel Glazer, joint owner of Manchester United, said: ""Alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he's also a wonderful person. His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable. I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow."" 
Avie Glazer, his brother, said: ""I am delighted to announce that Alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. His contributions to Manchester United over the last 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all United fans, I want him to be a part of its future."" 
David Gill, the outgoing chief executive, said: ""I've had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with Alex for 16 unforgettable years - through the treble, the double, countless trophy wins and numerous signings. We knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first-class condition. Alex's vision, energy and ability have built teams - both on and off the pitch - that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport. 
""The way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that I admire. It is a side to him that is often hidden from public view but it is something that I have been privileged to witness in the last 16 years. 
What he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend."" 
First-team coach Rene Meulensteen revealed how Ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff on Wednesday morning. ""I found out this morning when I came to the club,"" he said. ""He called us into his office and told us what decision he had taken. It's always been on the cards - there's speculation every season. I think the manager kept his cards close to his chest. I think he felt the time was right now and he made a decision. 
""He's obviously a man who thinks very, very hard so I'm sure he's put a lot of thought into making this decision. I wish him well. He's been fantastic for this club and I hope all the fans give whoever's going to come in the same support that he gets.""",B2
"One of the most significant dates in the history of the United States is November 22, 1963. That is the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas while riding in an open-air car. The president was visiting Texas for the first time since his inauguration in January, 1961. Kennedy was one of the most popular presidents in the history of the United States, and still remains so today. His death shocked the nation for several reasons, but mostly because it was televised on a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time when most Americans owned a TV. He was not the first president to be televised, but previous presidents who appeared on TV did not reach the general public because before 1960, not many Americans owned a set.
 
Kennedy was warned not to ride in an open-air car that day by his bodyguards, but he wanted the public to see him live. He did not want to be hidden behind an armored car. According to the official government commission, Kennedy fell victim to a single assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that finding to this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy rode in his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time as the city of Dallas welcomed the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome, young president who was the youngest man ever to reach the presidency.
Oswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene, but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an outraged public, and was held in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former member of the U.S. military, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but never admitted to being the assassin. Conspiracy theories involving rival political parties, the Cuban government, and organized crime have also been advanced as to who actually killed Kennedy.",B2
"Lots of us know we are sleep-deprived but imagine if we could fix it with a fairly simple solution: getting up later. In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley, clinical research associate at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University, called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. It would improve cognitive performance, exam results and students' health (sleep deprivation has been linked with diabetes, depression, obesity and an impaired immune system). 
It follows a paper, published in 2014, in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am. The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds. For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later. ""A 7am alarm call for older adolescents,"" Kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper, ""is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s."" 
He says it's not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier. ""The body's natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,"" says Kelley. ""The eye doesn't just contain rods and cones; it contains cells that then report to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus."" This part of the brain controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. ""It's the light that controls it. It's like saying: 'Why can't you control your heartbeat?'"" 
But it isn't just students who would benefit from a later start. Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms. Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: ""Between 14 and 24, it's more than two hours. For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, it's about an hour and a half. That can continue up until you're about 55 when it's in balance again. The 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time."" 
This might be why, he adds, the traditional nine to five is so ingrained; it is maintained by bosses, many of them in their mid-50s and upwards because ""it is best for them"". So, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am? Kelley says that synchronized hours could have ""many positive consequences. The positive side of this is people's performance, mood and health will improve. It's very uplifting in a way because it's a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do."" 
There would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says. It could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and school-run times. A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, ""is something that would benefit everyone, particularly families. Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. It creates tensions for everybody."" 
So, what time does Kelley start work? ""I am 67 so that means I'm back to being ten years old and I get up just after six. I wake naturally."" And, yes, he says he finds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger.

"During the early part of the 20th Century, polio was considered one of the greatest health threats in the United States of America. Polio was a vicious disease that took its victim's lives, or left them with major disabilities. In 1952, the U.S. suffered one of its harshest epidemics of polio in its history. More than 58,000 cases of polio were reported that year, and 3,145 people lost their lives. Additionally, more than 21,000 people suffered some form of paralysis that ranged from mild paralysis to extreme cases where people became disabled. Dr. Jonas Salk is responsible for ending that plague.
 
Born in New York City on October 28, 1914, Jonas Salk grew up in modest surroundings. His parents were not wealthy, but they were able to put food on the table, and maintain a roof over their children's head. Salk demonstrated great academic success from childhood. By the age of 13, he was enrolled into a school for gifted children. He was considered a perfectionist by his peers, and succeeded academically in a very competitive environment. In college, Salk opted to go into medical school even though his mother wanted him to become an attorney. After graduating from medical school, Salk began his research on polio, which was considered a scourge of western society.
Polio had baffled medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th Century. When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that anyone could find an adequate cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in April of 1955, his accomplishment was heralded in newspapers across the country. Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the United States and many countries around the world.",B2
"Christmas, observed on December 25, is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. Christians of different denominations go to church on Christmas. Many Catholics go to midnight mass. In the United States, however, the holiday has a much more secular tone, and is celebrated throughout the country. Many people, regardless of their religion, put up and decorate a Christmas tree. The tree can be a real evergreen or it can be an artificial tree. Lights, strings, tinsel, and even popcorn can be used to decorate a Christmas tree. On the top of the tree is a star or an angel. The decorations are usually red and green.
 
The purpose of a Christmas tree is to have a central location to place gifts. According to legend, a jolly fat man with a beard, named Santa Claus, leaves presents under the tree. Children in the U.S. often write lists of things they want Santa to bring them. Many parents bring their children to shopping malls across the country to tell a man dressed as Santa what they want. These children are often also photographed with the mall Santa as a keepsake. On Christmas Eve many children leave milk and cookies for Santa. Of course it is the parents that buy the gifts from the wish lists, and even eat the cookies and drink the milk. On Christmas Day children usually wake up early and run to the tree so they can see what Santa brought them. Adults can also exchange gifts at this time.
People don't just decorate a tree at Christmas. Many also elaborately decorate their homes with lights. Some of the displays are even synchronized to Christmas songs called carols. Originally these songs were religious, but now they are about the spirit of the season.",B2

Subject: Request for time off
Dear Ms Jensen,
I'm writing to request some time off between Monday 18 February and Friday 8 March in order to work on my MBA dissertation, which is due for submission on 30 March.
I understand that the three weeks I am requesting exceeds my remaining annual leave by four days. I would like to ask if those four days may be taken in lieu of the extra working hours I put in during the two weekends of the Chicago International Management Conference last November.
I have spoken to Kristian Sander and Jasmine Riber, who have both agreed to cover for me during my absence. I would also distribute a playbook for my team members so that everyone is clear on the tasks they are in charge of and the deadlines they have to meet. During my leave, I would be fully reachable by phone and email to answer any questions or provide any assistance needed. I would also be happy to discuss any further plans to ensure my workload is covered.
I believe that the research I am doing and the resulting MBA will contribute greatly to my professional development, and my improved expertise and qualifications will in turn benefit the company.
Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you for your consideration of my request.
Best regards,

"A judge in New Haven sentenced a 31-year-old man to death Friday for his role in a deadly home invasion that killed a woman and her two daughters in 2007.
Jurors convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in October on six capital felony charges. The 12-member jury had recommended death by lethal injection on each of the counts.
 The task of sentencing another human being to death is the most sober and somber experience a judge can have, said Superior Court Judge Jon Blue.
Komisarjevsky responded Friday, saying that he came into this trial angry and defiant. 
It's a surreal experience to be condemned to die, he said. Our apathetic pursuits trampled the innocent. 
He said, I did not rape. I did not pour that gas or light that fire. 
 I will never find peace again and my soul is torn, Komisarjevsky added.
The family of his victims left the courtroom before Komisarjevsky spoke.
Richard Hawke, in a victim's statement prior to the sentencing, said the killings of his daughter and granddaughters had left him half-past dead. 
 They offered to give you everything you asked for, you did n't have to take their lives, he told Komisarjevsky. You will from now on be known as a prison number in the book of death. You are now in God's hands. 
The man convicted of being Komisarjevsky's accomplice, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in 2010. Juries convicted the pair on charges that they beat and tied up Dr. William Petit Jr., raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before trying to flee.
Petit is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters.
 I lost my family and my home, said Petit. My wife, my friend, my partner. I miss our late night chats and our partnership in raising the girls. 
Before assaulting and killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence that the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said.
The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held.
Hayes had been charged with third-degree burglary in 2003 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released three years later to a halfway house, where he met Komisarjevsky.
Komisarjevsky's attorneys had asked for leniency, arguing that he had no prior history of violence, was abused as a child and had been committed to a mental hospital for depression.

"There was a time on this land when the United States of America did not exist. Prior to the 1770s, the region was largely Indian country with the exception of 13 British colonies in the northeast part of the country. These colonies were known as the American Colonies, and were under British rule. The 13 colonies were a loosely connected group of individual states that were governed by the Continental Congress. The congress had been at odds against the British for several years, primarily because of the taxes that were being levied by their Parliament.
 
In 1775, after a year of war between the American colonies and England, the colonists decided it was time to become independent. The English Parliament had issued two unpopular taxes, which were imposed to help support the British after the end of the Seven Years War. The colonists asked Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence arguing that since the colonies had no voice in Parliament's matters, they should not be taxed.
The declaration was drafted by Jefferson on July 2, 1776, and was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th. Today, July 4th is celebrated in the United States as the day of independence from British rule. The declaration features what has been called the most famous sentence in the English language. It reads: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" These words were written to represent the moral and ethical standards the new country was meant to follow. It is a beautifully written document, and it stands for all that this country tries to be.",B2
"Some of the biggest and most expensive transportation projects in the world have involved building bridges. Bridges are crucial links that carry cars, trucks and trains across bodies of water, mountain gorges or other roads. As a result, they are one of the most important aspects of civil engineering and are subject to intense scrutiny, especially when they collapse.
Bridge collapses can be tragic events, leading to loss of life and serious property damage. That's why bridge engineers, designers and builders must always take their jobs very seriously. The best way for them to prevent these accidents is to understand why bridges collapse in the first place. Understanding bridge collapses can lead to major changes in the design, construction and safety of future building projects. The following are main reasons why bridges fall.
Fire
Historically, more bridges were made of wood and were much more susceptible to fire. This was particularly true of old-fashioned train bridges, where the spark created by the steel wheels and steel tracks could sometimes cause a bridge to catch fire and burn to the ground.
During construction
A large number of bridge accidents occur during the construction of the bridge itself. These accidents are often due to an error made by the engineers, such as a miscalculation. The bridge collapses under its own weight, and this can be deadly for the workers on it at the time.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes damage all structures, including bridges. Luckily, this kind of collapse is relatively infrequent, especially with modern bridges. Engineers have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement.
By defect
Some bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation. In some cases, this could happen because inferior-quality material was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight and no more.
Boat or train crash
Both of these kinds of accidents are extremely rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to collapse for different reasons. With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse, even if they are moving very slowly when it occurs.
The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents.",B2
"The Fourth of July is the United States' celebration of its independence from England. It is the day when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the new country's forefathers, and is a national holiday. It has been celebrated every year since 1776. Americans hold this day as one of the most revered holidays in the country.
 
Independence Day celebrations include firework shows that are held by various organizations throughout the country. The shows are held at stadiums, recreational parks, and private homes. Additionally, many businesses have giveaways and special discounts for all residents on this day. The firework shows are best at stadiums, where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks from vendors who sell their goods in supermarket parking lots.
The reason many cities no longer allow the sales, or use of fireworks is because of the fire hazards they pose. This is why the large, professional celebrations stadiums and parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still celebrate at home though. There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.
Another Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great meaning to most Americans.",B2
"Social media, magazines and shop windows bombard people daily with things to buy, and British consumers are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before. Online shopping means it is easy for customers to buy without thinking, while major brands offer such cheap clothes that they can be treated like disposable items - worn two or three times and then thrown away.
In Britain, the average person spends more than GBP1,000 on new clothes a year, which is around four per cent of their income. That might not sound like much, but that figure hides two far more worrying trends for society and for the environment. First, a lot of that consumer spending is via credit cards. British people currently owe approximately GBP670 per adult to credit card companies. That's 66 per cent of the average wardrobe budget. Also, not only are people spending money they don't have, they're using it to buy things they don't need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing a year, most of which goes into landfill sites.
People might not realise they are part of the disposable clothing problem because they donate their unwanted clothes to charities. But charity shops can't sell all those unwanted clothes. 'Fast fashion' goes out of fashion as quickly as it came in and is often too poor quality to recycle; people don't want to buy it second-hand. Huge quantities end up being thrown away, and a lot of clothes that charities can't sell are sent abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems.
However, a different trend is springing up in opposition to consumerism - the 'buy nothing' trend. The idea originated in Canada in the early 1990s and then moved to the US, where it became a rejection of the overspending and overconsumption of Black Friday and Cyber Monday during Thanksgiving weekend. On Buy Nothing Day people organise various types of protests and cut up their credit cards. Throughout the year, Buy Nothing groups organise the exchange and repair of items they already own.
The trend has now reached influencers on social media who usually share posts of clothing and make-up that they recommend for people to buy. Some YouTube stars now encourage their viewers not to buy anything at all for periods as long as a year. Two friends in Canada spent a year working towards buying only food. For the first three months they learned how to live without buying electrical goods, clothes or things for the house. For the next stage, they gave up services, for example haircuts, eating out at restaurants or buying petrol for their cars. In one year, they'd saved $55,000.
The changes they made meant two fewer cars on the roads, a reduction in plastic and paper packaging and a positive impact on the environment from all the energy saved. If everyone followed a similar plan, the results would be impressive. But even if you can't manage a full year without going shopping, you can participate in the anti-consumerist movement by refusing to buy things you don't need. Buy Nothing groups send a clear message to companies that people are no longer willing to accept the environmental and human cost of overconsumption.",B2
"A flurry of small earthquakes rumbling near the Mammoth Mountain Volcano, have been categorized as volcanic unrest by the United States Geological Survey.
Nearly three dozen earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2.6 to 3.8 have swarmed the area, northeast of Fresno, California, over the last two days.
Earthquake swarms in this region are not uncommon. David Shelly, a seismologist with California Volcano Observatory, said this swarm is bigger than we 've seen recently, but normal in the area. He adds they are keeping a close eye on the movement, but in the larger scheme of things, it's within in the range of activity over the last several decades. 
Mammoth Mountain is in an area called the Long Valley Caldera. The center of the caldera has been uplifting slowly over the last several decades and seismologists continuously monitor it. We think there is fluid coming up from the crust triggering the earthquakes, said Shelly.
The last swarm of quakes from 1997 to 1998 produced over 2,500 earthquakes per week at its height, according to the USGS. Since then, the region has been relatively quiet.
In July, USGS scientists installed a volcanic-gas monitoring station on the mountain. It tracks gases that fluctuate with earthquake activity to better track the changes in real-time.
The awareness level on the USGS website remains at green/normal. Mammoth Mountain, standing at 11,053 feet, last erupted about 57,000 years ago, according to the USGS.

"On December 7, 1941, the United States of America was attacked by the Imperial Japanese Navy at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The surprise attack was intended to destroy the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more than 350 Japanese airplane fighters, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched from six aircraft carriers.
 
The early-morning attack sank four U.S. battleships, and four more were heavily damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the Japanese also destroyed, or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, a minelayer, and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, with many of them on the ground. The attack was devastating. It took the U.S. years to recover from all the damage caused on that fateful morning. However, the Japanese were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy's aircraft carriers. By what some call a stroke of luck, the U.S. carrier fleet was out to sea at the time of the attack.
The country was in shock at the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called the attack cowardly, and declared December 7th as ""A day that will live in infamy."" On December 8, the United States formally declared war on Japan. This plummeted the country into World War II, which Roosevelt had long hoped to avoid. Soon after the United States' declaration of war against Japan, Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was now fully involved in the greatest war in the history of the world.",B2
"Nowadays all the information we could ever need is available online and some people say that means the end of having to learn anything.
It is true that these days everything you want to know is a few clicks away as long as you have internet access. However, not everyone has working internet all the time, for example in certain buildings or remote locations, so we do need to be able to remember information. Moreover, it takes time to look up everything you need to know online, whereas remembering something is immediate. The human memory is a much more efficient system.
Another problem is the quality of the information online. How do we know if it is accurate or reliable? We need to think about other facts we know and remember how to compare information from different websites. Knowing (and remembering) how to find certain information will be more important than knowing the information itself.
Finally, the internet is a good tool but it is not a useful replacement for our brains. If we did not remember anything, we would all spend even more time on our phones and computers than we already do, which is not good for society.
In conclusion, the internet offers us many things but it is still important to use our knowledge and memories. We need our memories to function without the internet and we also need to know how to use the internet properly.",B2
"The airline operating an Airbus A310-300 jet that crashed in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday with 153 people aboard was being monitored by EU authorities, according to France's transport minister.
An Airbus 310 like the one pictured crashed while on the way to the capital of Comoros.
Dominique Bussereau told French television that inspectors in his country had also noted several faults on the doomed Yemenia Airways plane, Agence France-Presse reported.
 The company was not on the blacklist -LRB- of airlines banned from European airspace -RRB- but was being subjected to closer inspection by us and was due to soon be heard by the security committee of the European Union, Bussereau said.
The Airbus A310 was inspected in France in 2007 by the French civil aviation authority and a certain number of faults had been noted. 
 The plane had not since then reappeared in our country, he added.
However, Chris Yates, an aviation analyst for Jane's Information Group, said he suspected weather and/or airport failings were a greater factor in the crash than a technical fault. Recent plane crashes 
 It's more than likely to be a weather-related incident. Having said that, you can not rule out a maintenance issue, Yates told CNN.
Yemenia Air had used the jet since 1999, on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would assist in investigating the crash.
 We are extremely saddened and our thoughts are with the families, friends and loved ones affected by this accident, Airbus spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma told CNN.
 We are giving our maximum support and assistance to the authorities and the airline. 
 This includes a team of Airbus experts that will go on site and our crisis center has been open since early this morning, where our specialists work in direct contact with the airline and the authorities, Bergsma added.
 The task now is to gather as much information as possible, including retrieval of the black boxes, to help us understand what happened. This will need time and patience. 
It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.
In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.
One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

"Syria's embattled government will get at least 10 fighter jets from Russia -- and they want more, Russian state media reports -- moves that come amid rocky diplomatic efforts to peacefully end the Middle East nation's bloody civil war.
A source involved in Russia's defense complex told the official Itar-Tass news agency Friday that Russia will sell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government MiG-29 fighter jets to fulfill a contract... concluded long ago. 
A Syrian delegation in Moscow is pressing for even more jets, with MiG executive Sergei Korotkov telling Russia's state-run RIA Novosti's news that his company and these Syrian authorities are talking about the details and time frame of a possible contact. 
Such discussions come on the heels of the European Union's decision to end its Syrian arms embargo. That move was seen as opening the door for European nations to help rebel fighters militarily, though it may give Russia more wiggle room to back its longtime ally, Assad.
It's not clear how weapons, fighter jets and ammunition flowing into Syria will affect the fighting there, much less the heretofore unsuccessful attempts to forge a negotiated settlement.
About 80,000 people have been killed since the start of hostilities more than two years ago, U.N. General Assembly President Vuk Jeremic said earlier this month. Another 1.5 million or more people have fled the country.
In addition to the fighter jets, Russia reportedly sold six S-300 air defense systems to Syria under a 2010 contract.
Asked Thursday about these and other arms sales, al-Assad said it is not our policy to talk publicly about military issues in terms of what we possess or what we receive. 
Blast in Damascus neighborhood kills 8
 As far as Russia is concerned, the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis, he told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV, according to a transcript from Syria's official SANA news service. We have negotiated with them on different kinds of weapons for years, and Russia is committed to honoring these contracts. 
Moscow, however, has said such deliveries would conform with international law and has denied supplying Syria with weapons that can be used against civilians.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described any transfer of S-300s to the region as not helpful. 
 Whether it's an old contract or not, it has a profoundly negative impact on the balance of interests and the stability of the region, and it does put Israel at risk, he said.
Kerry added that halting the bloodshed peacefully should be everyone's first priority.
 The best chance to save Syria -LRB- and -RRB- for a future Syria that represents all Syrian people and moves beyond this massacre, devastation, killing, sectarian violence... is through a peaceful resolution that comes about in an organized way, he said Friday at a joint news conference in Washington with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.
 In Geneva, we will test who is serious. Are the Russians serious pushing to that ? I believe they are. -LRB- But -RRB- it is not helpful to have a lot of other ammunition, other supplies overtly going in. 
Syrian arms embargo: Why more weapons to Syria is a mistake
Conference on crisis planned for Switzerland
He was referring to an international conference on the crisis slated for Switzerland. The plans are being worked out, but al-Assad predicted it will take place in June.
 We have announced a couple of days ago that we agree in principle to attend, he said.
But the Syrian leader made clear that his position may change, and Damascusdelegation may withdraw, if certain conditions are imposed.
 So the idea of the conference, of a meeting, in principle is a good one, he told Al-Manar TV. We will have to wait and see. 
The National Coalition, the main rebel umbrella group, has demanded al-Assad step aside in order for it to take part in the talks, which were originally scheduled for this month.
 It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly being hammered by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces, George Sabra, acting chairman of the National Coalition, said in a statement.
He cited the siege of Qusayr and attacks on Eastern Gouta, a suburb of Damascus, as well as what he said was an invasion by Iranian militia members in support of al-Assad.
Al-Assad said it's too early to discuss whether or not he 'll run again for president in the 2014 election. He 'd do so if there is a need and public desire for him to stay on, but wo n't if I feel that the Syrian people do not want me to lead them. 
The Syrian president his only condition is that anything agreed to address the crisis should not be binding until Syrians approve it through a popular referendum.
 Either side can propose anything, but nothing can be implemented without the approval of the Syrian people. And as long as we are the legitimate representatives of the people, we have nothing to fear, the Syrian leader said.

Opposition group: 50 prisoners executed
All the deals and the talk have done little to change the situation on the ground in Syria.
The killing continued Friday, with the opposition Local Coordination Committees reporting 189 deaths, including six women, five children and 19 who died after being tortured.
There were 74 people killed in Aleppo province, including 50 prisoners who the group said were executed by government forces in Aleppo's Central Prison, the group said.
In addition, Syrian state-run television have reported that forces loyal to al-Assad killed three Westerners -- an American woman, a Briton and a person whose nationality was not revealed.
The news outlet said Thursday the three had been fighting alongside the rebels and were found with weapons. The report said they were ambushed in their car in the flashpoint province of Idlib in northwestern Syria, where government forces have been battling rebels for control.
TV video showed a bullet-riddled car and three bodies laid out on the ground. It also showed weapons, a computer, a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front.
The United States is aware of the report of the reported killing of the American and is working through the Czech Republic mission in Syria to obtain more information, a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN.
Citing privacy concerns, the official said, We are unable to comment further. 
Pictures circulating on the Internet show the body of Nicole Lynn Mansfield, 33, of Flint, Michigan, her father and daughter told CNN on Friday.
The UK Foreign Office confirmed that a British national was among the dead. Their family has been informed and we are providing consular assistance, it said.
Kerry, the top U.S. diplomat, said that some 1,500 to 2,000 American fighters may be in Syria.
 It's hard to get a peg on the exact number, he said.

"Tennis ace Serena Williams clarified Wednesday the controversial comments she made in a magazine article about the victim's role in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case that garnered national headlines earlier this year.
In March, two high school football players were convicted of raping a drunk teen at a party and posting pictures of the incident online.
In an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Williams talks about the convicted rapists after a news report about the case appeared on a nearby TV screen during the interview. Do you think it was fair, what they got ? They did something stupid, but I do n't know. I 'm not blaming the girl, but if you 're a 16-year-old and you 're drunk like that, your parents should teach you: Do n't take drinks from other people, she told Rolling Stone.
Of the victim, Williams also says in the interview: She's 16, why was she that drunk where she does n't remember ? It could have been much worse. She's lucky. Obviously, I do n't know, maybe she was n't a virgin, but she should n't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different. 
The comments, posted on Rolling Stone's website Tuesday, immediately caused a firestorm on social media, particularly on Twitter where users castigated the tennis star.
On Wednesday, Williams released a statement on her website clarifying her remarks.
 What happened in Steubenville was a real shock for me. I was deeply saddened. For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy ! For both families involved -- that of the rape victim and of the accused, she wrote.
 I am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article. What was written -- what I supposedly said -- is insensitive and hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to blame, Williams added.
Stephen Rodrick, who wrote the Rolling Stone article, stands by his reporting, telling the Poynter Institute: The interview is on tape. Other than that, I 'll let the story speak for itself.

"BP said Sunday that it is pleased with how the operation to place a new cap on its ruptured undersea well is proceeding.
Officials hope the containment cap will stop oil from gushing into the Gulf. But while robots replace the old cap, crude is flowing freely.
The procedure -- expected to take four to seven days -- continued to progress Sunday as crews worked to position a transition spool over the gushing well to prepare for the new connection, according to BP's Senior Vice President Kent Wells.
 We 're pleased with how it's going, Wells said, but cautioned that the operation, which began Saturday with the removal of the old cap, is only in its second day.
Robots removed six giant bolts from the apparatus early Sunday so that the new cap could be positioned.
If successful, the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started April 20 after a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico.
But officials have said the new containment cap would be a temporary fix, and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well. There are two relief wells under construction.
Wells said Sunday that one of the relief wells could intercept the ruptured well as early as the end of July.
 We 're feeling very good about how we 've positioned that well, he said.
The other relief well is expected to be completed in August.
The old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day -LRB- 630,000 gallons -RRB- to a ship. BP still is recovering an additional 8,000 to 9,000 barrels a day -LRB- 336,000 to 378,000 gallons -RRB- through a line connected to another vessel, the Q4000.
 As we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity, we should see less and less flow, Wells said.
The Helix Producer recovery vessel is expected to begin collecting oil Sunday evening, Wells said, and officials hope to reach its full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 to 1.5 million gallons -RRB- per day within three days.
Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels -LRB- 2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons -RRB- a day should be collected as part of the containment process, Wells said. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from BP's breached well.
BP says there will be a period of decreased oil and gas capture from the wellhead during the cap replacement. It said another recovery vessel, the Q4000, should continue to capture and flare oil and gas. There will be other recovery vessels and skimmers deployed.
Two more oil skimmers were added to the Gulf Sunday bringing the total to 48 collecting an oil and water mix from the surface, BP officials said. And another 15 burns were conducted in calm seas.
 It was a good day in trying to contain the oil that made it out to the surface, Wells said.
Wells also said there will be significant measurement capability added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate.
BP said in a statement that the new cap should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times. 
Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday that the new cap would allow responders to collect more accurate oil flow data and that, once the switch is complete, the resulting capacity to contain oil will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems.

"Veterans Day is an official United States holiday observed on November 11th every year. While Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a U.S. federal holiday, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have the day off from work. Banks are also closed. If November 11th falls on a Sunday, then the holiday is observed on the following Monday.
 
The holiday was first observed after World War I, which ended On November 11 1918. It was called Armistice Day then and was more about celebrating the absence of war and honoring those that served in that one war. It didn't become known as Veterans Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were many more members of the armed forces.
Many restaurants offer free meals to veterans on the date. There is always a special ceremony at Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington D.C. This ceremony involves a wreath being placed over the grave of The Unknown Soldier. Many major cities also hold parades on this date. The U.S. flag is usually flown at half-mast as a remembrance to those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the holiday is called Remembrance Day. One symbol of the day is the poppy flower. The red poppy flower is said to represent or be a symbol of the blood of soldiers. Many people wear or give out poppy flowers on the day.",B2
"Back in 2005, when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. While the iPhone was still a gleam in Steve Jobs's eye, BlackBerry's innovations ensured its smartphone was one of Canada's biggest exports. 
Six years later, in the summer of 2011, as violence engulfed London and spread to Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester, so effective was BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) at mobilizing the rioters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down. But two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug. As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades, the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook's and Apple's own-brand instant messaging applications to independent start-ups such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). Free to download and use, they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips,'stickers', and even videos in WhatsApp's case, between most types of phones. 
In an attempt to retain its following, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition, the response has been overwhelming, with an announcement that there have been more than 20 million downloads. But, despite the initial interest, many believe BBM's wider release will do little to save the service. 
""The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,"" says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. ""WhatsApp has removed the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry."" BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services expose BBM's limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids the world over, are also unforgivably absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions. 
Messaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat's pictures, which self-delete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. Yet as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen. 
""We could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,"" said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting. ""The social networking wasn't the reason,"" he says. ""I know a lot of people who were out rioting. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words 'stop and search' around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men."" 
Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day but 46% use alternatives. ""It's a much more complex, multifaceted environment,"" says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders. ""The smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others disappear into thin air."" 
Thirteen-year-old Bennett has three devices, all hand-me-downs from family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone. His friends are still on BBM - the four phone thefts at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner's entire contacts book - several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. ""Instagram is Facebook without parents,"" he says. ""Facebook has been taken over by the older generation. Once I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account."" 
For families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter, the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a second-hand device and a GBP7-a-month deal from T-Mobile. But trust in the privacy of BBM's system has been eroded. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company's secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief. 
Across town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in well-heeled South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their handsets. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. ""I still have a Blackberry, but I'm the only one,"" says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make him feel? ""Isolated,"" he replies.

"Smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high. They should break 39 billion tons this year.
But there's also some good news, a new study published Tuesday said. The rate at which people are polluting the air may be leveling off.
In the West, emissions contributing to global warming even dropped last year.
The United States pumped 3.7 % less carbon dioxide into the air in 2012 than in the previous year; Europe 1.8 % less.
Globally, greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year, and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole, said researchers at Britain's East Anglia University.
Justices to review greenhouse gas regulation
Drop in the bucket
It's an improvement -- but a drop in the bucket by global emission standards.
Greenhouse gases are blowing into the atmosphere at rates 61 % higher than they were in 1990, the baseline year for the Kyoto Protocol.
The international agreement is designed to decrease emissions contributing to global warming by holding its signees to reduction goals. The vast majority of the world's nations have signed on to it.
The United States is not one of them.
China is.
But the world's largest carbon emitter, which wrested the dubious title from the United States in recent years, pumped 5.9 % more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year.
India contributed 7.7 % more emissions in 2012.
Path to catastrophe
Not only must the increase stop, the researchers said, but industrialized nations must achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Time is running out to stop the world from reaching a dreading global warming threshold.
The world is on a course with current emission levels to reach a rise in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or more and end up in the worst climate change scenario issued by the U.N. panel on climate change.
The study includes a carbon atlas, which shows levels of pollution emitted by each nation and their development over the last 50 years.
In 2012, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases were China with 27 %, the United States with 14 % and the European Union with 10 %.
On an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year.
Americans still polluted the most by far, with more than 17 tons of carbon gas emitted per person in 2012.

"More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible wilderness, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest.
But Australia is grappling with a dilemma: how to balance conservation with the need for tourist spending.
 Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure -- there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park, said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society.
 It's not a completely resilient piece of nature we can do anything with. 
Maintaining wilderness is an expensive business, and visitor numbers have fallen in recent years.
The number of trips including an overnight stay has almost halved in the last decade, from 1.045 million in 1999, according to Tourism Research Australia figures quoted in the Sydney Daily Telegraph.
They show an 18 percent drop in one year, from 687,000 in 2008 to 563,000 last year.
The New South Wales government now wants to increase both tourist numbers and spending by attracting visitors interested in a more comfortable, less rugged experience.
Its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park.
Mark Jarvis, who runs a hotel in Katoomba, the main tourist town in the Blue Mountains, just an hour and a half from Sydney, said: We 're very concerned because the uniqueness of area revolves around the fact that we sit in between World Heritage parks.
 So the fact that they are looking at developing, the fact that if there is a potential to do it, it's not right for this area.
 It's not in Sydney's interests to see this area develop -- the attraction for Sydney people to come here is our lack of development. 
Cameron agreed: What I see happening in New South Wales is a distraction and diversion away from nature conservation as the primary purpose of parks -- and if we do n't focus on that the standards and the state of our parks will slowly decline. 
However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see.
 If there was increased interest in development, I think those investors would only do it in terms of: is it sustainable ? said Walker. Is there going to be a return on investment ? And it's going to be in built-up areas where zoning allows it. I do n't think there would be any development that would be a negative impact on the environment. 
 We have to have a sustainable impact on the natural asset, which all tourism operators value and treasure and want to preserve. 
Penelope Figgis, a government advisor on conservation and tourism, also believes the park has to develop.
She said: Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future. We have very urbanized population who are not as connected with nature.
 The New South Wales government wanted to see how we could connect with nature but also at the same time stimulate regional economies through tourism activities related to nature conservation.
 I ca n't think of a better way to persuade somebody to be an advocate for a beautiful and wild area than going there and immersing themselves in that experience, she added.
The danger in this quest for something new, is turning nature into a commodity, argued Cameron.
 I think national parks and nature is worth more than just being the new thing, the sort of new product, she said.
 We have 92 percent of the state of New South Wales that is taken up by people.
 Only eight percent is national park. They 're the bits that we 've put aside for nature -- do we really need to encroach on those as well.
 The coffee shop is not an endangered species. Humans are doing very well -- we are looking after ourselves very well. At some point we need to say: When is it nature's turn ?

"-LRB- CNN -RRB- Syria is a Hell on Earth that is expanding in plain sight.
The death toll there has doubled in a year's time, if an opposition group is right.
Since civil war broke out there, 310,000 people have been killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday. A year earlier, SOHR's tally stood at 162,402. And the year before, the United Nations put the death toll at 70,000.
Violence has plunged well over half of all Syrians into such destitution that they are in dire need of survival aid, the United Nations says, as food rations are being cut for lack of donations.
Numbers alone ca n't convey the immeasurable anguish of millions, but maybe it can remind the rest of us of the magnitude of the world's currently greatest tragedy.
The number of years since perpetual bloodshed began, since dictator Bashar al-Assad's security forces fired on crowds of demonstrators and armed militant groups rose up against him in March 2011.
Percentage of the Syrian population killed. It would be like killing 3 to 4 million Americans. The range comes from the SOHR's death toll of 310,000 and a recent lower estimate by the U.N. of at least 220,000 dead.
The number of Syrians in need of immediate life-saving aid, according to the U.N. That's the population of Moscow.
Syrians driven from their homes, the U.N. says. Imagine the entire Boston metropolitan area emptied out.
Syrians who have fled as refugees to neighboring countries, creating humanitarian and economic hardship across Syria's borders. Turkey has taken in 1.7 million, Lebanon 1.2 million, Jordan 625,000, and Iraq 245,000.
The reduction in the size of food rations the World Food Programme says it has been forced to make due to a lack of donations. That means people receiving aid will get only 60 % of the daily nutrition they need.

"Getting out of her car, the wife of a furloughed government worker walked toward a small building full of free food.
She approached the door with her head down. An attendant asked for her name, she looked up and began to sob.
 It's ok, it's not your fault, the volunteer said as she wrapped her arms around the crying woman.
Chesapeake Cares Food Pantry, located 30 miles from the political impasse in Washington that resulted in the shutdown, put together a food giveaway tailored to affected workers not at their jobs and not being paid.
Roughly 200 people received bags of frozen meat, canned vegetables and other staples on Monday morning.
 These folks -LRB- furloughed government employees -RRB- do n't know how to be poor, said Rev. Robert Hahn, the head End Hunger in Calvert County, a consortium of food pantries in the area. These folks are fish out of water and they feel humiliated, like they have lost their dignity. 
This is the second offering Hahn's group has made to federal employees. Last week, the group passed out 2,700 pounds of food to 71 different families. And if the government shutdown continues, Hahn said he anticipates his group will continue this sort of offering.
The shutdown that began on October 1 has impacted hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors in the Washington region, including people at the epicenter of the partisan shutdown showdown in Congress.
Washington-area food banks have responded to an unexpected need this fall created by the shutdown, their efforts already tested by a continued, uneven economic recovery and tough job market.
Men and women were on both sides of the help on Monday in Calvert County -- those receiving and those distributing food.
Those helping out included one person who works for the Department of Justice and another employed by the Navy.
CNN agreed not to identify furloughed workers receiving food due to a combination of their embarrassment and not wanting to hurt their employer.
 Getting paid helps, but it does n't help right now, said one, who acknowledged she 'll probably get paid once the shutdown ends.
Still, the woman said she is struggling to put food on the table.
Some told CNN they were living paycheck to paycheck.
 The biggest thing -LRB- people are feeling -RRB- is fear, said Hahn. Even a lot of federal employees who know that they 're going to get their checks made up, they 're still going to be shy if they miss a couple of pay periods.
President Barack Obama visited a food pantry in downtown Washington on Monday where he helped make peanut butter sandwiches.
He told reporters that he stopped by Martha's Table because many of volunteers there had been furloughed.
 They 're here contributing and giving back to the community and I think that shows the kind of spirit that we have among all kinds of federal workers all across the country, people who dedicate their lives to public service, Obama said.
Hahn, who has worked for Chesapeake Church for 20 years, said many of the men and women he saw collect food on Monday were new faces who had never sought their help in the past.
While a study by Main Street showed that Calvert County was the 13th wealthiest county in the United States in 2012, Hahn said that ranking does n't show how many working poor live in the area.
 It's a damn shame, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told CNN. It's no fault of their own, but they find themselves now in a position of, of having to come here for help. 
O'Malley, who attended the event, said he would recommend that those who for ideological reasons feel shutting down our government is a good idea should come here and see the families that are showing up for help to feed their families for the first time in their lives. 
As volunteers passed out food, there was obvious frustration with political leaders in Washington.
Those in line lamented the fact they were expected to just go without pay.
Hahn said he had more important things to do than worry about how things will shake out on Capitol Hill.
 I would say this to the president and Congress, your job is to solve problems, not to create problems, Hahn said. We are here solving problems.

"Back in 2010, the old city in Srinagar was the sort of place police would only venture into wearing body armour. A stronghold for violent separatists agitating for an independent Kashmir, it was at the centre of uprisings that left more than 100 people dead, buried along with dreams of peace in the mountainous north-Indian region. 
How quickly things change. Now carefree tourists line up in the same streets for barbecued mutton tikka and steaming plates of rogan josh. The Nowhatta mosque, where in the summer of 2010 youths would gather after Friday prayers to throw stones at the security forces, is to become part of an official walking tour focused on heritage, crafts and markets. Down by Dal Lake, houseboats have been booked out months in advance. In the stunning gardens lining the lake's green slopes, visitors can have their picture taken against one of Asia's prettiest backdrops. Until the snow melted, the nearby ski resorts were packed with rich Russians, too. 
In 2002, only just over 27,000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley, frightened off by the anti-Indian insurgency, which has claimed up to 70,000 lives. So far in 2012, the area has received almost one million holidaymakers - more than 23,000 of them from outside India. But fewer than 150 Britons were among them - largely because the UK's Foreign Office refuses to amend its somewhat hair-raising advice, which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region. 
Omar Abdullah, the UK-born Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, has lobbied the British High Commission in Delhi to relax the guidelines, but to no avail. ""It's a source of frustration,"" admitted Abdullah, who has been in charge of India's most sensitive state since the start of 2009. ""Today, unfortunately, as a result of that travel advisory, people's insurance is null and void when they visit here."" The last publicized case of foreign tourists being murdered in J&K was in 1995, when six westerners including two Britons were kidnapped by Al-Faran, a Kashmiri militant Islamist group. Only one escaped with his life. 
""You've had British citizens killed more recently in countries that you still haven't stopped people from visiting. I mean, how many British citizens did you lose in 9/11? Did you stop people from visiting New York? You've lost them in Spain, in Bali; tell me where you haven't lost them,"" said Abdullah. ""We've lost Indians in London. There is still a possibility that al-Qaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past, but we haven't stopped Indians from travelling to London. There is no reason to single out Jammu and Kashmir, or even Srinagar, as an unsafe destination."" 
Germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region in 2011. ""Foreigners are generally not direct targets of clashes,"" counselled Germany's amended advice. At the time, it was viewed by many outsiders as a bold move, coming less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally died down. A nationwide holiday on 15 August marked 65 years of Indian independence - in the past, a day fraught with peril in a state where many do not feel part of the world's biggest democracy. But this time at the independence celebrations there was no trouble. 
Abdullah insists tourists are safe in the state, ""as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would "". In other words, do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of J&K. Syed Ali Shah Geelani, leader of the pro-Kashmiri independence party, disagrees bitterly with much of Abdullah's politics. But on the issue of tourism, the two are united. At the start of the summer season, Geelani wrote an open letter to tourists and pilgrims that said: ""Whatever your faith, whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong, we are bound by a common bond, the bond of humanity. You are our honoured guest - respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith."" 
Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems. But all the locals we spoke to in Srinagar were wholeheartedly in favour of tourism. Amjid Gulzar, 26, said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors. ""He must do both; but without tourism, our economy will be in chaos,"" he said, adding that while he welcomed the million tourists who visited this year, Kashmir had to do more to attract big-spending visitors, especially foreigners. 
""We need better infrastructure, better roads, reliable electricity. We need more for tourists to do in the evening - we don't even have one cinema in this city and there isn't enough for tourists to do after dark,"" he said. But will tourists feel welcome? In June, a local Islamic group issued a ""dress code"" for foreign tourists. Abdullah sighs at the mention of that furore. ""Nobody expects tourists to come here and cover their faces. I think what they were talking about was short shorts and sleeveless vests, which even then would not be something that would attract too much attention ... I think the basic point they were making was: be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately. I think that's common sense."" 
Abdullah said he was on a tourism drive ""for no other reason than the fact that I need to stimulate the econom "". J&K's finances are in a dire state after more than two decades of turmoil. The state receives just GBP72m each year in taxes, and yet the salary bill for the 500,000 public employees is GBP155m, he said. It is clear why he needs to find more funds, fast. For now, though, he is just cautiously pleased to see tourists back. ""I'm not suggesting that because we've had one million tourists here that it's a sign of normality,"" he said. ""But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come, have a nice time, and go back.""

"Not every parent looks forward to the day when their child goes off to school. In fact some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead they are choosing to teach their children at home. This is called homeschooling. Parents, caregivers, or private tutors educate children individually at home instead of sending them off to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. only about three percent of children are homeschooled.
 
There are many reasons why some parents choose to homeschool. One reason is that some parents do not feel their children are safe in school because of bullying and a growing trend of police in school. Other parents want their child's education to be based on their religion or moral beliefs. Yet other parents feel like the education in school is not good enough. Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.
There are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents to customize lessons based on their children's needs. Families can purchase textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that homeschooling means students won't have opportunities to socialize. To answer this concern, some families have created cooperatives, where a group of homeschooled students will learn and play together and participate in activities that would normally happen in school like field trips and prom.
Being homeschooled doesn't mean a student cannot go to college. Most colleges accept homeschooled students. It is important, however, for parents and students to create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned.",B2
"As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emiratesmost influential women.
But her latest project is possibly her most ambitious yet: creating the Middle East's first museum dedicated to the achievements of women.
The museum, Bait al Banaat, or House of Women, in Dubai was officially opened at the end of 2012 by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showcasing the contribution of women to the country's history.
 Women here were empowered a long time ago, but have n't had a chance to tell our story, said Ghubash. Do n't think because we are covered we are not empowered.
 Women here were not in the media, but they were economically engaged and running businesses. 
The museum is the culmination of five yearswork for Ghubash, who financed the museum with $3 million of her own money.
 For me it was a full-time job but I had 20 volunteers of all nationalities working with me in their free time. It was nice to have people with different backgrounds involved, she said.
In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in.
 I was looking for a place to build and I came across a very old house that I remember from childhood, she said. It used to be called Bait al Banaat because three unmarried women lived there. Something about the name came to life for me. 
Ghubash said her grandmothersgeneration contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized.
Arianna Huffington tells women: Less stress, more living '
The museum contains a room dedicated to the Emirati woman poet Ousha Bint Khalifa -- known as the Girl of Arabia, a gallery devoted to temporary art exhibitions, a collection of Arabian fragrances and oils, traditional jewelery and a women's study center.
 It was very important for me to present the museum in the best way possible to attract a younger generation. I want them to enjoy their culture and heritage, said Ghubash.
Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical from a career that led to her being listed 36th on Arabian Business magazine's 100 Most Powerful Arab Women in 2011.
She grew up in Dubai in a family where she was encouraged to study.
 I came from a family where both parents made sure there were books available in the house, she said. I had freedom to read and to think for myself. 
Ghubash trained as a doctor at the University of Cairo and for a PhD in London, before returning to the United Arab Emirates as an assistant professor of psychiatry.
In 2001, she became president of the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain, a post she retained until 2009.
She also founded the Arab Network of Women in Science and Technology, and served as its president for four years.
 My journey in life is very interesting, she said. I was focusing on becoming a doctor and practicing as a psychiatrist.
 Recently, I found myself attracted to something different: history and culture. 
Having achieved her goal in opening the museum, Ghubash is not content to rest and revel in the glory. She is already working on her next project to compile an encyclopaedia of women of the United Arab Emirates.

"An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea. 
In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky - a common New Zealand octopus - made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar. Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium. 
Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: ""Octopuses are famous escape artists. I don't think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what's happening on the outside. That's just his personality."" 
One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor - a journey of three or four metres - and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawke's Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. 
Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. ""When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,"" said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. ""The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and he's always been a bit of a surprise octopus."" 
Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. ""I understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well,"" he said. ""I have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?"" 
Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs, then returning to its own. Another at the centre, Ozymandias, was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean. 
Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot. He was scarred and ""rough looking"", with shortened limbs, said Yarrell. ""He had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn't in the best shape."" According to Yarrell, Inky - who is about the size of a rugby ball - was an ""unusually intelligent"" octopus. ""He was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality."" 
The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a ""one- off"" but the staff are ""increasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do"". Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on. ""You never know,"" said Yarrell. ""There's always a chance Inky could come home to us.""

"A cardinal from the Philippines, another from Austria and an archbishop from Ireland would be the least worst choices to be the next pope, according to a group representing the victims of abuse by priests.
The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, released its list Thursday as cardinals held meetings at the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff.
The three are Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines; Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria; and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, Ireland.
Martin is not a cardinal, but SNAP noted that a man need not be a cardinal to be elected pope. Historically, the role has gone to cardinals, however.
CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, also a correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, wrote last month that Schoenborn certainly has the right pedigree for the job. 
And Tagle has been a leader in pushing the church in Asia to take an aggressive stance on clerical abuse, Allen said in a series he wrote on the papal contenders.
Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said.
Wednesday, SNAP named its Dirty Dozen list of men it judged would be the worst candidates for pope because of their handling of, or comments on, past allegations of child sex abuse against clergy.
The scandal has shaken global confidence in the church in recent years.
A Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday indicates that U.S. Catholics see it as the biggest issue the Vatican faces.
Asked what they think is the most important problem, 34 % of the U.S. Catholics questioned mention sex abuse, pedophilia or some other reference to the scandal. No other problem garnered more than 10 % of the responses.
A report for Italian news magazine Panorama on Thursday claims that the church hierarchy was alerted to the problem decades ago, in 1965 but buried the warnings.
` Absolutely key '
Since Monday, the gathered cardinals have been holding meetings, known as general congregations, to discuss the most serious questions facing the church.
The last of the cardinals summoned to choose the next pope, Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man of Vietnam, arrived at the Vatican on Thursday.
No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman.
But Cardinal Roger Mahony, the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, suggested that the announcement might not be far away in a tweet posted Thursday.
 Days of General Congregations reaching a conclusion. Setting of date for Conclave nearing. Mood of excitement prevails among Cardinals, he said.
The 115 cardinal-electors -- those under the age of 80 who are eligible to vote for the new pontiff -- are taking time to prepare for what many see as their greatest responsibility.
Although some may be wondering why it's taking so long to set the date for the conclave, Lombardi pushed back against the idea that the cardinals were dragging their feet.
The discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process, he said, since once the conclave starts there wo n't be much time between votes for reflection or the exchange of ideas.
The cardinals have to have all the information they need in order to make a mature, responsible judgment in the election, especially at a time when the church faces complex issues, he said. The preparation is absolutely key, Lombardi said.
Celibacy for priests a hot issue, not just for church leaders
U.S. cardinals muzzled ?
Italian media reports Thursday focused on the Vatican's move to end the news briefings held this week by American cardinals, amid concerns over leaks of confidential discussions among the cardinals.
Sister Mary Ann Walsh, director of media relations for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote in a blog post that the decision Wednesday came after a media report in Italian daily La Stampa, which gave details of who had said what.
 I compared the shutdown to the old Catholic school style of one kid talks and everyone stays after school, she wrote, saying a similar thing happened before the last conclave in 2005.
 We 'll continue briefings, but without cardinals, to help U.S. media especially cover this exciting moment in the church, Walsh added.
It's been a week since Benedict XVI became the first pontiff in six centuries to resign from the role. Popes usually serve until their death.
With Easter around the corner, many inside the Catholic Church would like to see a new pontiff in place to lead ceremonies.
Watch for the smoke: How is a new pope elected ?
` Mix and mingle '
All the cardinals, including those older than 80, are entitled to take part in the closed-door general congregations.
Lombardi said 152 cardinals met Thursday morning. A second meeting will take place in the afternoon, as the cardinals seek to pick up the pace before agreeing on the date for the conclave.
Thursday morning's business included reports on the financial state of the Holy See, Lombardi said. He named the cardinals who delivered the reports but did not reveal their contents.
The cardinals could continue their meetings on Saturday, Lombardi added, but are unlikely to meet Sunday when Mass may be held.
Interactive: A look at possible papal contenders
Some of the discussions happen over coffee, as one Vatican spokesman revealed Monday, the first day of the general congregations.
 There's a coffee break for about 30 minutes at a special buffet area in the front part of the audience hall, said the Rev. Thomas Rosica. Cardinals have an opportunity to go down and mix and mingle. 
 They want to say what the next pope will hear, because he's probably in that room, and they also want to alert the people who have n't spent so much time in Rome just what the situation really is here as they see it, Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said.
The electors also want to go into the conclave with pretty clear ideas about whom to vote for, Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston said. They, too, have no interest in seeing it drag on, and there is no reason to believe that it will.
The past 11 conclaves have lasted no longer than four days, the diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, wrote on its website.
That was n't always the case. In the 13th century, the election of one pope took two years and nine months, the diocese said. Catholics grew so angry at the cardinalsindecision from 1268 to 1271, when Gregory X was elected, that they boarded them up in their chamber and tore off the roof to expose them to the elements.
The fiasco led to the creation of the conclave and its precise protocol -- partly to expedite the process.
What's in a name ? Clues to be found in next pope's moniker

" 
Aircraft hijacking, or skyjacking is the intentional taking of an airplane usually done for political purposes. Unlike ground vehicle hijacking, which is done for financial gain for the most part, skyjacking is a darker, more dangerous, potentially life-threatening action. During the mid-1960s to the 1970s, about 160 aircraft were skyjacked worldwide. In the United States, many had taken control of aircraft, but no one had ever escaped the reach of law enforcement with one glaring exception, D.B. Cooper.
 
D.B. Cooper's real name is Dan Cooper, but his legend began as D.B. Cooper because of a mistake by the media in 1971. On November 24, Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 jetliner after purchasing a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle, Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes to be delivered upon arrival to Seattle. Authorities complied with his ransom request, and Cooper let all 36 passengers, and most of the crew off the plane at that time.
Once back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the jet's fuel was not enough to make there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in Reno, Nevada for refueling. When the aircraft reached Reno, Cooper was not on board. It is thought that Cooper jumped out of the aircraft somewhere in the wooded forests of Oregon. He had ordered the plane to fly at the lowest possible speed, and to fly at only a 10,000 foot elevation. The legend of D.B. Cooper was born.
To this date, the Cooper skyjacking is the only case that is unresolved in the United States. Cooper was never found, nor was any evidence of the $200,000, and his parachute. Many believe Cooper could not survive a drop of such a great altitude, while others say the absence of any of the money, or any evidence of his death proves he survived. In any event, D.B. Cooper is a true American legend.",B2
"A California Republican official has apologized for sending an e-mail that depicts President Barack Obama as a young chimpanzee.
 To my fellow Americans and to everyone else who has seen the e-mail I forwarded and was offended by my action, I humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness of my unwise behavior, Marilyn Davenport said in a statement obtained by CNN.
Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the e-mail was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.
The e-mail contains a doctored photo of what appears to be a family portrait of two adult chimpanzees posing with a young chimpanzee with Obama's face pasted on it.
The caption that ran with the photo says Now you know why no birth certificate, the affiliate reported.
Davenport said she would not repeat her error in the apology that included two Bible passages.
 I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life, the statement said. I would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. So I ask for your forgiveness, for I am truly sorry. 
Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that she does not need to resign her position because of the e-mail.
Scott Baugh, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said he was surprised by the e-mail.
 There's no question the e-mail is racist. The only question is what was in Marilyn's heart, what was her intent. But I do n't think there's anybody on her committee or anybody in the world really that does n't see it as a racist, Baugh said on CNN's AC360. 
Baugh said he feels Davenport should resign.
 The bottom line is being sorry for something and having a sincere apology does n't undo the action, it does n't stop the consequences, Baugh said. There's still consequences for what she's done and what she's done will continue to bring controversy to my party so I 'm inclined to think at this time that she should still resign from the committee.

"Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to express my dismay at the service at your Eden Hill branch on Saturday 14 January.
I often collect prescriptions from the pharmacy on behalf of my grandmother, Mrs Elaine Bingham. On this occasion there were two prescriptions: one for 10 x 50 mg Kendomol and one for 50 x 100 mg Leoprone. I was served quickly even though there appeared to be only one pharmacist on duty. However, as I was leaving I saw that I had been given 500 mg tablets of Kendomol. This is ten times stronger than the prescription called for.
If I hadn't noticed the difference between the prescription and the actual tablets, my grandmother could have taken a dangerous overdose of Kendomol. I would be worried about getting any future prescriptions at Eden Hill.
The pharmacist apologised and corrected the mistake but I wanted to bring it to your attention. I think it happened because there were not enough staff on duty. I understand that mistakes happen but there needs to be a minimum of two pharmacists at all times so all prescriptions can be checked.
I hope you can take steps to make sure this mistake does not happen again.
Yours faithfully,
Roger Bingham",B2
"Critics of the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens have called the film unoriginal and predictable because the story so closely mirrors the very first Star Wars film in 1977. But, in fact, both films follow a structure that pre-dates all Hollywood films, that of the 'hero myth'. That's because director George Lucas based Star Wars on the ideas in Joseph Campbell's 1949 book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Later editions of Campbell's book even featured Star Wars' hero Luke Skywalker on the front cover.
In his book, Campbell analyses myths from all over the world to describe the 'monomyth' - a pattern that you can see in myths from every culture. In short, a hero sets off from home on a journey, where he overcomes obstacles and defeats enemies to return with a prize. It's a tale that has been told for thousands of years, from the Ancient Greeks with The Odyssey to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.
George Lucas was one of the early film directors to directly base his story on the 17 stages of the hero's journey. Typically the hero starts the story living an ordinary life, but something happens that calls them to an adventure that changes everything. At the beginning of Star Wars, Luke lives an ordinary life with his aunt and uncle, repairing robots. When he finds Princess Leia's message to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2D2, it is 'the call to adventure' that starts the hero on his journey.
According to Campbell, the hero at first refuses the call to adventure, but a mentor appears who helps them and they decide to 'cross the threshold' and travel into the 'special world' where the adventure happens. The next stage consists of passing tests, fighting enemies and meeting friends as the hero prepares to face their biggest challenge. For Luke the mentor is, of course, Obi-Wan, the friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO and the enemy is Darth Vader inside the special world of the Death Star.
Next, the hero overcomes obstacles on the way to facing their greatest challenge. There often comes a moment when they face death or loss and that experience gives them the strength to finally defeat the enemy. Luke loses his mentor when he sees Darth Vader kill Obi-Wan, which helps him find the strength he needs later on. When heroes succeed, they return from the special world, changed by their experiences forever. Luke's change comes when he remembers Obi-Wan saying, 'Use the force', and he uses it to help him aim his laser into the heart of the Death Star. Luke takes his first steps to becoming a Jedi, and the hero myth restarts in The Return of the Jedi, except this time his mentor is Yoda.",B2
"Steve Jobs was a self-made billionaire, who brought personal computers into the homes of nearly every American in the country. He is credited with developing the technology that has personalized the computers. Jobs, along with his childhood friend Steve Wozniak, co-founded Apple Computers in 1976, working out of Jobs' garage.
 
Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 to parents who gave him up for adoption shortly after birth. He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. His father was a machinist who liked to spend time with his son taking electronic components apart, and reassembling them. This is when and where Jobs developed his interest in mechanical reconstruction. Jobs was not the best student in high school. He was known as a class clown, although he was very intelligent. It was in high school that he met Wozniak.
Both Jobs and Wozniak had a great interest in electronics, and the pair was known for making computer technology smaller, cheaper, and more accessible to average persons. Jobs got his start working as a video game designer for the Atari Corporation. Once Jobs got Apple going, he sold his first computers, which were called the Apple I, for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned Jobs nearly $800,000 its first year, and that was just the beginning. The Apple II earned the fledgling company nearly $140 million, and by 1980, the company was worth $1.2 billion.
Jobs branched out his financial kingdom venturing into other businesses such as Pixar Animation Studios, which was also very successful. He briefly left Apple to found the NeXT Corporation, which produced both software and hardware, but NeXT floundered, and Jobs went back to Apple to develop iPhone and iPad. Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and eventually lost his battle with cancer in October, 2011.",B2
"In June, Diane visited her friends who live in San Francisco, California. This was Diane's first time in the city, and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk around and explore.
On the first day of her trip, Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension bridge measures 1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends did not walk across the bridge. However, they viewed it from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which offers hiking trails, picnicking areas, and presents spectacular views of the bridge and city. Diane and her friends made sure to take a group photograph here, featuring the bridge in the background.
The next day, Diane and her friends visited Alcatraz Island. This island is located 1.25 miles offshore in the San Francisco Bay. It used to serve as a lighthouse, military fort, and prison. Diane and her friends took a small tour boat across bay to reach the island. Their visit included a guided tour through the old military base and prison. They also took a walk around the island to appreciate some of the native wildlife in addition to the views of the city.
Diane and her friends spent the final day of her vist in San Francisco's downtown area. Diane's favorite part of her entire trip was taking a trolley to transport her up and down the hilly streets of San Francisco. Diane did a lot of shopping downtown on her last day. She and her friends celebrated the end of her visit by having dinner at one of San Francisco's best restaurants.",B2
"The continual relegation of women to the sidelines of football was given a good kicking when France appointed its first female professional team manager. It did not matter that it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it was, as some bad sports - male, of course - suggested, just a cynical stunt to drum up publicity for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63, currently ranking a lowly 14th out of 20 in its league. 
What mattered was that Helena Costa had been given the top job, a move that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional European league. ""As a woman, it's made me happy,"" Veronique Soulier, president of the club's supporters' association, told journalists. ""When I first heard the news, I was rather surprised, but, once that passed, we were pretty unanimous that it's good news. We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing."" 
The new manager of Clermont Foot 63, whose average home crowd at the stadium at Clermont- Ferrand in the Auvergne region of south-central France is around 3,800, is a former talent spotter for the Scottish Premiership side Celtic. Costa, 36, was born in Alhandra on the River Tagus in southeast Portugal and graduated with a master's degree in sports science. She is also a UEFA-licensed coach. She previously coached Benfica's male youth teams, the Qatar women's team, which she led to its first international victory in 2012, and, more recently, the Iranian women's national side, which she left in September 2013. 
Costa was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club. In 2013, he announced the team had signed Messi. They had. Not the Argentinian and FC Barcelona record-breaking striker Lionel Messi, but Junior Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon. 
France's women's minister, Najat Vallaud- Belkacem, tweeted: ""Bravo to Clermont Foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football."" 
Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a men's professional team, said: ""I don't know Helena, but, if she has been hired by a team, then it means that she knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day, this can become normal."" Morace was an outstanding player in the women's game. She was the top scorer for 12 seasons in Italy's Serie A and played for Italy in 153 internationals. In 1999, she was named as the coach of Viterbese in the men's Serie C1. But, after only two games, she resigned from the job following a clash with the club's mercurial proprietor, Luciano Gaucci, who at the time was also the owner of a Serie A side, Perugia. 
Morace was quoted as saying that she had refused Gaucci's demand that she fire her deputy and the side's trainer. ""He let me know that I could carry on working with whomever I wanted. But, by then, mutual trust was lacking and I didn't fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty,"" she said. Morace works today as a lawyer in Rome and as expert soccer commentator on television and in the pages of the daily Gazzetta dello Sport. 
She said: ""For the time being, I see too many men, even in the women's game, who are working, despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working."" Raymond Domenech, former manager of the French national team, said: ""Women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. Why shouldn't they manage men's teams? The opposite happens and doesn't cause any problems. It's a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. I say well done to President Michy. I told myself that, if I took charge of a club again, I'd hire a woman as my number two. He beat me to it."" 
A statement on Clermont Foot 63's website said Costa's appointment would allow the club to enter ""a new era"". On the club supporters' website, reaction to Costa's appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism. ""In my opinion, it's just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she won't last the season. I find it hard to believe she'll be able to get the players' respect, above all when she's the same age as the oldest,"" wrote one fan. ""Her CV isn't bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough?"" added another. A third wrote: ""I wish her welcome and success but I think it'll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business. Has our president pulled off a media coup?"" 
But Soulier was hopeful: ""Hopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they're lacking at the moment,"" she said. ""The boys in the team can be difficult to manage. With a woman in charge, maybe they'll be less demanding."" 
If Costa's reputation is anything to go by, she will be the one making the demands. After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jose Mourinho's first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was reportedly described as ""Mourinho in a skirt"". Costa quickly kicked the sexist remark into touch. ""Like Mourinho, I always want to win. As far as that's concerned, yes, I'm happy to be compared with him,"" she said.  ",B2
"In the United States, people love to throw parties for many reasons. Of course there are the usual birthday parties, but some people even have parties to celebrate divorces! No matter what kind of party you are going to, it's a good idea to make sure you are actually invited. It's considered rude to just show up unless the host, the person giving the party, invited you. You will either get a paper, email or verbal invitation to a party. Alternately, you can also go as a guest of someone else invited, like as his or her date. Once invited, it is very important to let the host know if you are actually going to show up. Many times hosts have a party catered, which means other people prepare the food. They need to know how much food to have. Letting them know if you are showing up or not helps the host and is considered polite.
 
It's also important to be relatively punctual for a party. Most parties in the U.S. never start exactly when they say they will. Many people like to be ""fashionably late"", that is, showing up about 30 minutes after the party is supposed to start. People like to do this to make a big entrance. Showing up more than 30 minutes before or after is considered rude though. If you show up too early, you are likely to interrupt valuable preparation time of the host. If you show up too late, you are just being rude.
Even if it is not a birthday party, it is polite to bring a gift for the host. It doesn't need to be a fancy gift. A bottle of wine, or even flowers, is polite and will be appreciated.",B2
"Sleep deprivation used to be a badge of honour: a sign you were busy and important and very much in demand. Snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps. Now, however, Arianna Huffington's The Sleep Revolution, a 'call to bed' that promises to transform your life ""one night at a time"", is a New York Times best-seller and Huffington is urging people to ""sleep their way to the top"". Meanwhile, the sleep industry has woken up big time and a whole range of start-ups are reinventing where, when and how we sleep, as well as how much we're prepared to pay for it. For the more upmarket snoozer, luxury hotels are offering ""sleep retreats""; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. And, if you're staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep ($249) to a brainwave-monitoring sleeping mask that lets you nap more efficiently ($299). 
Sleep hasn't just been corporatized - it has infiltrated corporations. A number of companies already have nap pods and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become ""as common as conference rooms"" in the next two years. So, how did this happen? How did sleep, something humans have done since long before Huffington awoke to it, suddenly become so fashionable? 
Getting enough sleep is a natural fit for the sort of lifestyle in which paying $10 for green juice and $34 for a SoulCycle class is the norm. Then, there's the rise of the quantified self through wearable technology. Our bodies have become input/output devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be tracked. What Huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that it rests you but that it restores you. Sleep, she says, is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol. 
You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight hours? Well, for one thing, she has ""nine or so"" assistants, according to a recent New York Times profile. Huffington calls them her ""A-Team""; they do everything from running her errands to planning her travel to loading The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning. According to the Times, most of the A-Team can only endure about 12 months of the work because it's so taxing. The low pay also means many of them take second jobs. Basically, they don't sleep so that Huffington can ... and can sell books about it. 
Getting enough sleep isn't just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time; it's a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. Numerous studies show that you're more likely to sleep poorly if you're poor. It's hard to sleep if you're worried about your safety or haven't had enough to eat. It's hard to sleep if you're one of the 15 million American shift workers who work irregular hours. Research has also found that there's a black/white sleep gap. One study shows that, while white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours, African Americans sleep an average of 6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality of sleep. Researchers have attributed this, in part, to the stress of discrimination. 
Want to know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America? Wealthy white women. Which, if I'd hazard a guess, is probably the same demographic Huffington is targeting her book at. Huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a ""revolution"" but, really, it's a rebranding. The very real sleep crisis we face isn't down to a few rich people thinking it's a waste of time; it's down to the 99% not being able to afford to spend time sleeping. 
While sleep is currently enjoying a moment, it will probably be short-lived. Sleep may be a performance enhancer but it's an inefficient one. The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can function on less sleep. Unsurprisingly, the military is at the forefront of this research. In 2008, the Pentagon published a report called ""Human Performance"" which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours' sleep. ""Suppose a human could be engineered who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). 
This would lead to an approximately twofold decrease in the casualty rate. An adversary would need an approximately 40% increase in the troop level to compensate for this advantage."" The report goes on to look at the effects of ampakines, a class of drugs that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain, to remove the effects of sleep deprivation. 
Eventually, humans will figure out a way to get rid of sleep. Spending a third of your life unconscious won't be a luxury anymore; it'll be something only the poor will be forced to do. At which point, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution.

"Former Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska has been cleared by the Justice Department's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him, his lawyer said Wednesday.
Former Sen. Ted Stevens, 85, of Alaska lost his re-election bid in November.
Prosecutors accused Stevens of failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms. But in December, an unnamed FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense, and the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday.
 His name is cleared, Stevenslawyer, Brendan Sullivan, told reporters. He is innocent of the charges, as if they 'd never been brought. 
Stevens, 85, lost his bid for a seventh full term in November after his conviction on seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms. Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of extraordinary evidence of government corruption. Watch more on the dismissal of the case 
 Not only did the government fail to provide evidence to the defense that the law requires them to provide, but they created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom, he said.
And one of Stevenslongtime friends, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, said Wednesday that Stevens was screwed by our own Justice Department. 
In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped.
 I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed, Stevens said. That day has finally come. 
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Tuesday hearing on the Justice Department's request to dismiss the case.
Sullivan, who is not related to Stevenslawyer, excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point. In December, two months after the guilty verdicts, the FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense and reported that someone with the government had had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen, an oil industry executive who was the government's key witness.
In the motion it filed Wednesday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen, the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska. The notes show that responses by Allen, the prosecution's star witness, were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens, and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial, the motion says.
 In light of this conclusion, and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial, Holder said in a written statement.
Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he called Stevens in Alaska on Wednesday and the former senator sounded elated, as anyone would. 
 Here's a guy who gave better than 60 yearsservice to the country and was screwed -- screwed by our own Justice Department, Hatch said. But he praised Holder for standing up and fixing this foul situation. 
 I think he's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter, and it's not an easy thing for him to do that, Hatch said. He has, in looking at it, realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also commented on the Justice Department's request, saying, Ted Stevens is 85 years old. He's already been punished enough. I 'm satisfied. 
And in a statement Wednesday, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that Stevens deserves to be very happy today. What a horrible thing he has endured. The blatant attempts by adversaries to destroy one's reputation, career and finances are an abuse of our well-guarded process and violate our God-given rights afforded in the Constitution.
 It is a frightening thing to contemplate what we may be witnessing here -- the undermining of the political process through unscrupulous ploys and professional misconduct. Senator Stevens... never gave up hope. It is unfortunate that, as a result of the questionable proceedings which led to Senator Stevensconviction days before the election, Alaskans lost an esteemed statesman on Capitol Hill. His presence is missed. 
The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team's conduct in Stevenscase, Holder said. Asked whether the prosecutors should be charged themselves, Sullivan told reporters, That is not my job. I 'm a defense lawyer. 
During the trial, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies he received from Allen's company, VECO, and from Allen himself. Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of StevensAlaska home, prosecutors said.
CNN's Terry Frieden, Paul Courson, Ted Barrett and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.

"That millennials rely heavily on technology is no secret. More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed, almost two thirds admit to texting while driving, one in five has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a profile on a social networking site. 
Compared to other generations, millennials are the most active on social media, according to a 2010 report, with 75% of them having created at least one social media account. In contrast, only 50% of Generation X, 30% of baby boomers and 6% of those aged 65 and older use social media. But there is a small percentage of millennials who don't use social media at all. Meet the millennials bucking the trend. 
Celan Beausoleil, 31, Oakland, California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an ""on and off, more off than on"" relationship with Facebook. 
She last deactivated her account in December 2015 after finding the amount of personal information shared by others ""too heavy"" to deal with on top of her work demands. 
""A lot of my job is listening to people's lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybody's life, including people that I don't really have a relationship with,"" she said. ""It feels almost like intimacy overload."" She added: ""I'm holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also."" 
But Beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way, citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on Facebook for as long as she did. ""One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someone's Facebook page from the other side of the world,"" she said. ""I used to do that all the time."" 
""One day, I realized I'm spending so much time doing this. These little seconds add up. I wonder what it would be like if I didn't spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else. What if I was doing other things with these seconds? What would they become? Would I enjoy it?"" 
Mathias, who works for the Baltimore City government, had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012. But he ""quickly forgot that Facebook existed"" after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence. He can still appreciate the benefits that come with having social media accounts, like when he met his girlfriend's friends for the first time and realized ""humanizing 20 people you're meeting at a party"" is much easier if you can connect their faces, hometowns and jobs to a photo later on. Or how easy it is to organize large events online. Mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he ""slips through the cracks"". 
But, now, he relishes the time that's freed up. He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed. And with no friends' accounts to follow online, he has to ""pick up the phone and call them"", something he's come to ""definitely enjoy"". 
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a ""pretty private"" person. So social media, which can open you up to the scrutiny and analysis of others, is not that appealing to her. ""I'm more privacy-minded and have concerns about giving out my data,"" said Raskauskas, who is currently looking for a job. 
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she ""didn't like everyone knowing what I was doing"". But Raskauskas, who was late to the Facebook game because her ""parents were really strict with technology"", can see the positive sides of social media. When a friend of hers that she'd lost track of moved to Naples for a month, Raskauskas didn't even realize she was there until after she'd left, which the 22-year-old said ""was a bummer"". 
But in the end, her privacy concerns outweighed any benefits social media could provide and she saw a definite upside when she went through a recent break-up. The last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online, it was not pleasant. 
""One time, I did break up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I was like 'Oh my gosh, should I change my profile photo? Should I change my status?' And, this time, I don't have to worry about any of that because that kind of stuff is pretty hard,"" she said. 
Rajagopalan, a student at Boston College, doesn't see any drawbacks to abstaining from social media. 
He claims that he ""hasn't seen any effect at this point"". Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said. ""Since I was young, I was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me,"" he said. 
In fact, the only time Rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable: it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college. Before starting his first year at college, he signed up for his first, and only, social media account. He joined Facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year. 
Months later, he still has the account but he admits: ""I don't use it. I don't check it or anything like that."" The most activity it sees is when his two sisters tag him in family photos. He has avoided social media accounts in all other situations, though he has felt the draw of Twitter. As a sports fan, he acknowledged that ""it's where most of the news breaks out"". But he refused to get an account, stating: ""I don't really need one to read tweets"".

"If you have a low income, are elderly, or are disabled, there are a number of public housing options in the United States. Public housing options are run by the federal, state, and city government agencies. Living in public housing is often called ""living in the projects"", but this is a negative term based on stereotypes. Not all public housing options mean living in huge, run-down buildings with lots of crime.
 
Public housing programs come in all sizes and types. One type is a single-family house. Another type includes living in a high-rise building, or apartments in tall buildings. All public housing options are rental options, meaning you do not own the place where you live.
Eligibility for public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your annual gross income, meaning how much money you make in a year. Another factor is if you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor taken into consideration is your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are only available to U.S. citizens or U.S. legal residents. Like with any rental, your references are checked to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. This means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with criminal records are usually banned or not allowed to use public housing options.
To find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an application. On the application you will need to list the names, gender, and date of birth of all people who would be living in the house or apartment.",B2

John is a busy lawyer, whose whole day revolves around two things: work and his two daughters. Balancing the two things often proves to be very difficult, so John spends most of his day in a rush to do everything he needs to do, and get everywhere he needs to be. With such a hectic schedule, it is common to find John and his children in line at a McDonald's drive-thru, waiting for some burgers, fries, and shakes.
 
""I know fast food isn't the healthiest thing I could give my daughters,"" admits John. ""But it's the most convenient thing around when we're in a rush. Plus, it makes them happy."" Unfortunately, this attitude towards the unhealthiness of fast food is one that so many parents in the U.S. hold, and it is easy to understand why.
Nowadays, nearly every single city in America is equipped with its own McDonald's. In Los Angeles alone, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every other corner when you're driving around. As if this didn't already make it hard enough for parents to avoid, McDonald's targets their famous ""Happy Meals"" to children so that every time they drive by the giant golden arches, children demand to go inside to get a new toy with their meal.
Although it may be very hard for parents to have healthier meal options for their children, doing so is a necessity that this country can no longer ignore. Constantly consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives. Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating everywhere they go. In the end, children will be more thankful for living long, healthy, and happy lives, than for getting a cheap toy in a cardboard box.",B2
"In the United States, the baby boomer generation includes those that were born in the time after World War II. Those babies are now reaching the retirement age. As these adults age, many of their adult children worry about how they will take care of their aging parents. In the United States it is not common for multiple generations to live under one roof. Once children grow up and get married, they move out, leaving their aging parents to fend for themselves. When these aging parents can no longer take care of themselves because of age or illness, it is not uncommon for adult children in the U.S. to place their elderly parents in a nursing home.
 
A nursing home is a facility that offers care for the elderly and ill 24 hours a day. As the name suggests, nursing homes has medical nurses, doctors, social workers, and therapists to help aging adults deal with the challenges of daily life. Most nursing homes also have social activities for the elderly to engage in and keep active. These activities range from games to dance classes, and movie nights. Nursing homes are supposed to provide three nutritious meals for their residents.
Nursing homes are controversial, however. There have been cases across the country of staff in nursing homes abusing and even robbing the elderly residents. There are different states and federal agencies that are supposed to oversee nursing home facilities. Some people feel that it should be the responsibility of family members, especially adult children, to care for their aging or ill parents. However, many adult children have their own children and families to take care of, and do not have the means to care for their elderly parents; others worry about medical skills needed if their elderly parents are seriously ill.",B2
"-LRB- CNN -RRB- I 'm Candida Moss and I am professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. I was an adviser on the True Cross episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in CNN's Finding Jesus series, which currently airs on Sundays.
Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the Finding Jesus Facebook page during the show. Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them. My apologies to everyone I did n't get to. Feel free to tweet your questions to me directly.
Herb Scribner: Can anyone explain to me what the Bible's deal is with 40 days/nights ?
Moss: It's more an interest in the number 40. In the Hebrew Bible the people of Israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the Holy Land. The flood lasts for 40 days and nights; Moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain; Goliath spends 40 days encouraging the Israelites to challenge him before David steps up; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married; in the book of Judges it is always 40 years between judges; and David and Solomon each reigned for 40 years. What we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full, complete period of time. It's sort of like a narrative stock number, in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three.
Yalanda M. Price: Was there any division between the followers of Jesus and the followers of John the Baptist ?
Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John does n't lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him. Nor, it seems, did John's disciples. They had separate ministries and, while there may have been contact between the two groups, they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace. There are some hints in the New Testament that Jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from John by stating that Jesusbaptism was better -LRB- Acts 11:6 -RRB- and countering the idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead -LRB- Matthew 14:2 -RRB- Some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of Jesus and followers of John.
Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin.
Jeffery Graff: Can the DNA tests on the bones indicate whether he is a Jew or even whether he is of the tribe of Levi ?
Moss: I 'm so glad someone brought up DNA. The DNA tests on the Bulgarian bones yielded only mitochondrial DNA -LRB- DNA passed down by the mother -RRB-, not the more reliable nuclear DNA -LRB- the kind of DNA referred to in forensic investigations -RRB-. In the original study of the Bulgarian relics -LRB- of which I was a part -RRB- the mitochondrial DNA revealed that the Bulgarian relics were of probable Semitic origin. Thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the Copenhagen scientists, I recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 %. The episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a Middle-Eastern man.
As for the more specific question about the genetics of Jews and members of the tribe of Levi: Current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start-up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information.
Cyndi Rosenthal: Are there any other historical references of John the Baptist outside of the Bible ?
Daniel Jose Camacho: Any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of John the Baptist ?
Moss: -LRB- These questions are on a similar topic, so I 've chosen to answer them together. -RRB- Actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of John the Baptist. This is important because it's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions John the Baptist in his book, The Jewish Antiquities. Josephus describes John as a good man who possessed virtue and had great influence over the people. According to Josephus, Herod put John the Baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion. This gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why John was executed and provides further evidence about just how important John was in his own day.

Daniel Jose Camacho: Wait, how did Jesus get Our Father prayer from Johnny B ??? Did n't catch that.
Moss: I 'm also really glad someone brought this up, because I wondered about it too. In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesusdisciples says, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. It's an interesting request that tells us something about John the Baptist's ministry and the demanding characters of Jesusdisciples ! In Luke, Jesus responds to this request by teaching them the Lord's Prayer. We do n't know that the Lord's Prayer came from John, and personally I do n't think it did; I think this is just how Luke shaped his version of events. But if you were just reading Luke you could come to that conclusion.

"Brazilian public notary Claudia do Nascimento Domingues set off a firestorm by granting Brazil's first civil union to a trio, an act so unprecedented that there is n't a word for it in Portuguese.
Uniao poliafetiva is the label she created. Polyfidelitous union is her best guess in English.
The relationship involves three professionals in their 30s -- one man and two women -- who, she says, live together, love one another as equals and are like any other non-married cohabiting couple -- except they are three.
What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a stable union, a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage, though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy. In short, it recognizes the trio as a family entity for public legal purposes.
Domingues has not released the identities of the three.
But not all are embracing the unique alliance.
 This union is void of any legality, said Regina Beatriz Tavares da Silva, head of the family law committee of a lawyersassociation in Sao Paulo.
Brazilian law defines marriage as a union between two people, so it is impossible for a civil union of three to be granted the rights of a marriage of two.
 It goes directly against the constitution, da Silva said. Monogamy is defined as relations between two, not three or four or five. 
The first-of-its-kind civil union has led to an outcry from religious groups, too. Those who fear the slipperly slope feel the ground moving underneath their feet.
 The institution of family can not be defended with the approval of actions that seek to distort its definition, the religious, conservative Plinio Correa de Oliveira Institute said in a statement. The purpose of this -LRB- union -RRB- is not to build families, but to destroy them. 
The controversial civil union is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations, though not all deserve judicial or legal standing, Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute for Family Law, said in a statement. The action carried out does not provide protections and does not confer rights. 
In his opinion, the legal action in question does nothing more than reaffirm that the trio in question believes that they are a trio.
Domingues, 39, argues that they deserve some benefits. They live together in Rio de Janeiro, they share a bank account, and they want protection in case of separation or death, she said.
Brazil is known for its progressive social policies and openness, as reflected in the status conferred to the trio, though the country is stereotyped, too. While Brazil appears to be a permissive place, it is also a a country where more than 86 % of the population identifies as Catholic or evangelical.
There was a similar outcry when stable unions between same-sex couples were allowed for the first time. The country's supreme court ruled that a gay couple in a civil union had the same rights as a married heterosexual couple, but there is debate about whether such rights can be extended to a trio.
But to Domingues, a public notary in the city of Tupa in Sao Paulo state, there is nothing preventing nontraditional relationships from being granted stable union status.
The trio considers themselves a family and is entitled to be seen as such in the public record, Domingues said.
 By registering them, I only confirmed that they recognize themselves as a family, she said. I do n't confer rights to them. That is up to a judge to decide. 
The civil union was actually granted three months ago, but news of it only spread this week.
Da Silva called the civil union deceitful, a runaround to grant status to a polygamous relationship.
Such relationships are n't new; they just have n't been recognized, Domingues said.
She says that she simply put her stamp of approval on a relationship that was surfing on a wave of cultural currents, but it was no coincidence that the request landed on her desk.
The trio from Rio, having been rejected by other public notaries, found their way rural Sao Paulo state and to Domingues because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity between the members.
Formerly an IT manager, Domingues now is a doctoral student at the University of Sao Paulo, studying family law.
Her dissertation, she said, is about how you can love more than one person at the same time. Her research looks at cultures, places, sociology, anthropology, religion and the history of family and intimate relationships in Brazil.
Through mutual friends, the trio found Domingues and traveled more than 600 miles from Rio, into the interior of Sao Paulo state, to Tupa.
Domingues does n't hesitate to call herself married, though she and her husband are bound by a stable union and not a civil marriage. Her husband works with her as a deputy public notary.
 We have had all the reactions you can imagine, she said.
Other polyfidelitous groups have reached out to her seeking the same civil union status.
Domingues is studying the cases of a quintet -LRB- two men and three women -RRB- and another trio -LRB- one woman and two men -RRB-.

"Prince Harry has flown out of Afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour, during which he admitted killing insurgents while piloting his Apache helicopter and spoke in rare depth about the tensions and frustrations of being a royal who craved life out of the spotlight. 
He also revealed his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family. 
A commander of the army's most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had fired on the Taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured Afghan and NATO personnel. His remarks may be seized upon by insurgents to stir anti-British sentiment, but the prince said he was only doing his job. Most of the time the helicopter acted more as a deterrent, he said. 
In a series of interviews during his time based at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles in his life. The prince, known as Captain Wales in the army, explained his 'three mes'. ""One in the army, one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that. So there is a switch and I flick it when necessary."" 
He admitted he sometimes 'let himself down' with his laddish behaviour, which he put down to ""probably being too much army and not enough prince"", but he said he was entitled to privacy, too. 
In another unusually frank exchange, he aimed biting criticism at the media, especially the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, three of the royal family's most ardent supporters in Fleet Street. He said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner to Spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war. ""No, it's not like that at all,"" he said. 
The prince said his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when ""I was very small"", but that he couldn't help monitoring the stories written about him. ""Of course I read them,"" the prince said. ""If there's a story and something's been written about me, I want to know what's being said. But all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do; not just about me, but about everything and everybody. My father always says, 'Don't read it'. Everyone says, 'Don't read it, because it's always rubbish'."" 
The prince was posted to Afghanistan last September to command a GBP45m Apache helicopter - one of the military's most sophisticated and well-armed aircraft. During his tour, the Apaches flew missions supporting NATO troops fighting the Taliban and accompanied British Chinook and US Black Hawk medical helicopters during casualty evacuations. 
Four years ago, the prince had to be spirited out of Afghanistan during his first tour after a media embargo was broken by mistake by an Australian magazine. This time, the Ministry of Defence chose to publicize his deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not give a running commentary on his life out there to allow him to get on with his job. Two-man crews from the BBC, Sky and ITN were sent once each to report on his visit, while a photographer and a reporter from the Press Association were embedded on all three visits. 
Asked whether he felt more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry, his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with Prince Charles. ""Definitely. I've always been like that. My father's always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that. But it's very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the army. Everyone's wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. I get on well with the lads and I enjoy my job. It really is as simple as that."" 
Shortly before he went to Afghanistan, the prince was caught in another media furore, when pictures emerged of him frolicking naked in Las Vegas during a private party. Harry said he had let himself down, but also blamed the media. ""I probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down. But, at the end of the day, I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. It was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army, and not enough prince. It's a simple case of that. 
""The papers knew that I was going out to Afghanistan anyway, so the way I was treated from them I don't think is acceptable."" He added, ""Certain people remind me, 'Remember who you are, so don't always drop your guard'."" 
Asked where he and his brother's fascination with helicopters came from, he said, ""Probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys.""
